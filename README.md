# Analyze-Qualitative-Data-using-AI

<p>In modern times new data is generated on daily basis across various sectors through customer feedback, surveys, and social media interactions. Which opens various possibility to understand human behaviours. However, analyzing this unstructured data manually is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often fails to uncover deep, actionable insights. Existing tools either oversimplify the complexity of human language or require advanced expertise to operate effectively. This creates a significant gap in the ability of businesses and researchers to fully leverage qualitative data for informed decision-making. There is a pressing need for an AI-driven solution that can efficiently process, interpret, and visualize qualitative information in a meaningful and scalable way.</p>
