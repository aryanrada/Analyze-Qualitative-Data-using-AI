There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I‚Äôm trying to do the splits, I‚Äôm reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you‚Äôll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

Even though deep down I feel like I would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. Not sure if that makes sense or not.

60,gnfhvp,False,None,84,"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.",Anxiety,"Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

All credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gnfhvp/anxiety_pro_tip_anxiety_thrives_on_your_avoidance/,2045,"Yep. And it an interesting exposition therapy but I also believe trauma can be an underlying cycle of ‚Äúdanger radar‚Äù that is turned on and it will be scanning your environment forever for danger. If you have trauma exposition therapy only gets you so far. Its interesting but if you get a therapist that is only surface leveling your personality traits looking for surface level adaptations might feel like you are going places but instead you are on the anxious track still, relieving pressure week by week on a substandard therapy leading nowhere.... If you think you have any kind of potential trauma event in your life, by all means try to find a therapist thar works with you. Shadow work is the way out for anyone suffering from unknown long term anxiety. Once upon a day long time ago your nervous system sent an alarm bell ringing to you and you did not listened to it, it probably got louder and you did not, could not, was blocked by something and you did not listened... then It generalized over the years as an unprocessed trauma cycle of hell.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,Anxiety,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds.

There's definitely crack pots out there so try to find a good one, but once you do it's life changing. 

She did an elimination diet with me so I basically could only eat quinoa and cooked vegetables with no seasoning and we slowly added things back into my diet to see the results. She put me on a bunch of supplements and then we did a blood test that tested for dietary intolerances (different than allergies) and I got a list of things to avoid. 6months later I was cured and have been fine for years after over a decade of trying everything else.

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

With new people I get slight anxiety but it‚Äôs not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort.

I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

162,gx2ksi,False,Work/School,55,UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,Anxiety,"As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today\_i\_had\_a\_job\_interview\_and\_i\_managed\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/) 

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work.

176,ej29di,False,Work/School,272,I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,Anxiety,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

189,9nmosq,False,Relationship,110,My best friend became a mass murderer. I‚Äôve never been the same since that day.,Anxiety,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It‚Äôs been several years, about 6, and while I‚Äôll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I‚Äôm just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn‚Äôt help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I‚Äôm pretty sure he either didn‚Äôt want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn‚Äôt even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn‚Äôt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn‚Äôt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he‚Äôd try to change the subject. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs smoke a bowl that‚Äôll cheer you up!‚Äù And that was when I had my first panic attack. I‚Äôm talking full on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die oh my god.‚Äù This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it‚Äôs caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can‚Äôt really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don‚Äôt really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he‚Äôs never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It‚Äôs hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can‚Äôt focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I‚Äôd love to answer, but I‚Äôd also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I‚Äôm in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that‚Äôs stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a ‚Äúhaha I got you‚Äù thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven‚Äôt responded yet, I will definitely try. I‚Äôll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9nmosq/my_best_friend_became_a_mass_murderer_ive_never/,1354,"Well that's a crazy story. Dude had some problems: shit happens. BFF, still had deeper shit going on: whatever. Did he kill you? No. Im guessing you're trippin cuz of the stress level caused by considering that ""your best friend"" might have been plotting on killing you. You know the dude. He might have killed his parents, but, honestly, you probably have the best insight as to his mindset, and why he might do it. Out of all the people, smoking weed, doing pills and that good stuff, he probably opened up more to you than anybody. But like I said: BFF's but still something deeper. He didn't kill you, so there you go :) Honestly, as ""crazy"" as killing sounds, it was the mainstay in civilization a good 500+ years ago... Violence and death isn't nice, but, its honestly part of life. Were so removed from violence that we don't even kill the food we eat: we get other people to do the dirty work. I think the ""panic"" is caused by not coming to terms with the reality... Smoking weed probably doesn't help, lol...

&#x200B;

I joined this sub because I conquered my anxiety, that started much like yours: smoking some weed. It was really just a matter of ""confronting my demons"" (in my case: ""confronting the thought that I was gonna die from a heart attack or something""...) It was just a matter of confronting it, and then a matter of self control after that... Its totally possible, and when you reach that level, its easy. Anxiety is just a lack of controlling your thoughts. I know this cuz I controlled my own thoughts to cure my anxiety (I know everybody with anxiety in this sub is gonna be like ""well if it were that easy, blah blah blah... Swear, I had ""heart beating out of my chest anxiety attacks"" before I cured it with self control.)

&#x200B;

Anyway: cool story. Pretty crazy, and sucks for the fam and whatnot, but interesting, to say the least...

I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups.

I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I‚Äôm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that.

205,gmezo7,False,DAE Questions,119,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?",Anxiety,"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fbq6n2/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_they_are_extremely/,1309,i feel you with this one. i‚Äôve never been lonelier in my life and i‚Äôve never isolated more in my life. it‚Äôs too exhausting and upsetting to be with people but at the same time... i miss the companionship üò≠ ,2020-03-01 06:31:05

216,amqy1o,False,None,58,Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual.,Anxiety,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I‚Äôve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I‚Äôve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said.

I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave.

281,aipmmi,False,None,78,It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,Anxiety,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b25lyk/things_that_helped_me_manage_my_anxiety_maybe/,1140,"I loved your post. Especially these lines:

I have to say progress can be very very slow, so we have to accept that.

"" My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. ""

I am still fighting and sad about why I feel the anxiety instead of just accepting that this is a part of me. The better I accept this, the easier dealing with anxiety will be.

I thank all of you for the support.

Btw I am seeing a therapist and he suggested meditation. On some days, its difficult to even meditate, but when I do, I feel better. I have also tried Zumba classes and coloring.

But I think, its so important to remember the first lines, it is a process, not a switch to turn off. Progress can be very very slow and there will be bad and good days. We have to keep going.

Reaching out to people online and offline, discord chats - helps a lot too.

Happy healing! ",2019-03-17 14:20:27

After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I‚Äôm just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It‚Äôs amazing and I had a great night. I‚Äôm so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing.

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

339,dyfwbm,False,Share Your Victories,84,Hadn‚Äôt Left the house in four years update.,Anxiety,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!

346,8z20x2,False,None,85,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,Anxiety,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn‚Äôt pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I‚Äôve been doing great! I‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  But I‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I‚Äôm surviving and doing things that make me happy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8z20x2/who_else_has_anxiety_about_not_doing_enough_with/,1092,"I think it's all about priorities.

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.

358,7ern0j,False,None,22,"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.",Anxiety,"I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes ‚Äî whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology ‚Äî it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion ‚Äî something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer ‚Äî often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom ‚Äî it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7ern0j/i_decided_to_fight_for_net_neutrality_even_with/,1074,Thank You So Very Much!!!!

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday.

English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è

I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, the better I feel.
* It‚Äôs just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don‚Äôt focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* It‚Äôs not what I have to do. It‚Äôs what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
* Don‚Äôt be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn‚Äôt be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept¬†the anxiety. Don‚Äôt try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch¬†the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act¬†normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don‚Äôt try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat¬†the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You‚Äôll see that you‚Äôll calm down soon.
* Expect¬†the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don‚Äôt focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me.

415,bjjn70,False,None,58,If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...,Anxiety," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

Try reframing some of these situations as 'learning experiences'. Acknowledge that you made a mistake or that something you have done could have been done better (this last one was a huge step in helping me accept constructive criticism as a designer).

But also know that it's alright to be frustrated or hurt and to cry over it. Feelings of disappointment are completely okay.

470,edx16n,False,Progress!,29,I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,Anxiety,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

471,8xlqik,False,None,74,Guys‚Äîfor the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,Anxiety,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there‚Äôs no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like ‚Äúoh no you don‚Äôt!‚Äù I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy‚Äînamely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT.

I get so anxious opening work related (and in general too) messages/DM's because of the need to reply since the sender can see that you've read said message to the point of rarely opening them now. Well I feel great for a day and then my anxiety increases more and more the longer I wait to read the message. I'm to the point that I want to let someone else open all of my messages and relay the info to me, but some of the message chains have so many unread messages that I'm now afraid of just seeing/hearing bad news related to not opening the prior message that'll make me even more anxious. 

I'm in this inbetween area it feels like where I keep telling myself that tomorrow I'll open all of them so it subdues my anxiety a bit and this keeps going on daily. I literally have no valid excuse to tell these people either so I feel like I'm just intentionally screwing myself over and probably causing problems (that I haven't even read about yet in the unread messages).

I dug myself this hole and hate feeling anxious all the time from it, but also hate how I feel slightly less anxious just ignoring it.

Edit: Thanks everyone just for even replying, it strangely feels good to know that I'm not alone at all in feeling this way.

477,cfbfvy,False,Relationship,51,First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,Anxiety,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth.

500,cc7boe,False,DAE Questions,75,Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,Anxiety,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/cc7boe/does_anyone_get_anxiety_from_feeling_like_youre/,913,"That's not anxiety, you're just excited to do something.

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on.

508,a0k03f,False,Helpful Tips!,69,A cool anxiety technique I learned,Anxiety,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible!

COVID induced pneumonia is what kills you. The mucus collects so thickly in the lungs that air cannot get through. Overweight and older people are higher risk because it‚Äôs difficult for them to breathe/cough. Basically you‚Äôre drowning in mucus.

578,b2b1t3,False,DAE Questions,113,Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,Anxiety,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure.

585,g4y8e7,False,Work/School,159,"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity",Anxiety,"I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety?

I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my ‚Äúadult life‚Äù.

Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat.

First, I am shocked this post was upvoted so many times. And I truly believe it wasn‚Äôt upvoted because of the victory you had, but because you made a very stressed point about not wanting to hear anything about Jesus. 

It deeply... deeply saddens me, grieves me to see such repulsiveness to the lord on your part. Where you are willing or have the thought of leaving to your car to get away from him. Before you stop reading, and yes I am speaking directly to the original poster, please hear me out. 

What exactly did God do to you to cause you to be so repulsed by him? Don‚Äôt blame it on the hosts. Because I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what this is all about. 

God, Jesus Christ, didn‚Äôt do anything to you to cause you harm. He didn‚Äôt cause any of this world to act the way it does. Mankind, in all his ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù fights tooth and nail against God because he thinks he knows better. And satan and his army of demons, work in the invisible world and heavenly places to seek out and destroy us. It is satan, not God who causes strife. 

If anything, you should be repulsed by CNN or any other news network for that matter, especially modern pop culture. It‚Äôs filled with the work of satan. 

Let me stress this again, God did not do anything to you to cause YOU to hate him. You hate him because you‚Äôve been deceived. 

God has done EVERYTHING he could to save us from our sin. When he said, ‚Äúit is finished,‚Äù on the cross, he meant it. Anyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved, our salvation is sealed in him. 

The fact is, in your current mindset and where your heart is, you are going to hell. Many are on that path. Many! The Bible says so. 

God loves us so much. You have NO IDEA how much he loves us. If you think for a second how hard this worldly life is, imagine how bad hell will be. With no second chances. And eternal separation from Jesus Christ, his love and his glory. 

Yes, I‚Äôm approaching this the classical hated way by so many who disbelieve by bringing hell into the equation. And I am standing my ground in this. Because that‚Äôs the final verdict for all who deny the one and ONLY living God. 

My intention is not to fear you into allowing the lord into your heart. My intention is to show you what‚Äôs on the line. God, is beyond good. He offers love like you‚Äôve never experienced. Your family, husband, kids or no one else can even come close to the love Christ offers. He is a gracious, loving, merciful and forgiving God. He‚Äôs coming back soon. 

I would hate to see you continue to hold on to so much hate for him and be eternally separated in complete agony. Christ said there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth there. Is it really worth leaning on your own understanding for these things? Your own understanding will get you no where. 

I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice all of my karma to stress to you how wrong you are right now. And it‚Äôs out of love. 

Over 700 people upvoted this post and it goes to show just how far separated we are from Christ. It deeply saddens me. We all have our own choices to make. And mine right now is to scream at you as loud as I can and say go the other way. You won‚Äôt be let down. 

What hope is there for any of us to live a part from God? Honestly ask yourself this question. What really matters in your life a part from God? My belief is a part from God, nothing.... absolutely nothing matters in this life.  If God is not the head of our life, we are dust in the wind. 

I pray you come to Christ someday. You won‚Äôt be popular, people will hate you, you won‚Äôt be upvoted, you‚Äôll be down voted because you speak in his name. But that‚Äôs ok. Jesus said the world hated him first and so we‚Äôll be hated as well as a result.

Wake up people! Jesus is coming back soon. Don‚Äôt be deceived! The day of the lord is at hand! And I can‚Äôt wait for it. But in the meantime, I desperately want to see people on Christ‚Äôs side. Not their own  misdirected side. 

Out of love to all!

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that‚Äôs how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don‚Äôt want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it‚Äôs not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it‚Äôs ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON‚ÄôT indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

I can‚Äôt even tell if it‚Äôs all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn‚Äôt even exist still. Simpler times.

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that.

615,gqmycs,False,Family/Relationship,75,Does anyone else have intense fear that they‚Äôll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,Anxiety,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill ‚Äújinx‚Äù it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she‚Äôs independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

I've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and I've been trying to figure out how to cope. Happiness/contentment does seem far away and even impossible at times, and in the case today, it led to nearly catastrophic panic attack today.

I'll admit, it's been a long while since I've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but I least I can take solace in the fact that I recognized the signs before things got out of control. Being able to understand, ""Hey, listen, you're having a panic attack,"" and enact a plan of action feels kind of liberating.

I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I‚Äôve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I‚Äôve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it‚Äôs likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don‚Äôt understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something.

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don‚Äôt even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don‚Äôt need to be told that I need medication or therapy.

619,acbd0s,False,Progress!,32,Aced a phone interview and I CAN‚ÄôT STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,Anxiety,"Three years ago you would‚Äôve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I‚Äôd either pass the phone to my family, or I‚Äôd be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I‚Äôd blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn‚Äôt even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They‚Äôd be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could‚Äôve said better, the ways I could‚Äôve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn‚Äôt write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I‚Äôm hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I‚Äôm here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much.

The hypothetical scenarios come to me as very frightening intrusive thoughts, mostly with myself or my children in danger.

I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

I used to be someone else. 

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who‚Äôs only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It‚Äôs so hard to put into words how I‚Äôm feeling. It‚Äôs like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can‚Äôt. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that‚Äôs consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There‚Äôs no trigger. There‚Äôs not single thing that starts it, because it‚Äôs a constant. It doesn‚Äôt ever stop. I‚Äôm currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I‚Äôm getting worse by the day. It‚Äôs like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I‚Äôm almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn‚Äôt have known that so many of you felt this way too.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I‚Äôd always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

I just think about my problems all the time and what‚Äôs plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

646,goab83,False,None,52,Slow Down. You are getting more than enough air.,Anxiety,"You are getting enough oxygen. Slow down your breathing. Oxygen is all around you, it is infinite, there is an abundance of it. You are in no danger of running out of it.

One of the most insidious symptoms of anxiety attacks is that you convince yourself you aren't getting enough oxygen. Then you make it true by hyperventilating.

I wanted to write this to help anyone going through what I go through on a near-daily basis, convincing myself I need more air, need to breathe harder, that I'm not getting enough oxygen.

Breathe only enough to power your body in the present moment. Don't worry if you will need more air later; you can - and will - get that later. A small breath is enough for now.

Your body is in fight or flight mode right now. It's hoarding oxygen to try and deal with imminent danger. It thinks you need a burst of energy to fight something, or sprint away. Your body is being silly, tricked by your mind. **There is no physical danger; you are safe and you know it.**

You control your body, just like you control your mind. Both of them are tools you have at your disposal. Neither controls the other, neither controls you. Right now your mind is demanding more oxygen from your body, as if it knows better. How *dare* it.

Focus on your body instead. Feel your arms, legs, your muscles. Are they running out of oxygen? No, they aren't. Right now, your heart is pounding because you are breathing too hard. There's too much oxygen, not enough carbon dioxide, you are hyperventilating and your heart is working doubletime to deal with all of that.

Your body knows exactly how much oxygen it needs. Don't be breathing until your mind tells you ""that's enough."" Breathe only until your actual body is content.

Try this if you are going through a panic attack.

On your next exhale, pause for a while before your next inhale. This will take some willpower. It will feel wrong, like you are suffocating, depriving your body of what it desperately needs. That is a lie. Do it anyways. You may start to feel a sensation in your head, almost like excess blood is draining from it. Whatever it is, don't run from it. That's the *calm* you are looking for. That's the carbon dioxide you've been depriving yourself of, and the real thing your body desperately needs.

Take in relaxed inhales. Your lungs do not need to be at full capacity. You may have to fight your mind on this. Just remember **you are getting enough air**. Your mind is being silly, you need to whip it into shape. Some things, like breathing, must be surrendered to your body. Make sure you relax when you exhale, do not contort your abs to squeeze out all the air in you.

Remember that inhaling is the only part of breathing that takes any energy. Exhaling is simply letting go.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/goab83/slow_down_you_are_getting_more_than_enough_air/,799,What if my parents light those thick ass incense that release a shit ton of smoke? ,2020-05-22 01:55:58

I called the hotline. I got help. I saw a psychologist. Diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. But also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

&#x200B;

But you are the only one who can defeat your anxiety. You‚Äôre gonna have to do it, no one else. And maybe it‚Äôs not as hard as you think. Maybe there are some simple steps you can take in your life right now, that will put you on the right path.

 

In this article you‚Äôll discover 7 anxiety tips that you can apply right now. If you follow these tips you‚Äôll be more effective at your work, have better relationships, and be a more happy and peaceful person.

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine

Caffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‚Äòanti-stress vitamin‚Äô B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. 

Note: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It‚Äôs best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline

People with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online

**It‚Äôs very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won‚Äôt be disturbed**. Most people don‚Äôt recover well enough from their daily stress. That‚Äôs why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we‚Äôll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach

Scientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‚Äòwatch‚Äô our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.

Breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It‚Äôs original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. 

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it‚Äôs actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven‚Äôt opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven‚Äôt checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you‚Äôre doing it. But when it‚Äôs done you‚Äôll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we‚Äôll feel.** 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week

Now most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don‚Äôt realise just how critical exercise is. In his ‚Äò*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*‚Äô  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** 

Exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. 

Pro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‚Äòbeing in the zone‚Äô, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It‚Äôs a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.

# Anxiety tip #7 - create an anxiety busting morning ritual

Most people grab their phone the second they wake up. This is about worst thing you can do to start your day. It‚Äôs very important we start our day on our own terms. We should let no influence from the outside bother us for at least the first hour of your day. Create a morning ritual for yourself that calms you and will give you the necessary strength to deal with your anxiety. 

We shouldn‚Äôt sleep on creating a morning ritual! It makes a massive difference if you start your day right. 

Those are my 7 tips for reducing your anxiety right now, so you can be more peaceful and more successful in your relationships, job, and your life.

At times it comes out of nowhere, while at other times people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, like me, feel anxious most of the time.

Having problems in your life which you don‚Äôt know how to solve, results in ongoing ruminations and negative thoughts of imagined outcomes which can lead to emotional reactions such as anxiety. Overthinking could be the source of your anxiety. People with anxiety tend to overthink everything in their lives. They obsess towards the things they need to finish or take care of. They have their own scenarios in their heads; playing it over and over again until they can‚Äôt-do anything because they‚Äôre stuck with their own thoughts.

If anxiety is affecting the quality of your life and your health, then you need to start focusing on [controlling your anxiety](https://themindsjournal.com/ways-control-unwanted-emotions/) immediately. Here are a few ways you can try:

1. Observe your thoughts

Do you have a negative thought pattern? Be aware and observe how your thoughts work. Whenever you feel negative or worried about something, question your thoughts and change your perspective.

2. Practice deep breathing

Deep breathing mindfully can work wonders with your anxiety. Practice deep breathing techniques like the 4-7-8 breathing technique as it will help you to calm down.

3. Take a walk

When you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, get out and take a stroll. Temporarily walking away from a particular situation often helps us to reset our mind and mood which alleviates our anxiety.

4. Start journaling

Write down whatever you feel, positive and negative, and note down all your thoughts to get them out of your head. This will help you to relieve some pressure from your mind.

5. Meditate

A daily 10 minutes [meditation](https://themindsjournal.com/meditation-for-beginners/) routine can help you become more mindful and control anxious thoughts a lot more easily when they come. If you find sitting silently too difficult, then you can also try some [alternate meditation practices](https://themindsjournal.com/7-informal-meditation-practices/2/).

6. Stay healthy

Exercising for 20 minutes three to four times a week can also help you manage your anxiety and stress levels. You can simply start by doing a simple cardio routine to start feeling the positive effects.

I am sure you will find these relaxation techniques helpful in controlling your anxiety. However, if your anxiety persists, it's best to visit a mental health professional.

I graduated high school in 2014. I was a terrible student. I skipped classes like nobody else did. Not because I am ‚Äúlazy‚Äù, but because my anxiety was so high that it totally hindered my ability to stay in class. 

After I graduated, I spent 2015 and 2016 housebound. Agoraphobic,  depressed and fucked up, with no perspective in life. I never imagined I could even enter the room where an university entrance exam would be applied. And I mean it. I couldn‚Äôt imagine myself there. I couldn‚Äôt even go to the supermarket that is literally in front of my house. 

A miracle happened by the end of 2016. I decided to take an exam, just to TRAIN. To see if I could stay locked in a room with other people for hours. I never expected to pass the exam. I never expected be able to get into the *best university of the continent I‚Äôm from*. I still don‚Äôt believe in it... kind of. 2017 was like a dream or something to me. I still can‚Äôt believe I made it.

I still have problems. Many problems. I am still anxious, and my anxiety is still an obstacle in my daily routine. However...

I am not hopeless anymore. I can look to the horizon and see a brighter future. I can see myself graduating, I can see myself in a job, and I can see myself slowly getting more socially confident. I feel I can make it.

Please, never, never give up on yourself. Even if you are housebound or jobless, skipping all of your classes, even if nobody else around you believe in you, keep going. You are much stronger than you think you are, I guarantee it. I experienced it. Just put yourself in a situation where you have the possibility of improving and making some kind of progress.

I used to love reading, playing ukulele, drawing, playing video games. Now I get a huge feeling of anxiety creep over me when I try to get back into them.

 I think its a confidence issue? Like not feeling good enough at playing the ukulele, or not being good enough at drawing or playing games. I went to a private school where competitiveness was drummed into us. I was considered dumb because I didn‚Äôt get A* in everything and I really tied my self-worth to my abilities academically. 

Now I feel like my self-worth is tied to my pastimes. They‚Äôre meant to be the things that make me interesting as a person, I should be good at them and see progress in them. Am I even the person I think I am now that I‚Äôm too anxious to do any of these things? 

Another issue is feeling anxious that I‚Äôm possibly wasting time. I used to love sitting playing games for hours but now I feel this weight on my shoulder and pain in my chest. I feel like I should be doing something more proactive, even if I have nothing else I really need to be doing. 

I‚Äôve started working with polymer clay because its something new and therapeutic and creative. I‚Äôll hopefully see some progress and build up my confidence in myself, instead of feeling like I‚Äôve lost the knack for things I used to enjoy.

This is an odd question that has plagued me off and on for a few years..... I am posting here since my anxiety has been my most dominant mental health issue in the last few years. 

Also because I think this is actually a pretty big problem (for me at least). It only breeds more hate in my heart which I don‚Äôt need when I‚Äôm already juggling so many things. 
A lot of times I find myself so shaken when I see other people, especially people I might‚Äôve gone to high school with for instance, doing so well mentally. They are able to handle so much more (perhaps they take more college classes, work more than me; etc) and still maintain a happy and overall positive attitude. Meanwhile I struggle to get out of bed most mornings and am trying to keep up my motivation enough so I don‚Äôt drop out of school again.

I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as a ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù post. I realize what my problems are and also realize I am the only one who can help them.

I start losing sleep, I toss and turn at Night before this scheduled thing thinking and thinking about the worst thing ever happening tomorrow to me, when in actuality it never turns out to be that bad.

I‚Äôm back at home and don‚Äôt want to go out again and will probably get into bed again and I still feel awful. But I have oranges now.

From what I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs a positive feedback loop, doing one tiny thing gives you a dopamine boost, which is the motivation neurotransmitter, this then makes you feel more able to do another small thing, and so you build up and eventually hopefully can do more.

743,e96211,False,None,98,Reminder of a few important unnoticed characteristics of anxiety you might have missed,Anxiety,"- It urges you to find a solution ASAP, there is an element of hurry and unnecessary haste.

- It urges you to find the perfect solution right away and rejects everything but the perfect solution

- It plays with your memory and conveniently distorts successful events into memories of failure because of catastrophising

- Because anxiety is often accompanied by depression, memory is foggy and because your animal mind realises that your memory is unreliable it adds more and more fear-based shortcuts to prevent you from forgetting the right response to several common daily situations. This obviously makes your life entirely poisoned and anxiety driven.

The software engineering equivalent would be using only exception handling and error handling to handle conditional statements like 'if' and 'switch/case'.

You can come to rely on an elaborate system of pain-trigger-responses (exception handlers) rather than normal behaviour (if/switch) and live in misery and still be highly functioning. This is typically with people who have anxiety for many years or decades.

So if you have a temporary or recurring memory dysfunction (depression, neurological injury, nerve damage, brain injury, migraines, constant headaches), normal visualisation may become difficult and in order to function and not go blank and forget things all the time, you might start using your limbic system to make memory shortcuts instead of your brain. This causes constant anxiety.

- You could use the name  ""fight/flight/freeze response"" or ""exaggerated limbic system response"" instead of the name ""anxiety""

The name ""Anxiety"" makes it sound like it is a mysterious human disorder, whereas it is clearly about the ""stupid"" animal mind inside us, and it pushes the blame correctly on the limbic system, taking away the mystery and ""unknown"" aspect of it, **thus making it much more benign and robbing it of its primary weapon - fearsomeness**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/e96211/reminder_of_a_few_important_unnoticed/,738,Thank you.

I actually came at a pretty bad time, because the theater was absolutely packed with kids and parents. As a 22 year old male, I stuck out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, the lights were low when I walked in, so nobody even gave me a second glance.

I was reminded of this before a recent first date. I was pacing back and forth, getting more and more nervous. My roommate said ""it's a first date, of course you're nervous"". I stopped pacing. Wait, that actually makes sense, it's completely normal to be nervous before a first date. In fact, I would say not being nervous is actually weird. I'm being normal and I need to stop reacting to my anxiety like it's not normal. I need to stop fighting it.

It's very easy to get stuck in the mindset of ""If I'm not completely comfortable, then that is bad."" - but it's important to remember that there is a lot of distance between comfort and uncontrollable anxiety. A lot of the people here have been on the extreme end of anxiety, it SUCKS, and it's something we'll have to continue to battle. But we should also realize that the early stages of anxiety are sometimes very normal, felt by most people.

Willing myself not to puke.,Anxiety,"Long story, but over a couple months, one of my bosses had been sexually harassing me. I kept trying to brush it off, but I didn't know how to stop it and it was making me extremely uncomfortable being around him. I had worked for this person for two years without incident, and he knows about my anxiety, need to please others, and my conflict avoidance. Literally one of my weaknesses in my performance evaluation is ""trouble saying no to people"". I am also half his age and he is many levels above me in the company. I was the perfect target. I finally confided in my supervisor, who gave me the courage to step forward. 
I wrote out a log of days and times and what occured, which was a good idea timeline-wise, but also kept me from having to repeat out loud what was said and done to me when I went to HR. HR was very professional and took it seriously, telling me it wasn't my fault and they were glad I came forward.
My harasser is on unpaid suspension while they conduct an investigation, interviewing others in his department to see if anyone else has observed anything else. 

I have a meeting with HR, the CEO, and the VP in an hour and I can't stop panicking. I don't know what they will ask me. And I am completely mortified that they all know what I let happen. I also feel intense guilt for ruining his career. He was the face to many of our projects, and I'm throwing such a wrench into it. I really trusted him, so when this all started, I had no idea what to do.

770,gcgt1r,False,DAE Questions,92,Does Anyone Else Wish They Can Go Back To The Kid Version of Themselves?,Anxiety,"I'm not talking about going back to childhood and not having any responsibilities, etc. I mean still being an adult........but going back to the same temperament you had when you were a kid. Psychological temperament.

When I was a kid, I did not have any of the anxiety disorders I have now. I felt like pretty much everyone else (normies). Anxiety never stopped me from doing anything. If I wanted to do something, I'd get it done. 

Interacting with other human beings felt more organic and easy. There was no anxiety involved. I didn't even try........it just happened (I'd imagine that's how its supposed to be). Everything was so easy.

Now as an adult, I am a mess of anxiety disorders. It hampers my life in so many ways. The anxiety came during my teenage years. I can't understand why it just suddenly came out of nowhere.............anxiety being such a serious problem that it is....you'd think it should start right from the minute you were born. But its not. It came at a certain point. And that's how anxiety works for most people. It comes during their teenage years. Not in childhood.

If we were that way in childhood, why can't we reach that state again? Is it possible?

I feel like we've all just been corrupted in some way. And I don't mean corrupted in a bad way. I mean corrupted like a hard drive. When hard drives gets fragmented, they don't function like they used to. Normies are simply people who haven't undergone any fragmentation. So that's why they maintain the same temparement they had since they were kids. 

That's why they don't understand what social anxiety is. Because socializing is inherently a pleasurable act..........but anxiety can insert itself into that natural process and '' fragment '' it. 

It's not even like I'm asking for anything unrealistic or out of my reach (like becoming a millionaire or something). What I want is something that I've already experienced!

-	Panic attacks / anxiety means cortisol levels are high
-	It's next to impossible to think happy thoughts when there‚Äôs cortisol everywhere

In May of 1986, I, too, was gang raped at a high school party by boys that I knew, while I was intoxicated.  I am not going to share the details of the attack,  I am willing to say that I was hospitalized afterwards with significant injuries and I was unable to attend  my high school graduation because I was in the hospital.  Although I am pretty sure that my parents knew my injuries weren‚Äôt from ‚Äúfalling down in the woods‚Äù and the medical practitioners that examined me were very much aware that I didn‚Äôt just fall down.. no one addressed the true nature or extent of it.. even me.

I never talked about it. I never wanted to. I never wanted ‚Äújustice.‚Äù  I wanted to make it go away because for a long, long time I felt like it was my fault. 

After 32 years.. it‚Äôs right there.. all over again.

I want to scream at every Facebook poster that has something obnoxious to say about Ford not coming forward.  I want to punch everyone who says ‚Äúwell, she was drunk‚Äù or ‚ÄúBoys will be boys.‚Äù  I want to vomit every time someone says ‚Äúwhy did she wait so long?‚Äù and worse.. ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt do anything..he just didn‚Äôt help her.‚Äù

Update: thank you so much everyone for the positive messages! I walked in feeling super confident, but.... 

I did not get the job. It turns out that I was vastly unprepared for the interview and I had no idea. The interviewer (internal promotion) explained to me that other applicants had gone to the location of the available job (store site) and spoke with different employees they would be working with, requested detailed financial statements and wrote up 90 day day-by-day plans for the store. 

Looking back now it seems obvious, but having been a temporary employee of that store when they were short staffed I figured I already had an insight to it and the day to day operations. I had asked a senior employee who has had the position I was interviewing for what I needed to do to prepare and he never mentioned any of these things. I know he didn‚Äôt do it maliciously, he‚Äôs a very scatterbrained person and was hand picked for the roll rather than going though the application process. 

Lucky for me my company wants employees who are eager to grow. The interview turned into a discussion about my current location and what is expected of me the next time I apply for a promotion. 

I was terrified that  I would make a catastrophic mistake during my interview and I did. While being so worried about my future with the company and being black listed if I messed up I had forgotten that the interviewers and managers are good and honest people who want to help their employees grow and succeed. Even if we do fail, sometimes there‚Äôs a hand ready to help us back up.

I'm hurting but what if it isn't real? 

There is a duality to the doubt I feel, 

Outward initially, then turned inside - 

Did this even happen? Do I see this right?
 
Can I trust my mind?

Is my memory real or is it defined

by my own narrative?

Of course it is.

Then how do I believe it? How do I know it's true?

If this is just in my head then what do I do?

Am I everything I hate, defined? 

As bad as those I strike down in my mind? 

The jury is out and it seems almost unanimous, 

But what if the crime was committed by one of us? 

The judge is scornful and asks with derision, 

Are you even capable to make this decision?

After all, you wrote your own dialogue. 

Internal monologue, set thrusters to overdrive. 

Constantly in fight or flight, zoom in, analyse. 

Please give me some peace. 

Peace comes to the dead.

I don't want to be die,

But perhaps it might be nice 

To have a rest.

Why can I see so many things?

Not a hallucination, that's not what this is.

It's a sight I can't see with my eyes.

The connections, the links, the things that make my heart stop.

They're not visual but they exist.

They exist in my mind, and my mind alone.

I state them aloud and in pours the doubt. 

I made this.

I have created something, what is it?

Oh, it's anxiety. Hello. 

Sit with me a while. 

Am I propogating my own downfall?

This person is hurting me, let me tell you.

This is all the things that they do;

It doesn't sound bad enough. 

It sounds petty, pathetic, petulent and pitiful, 

Not like it should cause the pain that I go through. 

Yes, I'm being negatively affected by external factors,

But I'm the one processing them.

Am I doing this right?

Is this okay?

Am I validated for feeling this way?

Did I put myself in the wrong situations,

Or have I convinced myself they're bad?

Would things be fine if I saw this differently?

Paint on a smile, adopt positivity, 

Or is that accepting less than I deserve?

What do I deserve anyway?

Decency. Respect. Honesty.

Love, maybe.

But why? 

Do I give these to others?

Can I?

The main point of contention -

Is everything I know just an invention?

We're judged on our action and not our intention.

I'll never see how another sees me, 

So how will I ever truly rest easy. 

Would people be honest? Am I?

You get back what you put into the world.

Did I put this out? Is this projection?

Is this a narrative for my own protection?

I don't feel very safe.

Have I made myself a victim?

Or did other people harm me?

Did they shatter the glass, or did I?

Pandora had hope in her box of demons.

I wonder if doubt always sat on it's shoulder, 

Nesting, infecting, and spilling all over? 

Will things get better, is this just situational?

Are they too broken or too confrontational? 

Or maybe, just maybe, it's me.

I'm always the common denominator, see. 

Am I putting myself in punishing places?

Seeing the lies behind smiling faces? 

Or have I just framed it that way? 

Everything bad happens to me.

Does it really?

I'm resilient. I get through.

Look at everything I've had to do.

I'll tell you, but it's from my point of view.

So how do we know even know if its true?

What would you say? And would I believe you? 

Where do I go when I can't accept my own truth, but can't accept another either?

I view everything I perceive through a fear being
deceived. 

Can any of us be believed? 

I don't trust because I don't want to be wrong.

But then I can't trust myself. 

What if I'm the one with the big bag of tricks?

Pull the wool over my own eyes.

Fill my mind with my own-brand lies.

Is there respite? 

Is there relief? 

Whats the cure? 

Is it self belief? 

How do I believe what I know can't be fact? 

How is everyone else maintaining that act? 

Am I alone?

I feel alone, I whisper, to no one.

803,a7az4h,False,None,109,"Deactivated fb, it was damaging me mentally. No one has even noticed!",Anxiety,"Last Saturday morning, I deactivated fb (with a view to letting it delete after however long it takes). I found that despite 400+ 'friends', I actually wasn't enjoying it at all anymore. I know it's a clich√©, and not real at all, but seeing people live their seemingly perfect lives, going out together, watching the little cliques develop and feeling increasingly left out, I decided enough was enough. It's not helping my mental health in the slightest. It has to go.

It is, admittedly, somewhat cathartic and liberating to no longer be a part of that social media network. I still have the ability to use messenger, so can still talk to people. But I think what's hurt a little more is literally only one person has noticed I'm no longer active on there. Which I suppose really hits home how insignificant my online presence was.

I feel very lonely. Friends that used to message me daily no longer message at all, and if I message them, it just gets left on 'read'. There are only so many times I can try, before I stop because clearly they won't respond.

There were so many of those friends that consistently would post / share memes etc about depression, anxiety; suicide. About how much they care and how we should all reach out if we haven't heard from someone in a while. The irony is, no one has. And despite not wanting to believe it, I don't think anyone will.

I work, I go home, walk / feed / play with my dog, then go to bed. I'm usually in bed by 8.30pm (up at 6am) because there seems little to stay awake for anymore.

I've posted on here once or twice, yo other subreddits, but never to this depth of revealing my feelings. I honestly don't mind if no one resounds, it's just useful for me to get this out of me.

I hate feeling sorry for myself, and I hate burdening people, even strangers - so anyone that reads this! with my ridiculous insignificant problems.

Based on your schedule, it doesn't seem you have many opportunities for engaging with new people? If you don't mind, I'd like to recommend the book (or audiobook) ""The Like Switch"". I myself am re-learning how to make friends from scratch after a similar situation, and learning how put myself in situations where making friends is even possible and it is helping immensely. Not only with teaching me how I've gone wrong in the past (without even realizing it), but turns out there is a SCIENCE to making and keeping friends that you can learn, even with anxiety. You don't have to struggle through by doing it ""the hard way"".

804,9x65wy,False,Helpful Tips!,88,What people think is a cure for anxiety is actually one of its causes.,Anxiety,"When I am feeling anxious and am searching the internet for advice I often come across some form of this:

""Understand that your anxiety is illogical and that you aren't actually in danger""

Suggesting that if you realize this, the anxiety will go away. In my experience it is the exact opposite. Just feeling anxious is one thing. I've felt anxious before big events, it's not pleasant, but if I don't fight it, it comes and goes and I move on. But feeling anxious and knowing you shouldn't be is where the problems really start. When I am anxious and know I shouldn't be, I worry that something is wrong with me and that adds to my anxiety. I can stay like this for weeks or months and I only seem to be able to break the cycle when something especially good happens and I get distracted enough to stop rejecting how I am feeling.

In the last year I have had considerable success overcoming anxiety by accepting it when it comes. This is way harder than it sounds. It's like flexing a muscle you didn't know you had. When I start feeling anxious, I make the conscious effort to accept how I'm feeling. I can't pull it off all the time, but I'm getting better and better at it. The trick is that you have to really believe it. You have to decide that how you are feeling is completely acceptable. You can't trick yourself and ""accept"" your anxiety in the hope that it will go away. You have to really be OK with it sticking around, and just like that it will be gone. It will come back, but you will be building up a skill that will allow you to once again let it pass.

Edit: Talking with several other anxiety sufferers, I'm finding that this advice is more applicable to people who experience chronic low-level anxiety and less applicable to people who experience acute panic attacks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9x65wy/what_people_think_is_a_cure_for_anxiety_is/,696,"""I accept and allow these anxious feelings""

I highly suggest you try the book ""DARE"" by Barry McDonagh

He details a response akin to what you are describing. I listen to the audio book when I drive to move through anxiety and panic and remind me of the mantras.

It also helps to reframe your anxious feelings by thinking of them as excited feelings. Since your body goes through virtually the same process for those responses, reframing as excitement may give you a different reaction to those feelings.  ",2018-11-15 00:55:31

Indeed, it is tempting to want to ""get to the point"" where your normal state involves taking it easy, but remember:  this desire is characterized by the same perception that induces anxiety in the first place (namely, needing to be somewhere other than where you already are or doing something other than what you are already doing).  The problem with this attitude is that it considers your happiness to be dependent upon the future attainment of some condition which doesn't presently exist; this, however, only defers your happiness to the future each time you think you have finally grasped it.  If you posit happiness or peace or calm as states which lie outside of the present, then you are setting up yourself to fail in the present to achieve them.

Adjusting your time-horizons and breaking down your long and mid-term goals into smaller, short-interval steps can alleviate some of this frustrating anxiety about the future.  The need to know the future lies in our fear of its uncertainty.  Engaging in what you can handle NOW will keep your mind attending to things you can perceive with some certainty and tackle with a modicum of control, while keeping you motivated to keep going.

She gave me Louis' number and the number of 3 other therapists.

After delaying for weeks, I called all of the referrals I was given. Two weren't taking new patients, one wasn't returning my calls and the 4th was Louis. What are the chances that I would like the only Therapist that would see me? (well, 100%)

I was really nervous about meeting Louis because I had never been to therapy before. I had no idea what to expect. Would he judge me? Would he yell at me? Would he humiliate me? Would he intimidate me into taking action? I wasn't sure, but decided that I was willing to try.

Louis was a short Jewish man that reminded me of the actor Saul Rubinek (Warehouse 13) with a trendier, gray, beard. He had a very soft way of communicating that made you feel instantly comfortable. After meeting him once, I knew that we were going to get along. Sometimes in life, you just click with people instantly. This is how it was with Louis and me. :)

As I went to each session, I discovered that Louis and I had tons in common: we experienced many of the same issues. So his recommendations felt tailored to me. In a way, talking to Louis was like talking to an older version of myself. We had different upbringings, I was raised Catholic and he was raised Jewish, but there we so many parallels between our lives that he would instantly be able to tell me his version of my story and how he dealt with it. This was the reinforcement I needed to prove to myself that everything was going to be okay. I was in good hands.

Don't get me wrong, not every session in 4 years was pleasant. But every session was productive. He knew how to see past my BS. He knew how to get to the core of the issue. And the amazing thing was that the days that I thought I had nothing to talk about were the days that we made the most progress.

Basically, when you don't think you have anything to talk about, it's usually because you have been trained to see past your BS. This means that you can actually start making some significant forward movements. 

Now, after 4 years of treatment. I am feeling fantastic and it is thanks to Louis. My goal when I started therapy was as follows:

To be myself without reservation, without shame, and without apology. 

Louis helped me to do these things by supporting the work I did as a vlogger. He helped me to talk publically about dealing with anxiety. He helped me to turn my weakness into a super power.

Now...

Today, while on a hike, I found out that Louis had passed away via the internet. I hadn't heard from him in few weeks and decided to give his office call. His message had been replaced with a referral service. I instantly typed ""Obituary Louis..."" and discovered that he had passed away 3 days ago, and I had just missed his funeral earlier in the day. 

The feelings came rushing in, but there was no Anxiety. It was just a combination of sadness and joy. As I walked through the park, I cried and laughed - I must have looked like a crazy person. 

I cried because I lost a great friend. I laughed because I was full of joyful gratitude. He saved my life. And, to me, gratitude is displayed as laughter with tears.

I decided that, while I missed his funeral, that I would place flowers at his office door. His office was right next door to a supermarket; so I ran in and got some flowers and a card. I quickly returned to my car and added the line... ""Louis was a blessing in my life.""

I exit my car and head towards the building only to be accosted by a parking attendant for the supermarket, ""You can't park here..."". I turn with flowers in hand, ""My friend is dead, I just want to show him some respect."" 

We argued a little and I told the attendant, in a frustrated tone, ""Fine! I will move my car!"" I could tell that he was kind of regretting telling me to move the car, due to the circumstances, but I just didn't have the time or energy.

I ran up the stairs to Louis' office, placed the flowers and the card at the door, and returned to my car. All I could think of is that Louis would have wanted me to apologize to the parking attendant. 

I drove toward the attendant... He looked me in the eye as I approached. Probably thinking I was going to flip him off or something. But I channelled my friend and said, ""I want to apologize. I was a jerk to you. My friend died and I am a little upset. But he trained me to see when I am spreading my pain around. You were just doing your job."" 

The attendant told me, ""I am feeling really bad about this..."" I told him ""I am sorry for making you feel bad, but I am grateful to you because you have helped me to see that the lessons, that my friend taught me, will always be with me. 

Louis will always be with me, as my shoulder angel.

Thank you Louis. 
I love you!

831,6okkl2,False,None,32,posting on Reddit gives me anxiety - so this is me fighting that anxiety,Anxiety,"I have been a lurker on Reddit, and many other sites on the internet for many years now. It took me years until I could even bring myself to make a Reddit account (and other accounts.) However, I could not bring myself to post anything or any comments no matter how badly I wanted to. In the past, I have posted a few things when I had been feeling brave enough to overcome my anxiety, but I always go back into hiding.

The internet, and Reddit, is supposed to offer a free medium for people to freely express and share their ideas, creations, thoughts, and opinions. Despite amazing, silly, and positive things happening on Reddit everyday, on social media there is social pressure. People wishing to get validation from others (karma, gold, upvotes, etc.) Trolls, negativity, people fighting for the top comment or post.
Before I even wrote this I researched and found several older /r/Anxiety posts about the same topic, and even a whole article describing how I felt.

Even though I tell myself that I don't care about validation from others, that I don't care about what others think or being judged, I still get anxiety. In the back of my mind, I still have fear that whatever I have to say or do is not worth expressing. That someone has said it before, or that its unoriginal, or that it simply isn't good enough. That all of my thoughts are invalid. And because of that I shouldn't even try. Better nothing than a negative outcome.

On top of subconsciously fearing others, I fear myself. That whatever I have to say will never be perfect enough or amount to enough. That my high expectations will never be met anyway so why even try.
All throughout my school life, I have also struggled to complete anything (anything that involves writing or artistic projects) because of anxiety. It was either 100% or 0%. Which was not a healthy way of doing anything.  This post in itself is being written and re-written for weeks now.

But at the moment, I am writing this post to try to battle those thoughts in my head. Something, anything, is better than nothing. This post is to tell my anxiety that it doesn't matter who reads this post or how I write it, just the fact that I did it. That it doesn't matter if what I write or do is perfect, or the best or the worst, or way too long, but that it exists. And that my thoughts are valid because they exist. 
As long as am I alive, I am going to keep trying to find the courage to express myself and allow those thoughts to exist. Reddit is just one small way of doing so.

I had gotten kinda out of shape as I haven‚Äôt been to the gym now for around 3 months.

I kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if I get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? No one really cares about what others do in the gym.

859,4p6r8y,False,None,74,Be aware of your distorted thinking,Anxiety,"In general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.

Personally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. 

1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. 

Examples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most ""What if..."" type thoughts. 

2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly ""grey area"". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. 

Examples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- ""If it's not positive than it must be negative"". -On diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire XL pizza & wings b/c your diet is ""ruined"" anyway due to the cupcake. 

3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the ""worst possible case"" does come true.  

Example: ""If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats."" When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.

""It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me"" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. 

4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. 

Example ""That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward"". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.

5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. 

Example: ""That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me"" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 

6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to ""evidence"" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. 

Example: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).

What types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? What are some specific examples?

&#x200B;

I would actually say the worst symptom of anxiety for me is a fear of confrontation.  Even when I'm 100% in the right, having to call someone out on their bullshit can be enough to induce a panic attack.  

&#x200B;

Its only gotten worse with age.  When I was a little bit younger I""d push through the anxiety and make sure my voice was heard, I would say avoiding confrontation is a behavior I've learned over the years and now it's almost impossible for me to confront someone without stuttering and stammering through it, and that is if I even have the balls to confront someone in the first place.  

 

Then, I wind up even more pissed off and upset because I end up letting someone walk all over me and then my anxiety gets even worse, or I just shut down and get super depressed.

Over the years I have used CBT, therapy, and mindfulness meditation to reduce my anxiety with moderate success, but I still ‚Äúslip‚Äù a lot and it can come back with a vengeance sometimes. 

I recently kind of ‚Äústumbled‚Äù into exercise. I used to hate it and dread it as nothing more than a means to burning calories and eventually losing weight. But after reading a ton on how it can help anxiety and depression (which I‚Äôve known for years) I casually just said ‚ÄúOk what the heck?‚Äù. Lots of people take medicine everyday for anxiety, why can‚Äôt I try this as a form of medicine? 

So for the last week, my husband and I have been waking up at five to work out before work (I‚Äôve learned that it NEVER happens after because I‚Äôm a teacher and I get exhausted at work). The results? AMAZING. I have felt more at ease in the last week than I have in years. I only work out for thirty minutes and I do a variety of strength and cardio. The type of exercise does not seem to have any effect on the amount of relief. Even just a brisk walk can do it. I can not recommend it enough. Don‚Äôt wait to try it like I did. Seriously. A doctor gave me this advice years ago and I wish I would have listened. Go get your CDC-recommended 150 minutes a week and see what it does for your anxiety. I think you will be amazed. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9288r9/exercise_seriously_do_it/,662,"A bit of blanket advice to the handful of ‚ÄúGood for her, not for me‚Äù/exercise phobia responses.

First, I completely respect that anxiety is like a fingerprint, it takes a different form in everybody and I may not understand your anxiety just like you may not understand mine. I understand that you may feel exercise increases your anxiety. There are three probable reasons for that: one, you are over-exercising (too frequently at too high of an intensity or for periods longer than 45 minutes) which is raising your cortisol levels. Two, you haven‚Äôt *really* given it an honest shot (at least 20 minutes of keeping your heart rate up) so it‚Äôs not doing anything for you. Three, your negative self talk is pre-determining your failure so that even if you try you think ‚ÄúAh not gonna work for me.‚Äù

I say all of this with the kindness and love that I would to a friend, but I think a lot of us fall into that third category. The anxious mind is GREAT at coming up with excuses for things we don‚Äôt really want to do. But I promise if you can just ignore that voice for a week and do it anyway, you will more than likely see a huge benefit from exercising. The human body is made to exercise and it is no coincidence that levels of anxiety in the population have raised with the levels of a sedentary lifestyle.

I‚Äôm so happy I could cry! So there I was, at Starbucks, I had too much caffeine (which I shouldn‚Äôt truly be consuming to begin with) and I feel a panic attack coming on and coming on strong. 

Usually I try to shove it down. It never works but I still do it until I inevitably spiral.

But there was this barista sweeping by me. He and I had spoken a few times before this visit and I recalled him saying he was taking a summer course at the nearby community college.

I had my earphones in, trying to listen to music and shakily eat a bagel to calm down. I have social anxiety and have been trying to do some things to get over that these past few weeks such as, smiling when I make eye contact with people and attempting to have casual conversations. 

But there I was, debating whether or not I should even try casually talking to this guy in the midst of forcing back a panic attack and a strong urge to cry. After about a minute (maybe a few, not sure it felt like eternity though) I just turned my head to face him and did it! I asked him how his class was going and although I was very shaky (vocally and physically), we ended up having a great conversation. 

We briefly touched on my anxiety. I even lightheartedly made a joke about choosing whether to have a bagel or panic attack and I seriously don‚Äôt know how this didn‚Äôt kill the conversation. I wish I could remember what he said afterwards or how the conversation kept flowing. Somehow we ended up talking about a bunch of things. It wasn‚Äôt until the end of the conversation that I realized, my panic attack was gone. All the symptoms of my attack were gone as well (I don‚Äôt want to list them and trigger someone).

Not saying for people to try this at all, I‚Äôm just happy I overcame a panic attack and wanted to share this excitement with somebody.

To hear laughs behind

That make me cry ahead

For wanting her to leave

I need her to stay

She's all I've ever known

I must learn to love her

She's trying to protect me

I‚Äôve been having a panic attack since. I just went to talk to her to tell her I needed to leave and she started right back at yelling. 

So I snapped and told her that this was an unacceptable way to speak to employees, that I was leaving and I might be back on Monday if I want to continue being verbally abused.

915,a66bo9,False,Share Your Victories,118,A dumb (but useful!) little anxiety trick.,Anxiety,"Tl;dr I have a method for remembering that I did something, so I won‚Äôt be worrying all day about whether or not I did it, and worrying about the consequences of forgetting to have done it.


Ok so sometimes before work I use my hair straightener. I‚Äôm usually in a rush and have to unplug it before I go on my way, of course. But sometimes more often than not I‚Äôd be at work freaking out that I *forgot* to unplug it, freaking out that my house was currently burnt to bits, a pile of ash and debris on my lawn.

So I end up texting my mother (who I live with) asking her to please check that I unplugged it. The thing is, more often than not, I did. In fact I almost always do, and if I don‚Äôt, *it shuts off automatically anyway*. Yet I still find myself at work stricken with anxiety, wondering if I unplugged my hair straightener.

It‚Äôs an outlandish thing to be so worried about, considering I usually unplug it and it shuts off itself anyway, but my google search is still filled with ‚Äúchances of my house burning down from hair straightener‚Äù ‚Äúhow long do automatic shut-off hair straighteners stay on‚Äù ‚Äúhair straightener fire‚Äù... it‚Äôs not good.

Then recently I decided I needed something to remind me, concretely, that I did unplug it in the mornings when I do. So this is going to sound kind of silly or stupid, but now in the mornings when I unplug it I say, out loud, ‚ÄúI am unplugging my hair straightener‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know why it works. Maybe because I say it out loud and hear it back to me and that reassures me. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a strange action (saying what you‚Äôre doing out loud to nobody) that makes me remember that I did it. I have no idea, but once I started doing this I no longer doubt whether I unplugged my hair straightener, the memory sticks in my mind and I can relax.

So I thought I would inform the people on r/anxiety about it to see if they do anything similar, or could maybe benefit from this. Perhaps this would fall under more of an OCD thing but I‚Äôve only ever been prescribed with anxiety so I‚Äôm not sure that would apply.

919,acj0id,False,None,45,"Your feelings are uncomfortable, but they are not dangerous.",Anxiety,"You have a choice when it comes to your feelings. Your body is releasing stress hormones because it thinks you are in danger because you have trained it to think it is in imminent danger. 

I know, because I trained my mind and body to do the same thing.

Accept your feelings for what they are: physical sensations sent by your brain to bluff you because it doesn‚Äôt know any better.

Choose which thoughts you follow. When the negative thoughts come, let them come but just don‚Äôt follow them because they too are a bluff. A pattern you have fallen into.

If you want something to remind yourself that it‚Äôs a bluff, like a prescribed emergency medication or a recording or a mantra or whatever, use it, but accept your feelings and choose your thoughts. You have that power, it‚Äôs just buried under anxious nerves.


Full disclosure, I‚Äôve always been anxious as long as I remember. I‚Äôve been medicated for about 7 years now but have never attended therapy (working on it, American healthcare and all that). Recently I have had more panic attacks than ever before, or at least that I‚Äôm aware of (looking back I may have chalked some up to being high or drunk as a misguided youth).

But this last time I just happened upon the work of Clair Weekes by way of youtuber Wonderbro.

I don‚Äôt mean to say that you don‚Äôt need medication or therapy. That‚Äôs not what this is about. This is about the reality that those things can bring you to if you let them.

I had a panic attack one week ago. It was bad, I vomited. And like the previous attacks, every day since I have woken up only to have a feeling of dread and tension in my arms wash over me. But I am learning to accept these feelings for what they are: a bluff.


On top of that, I‚Äôm giving up caffeine and alcohol to help myself heal, I‚Äôm going to hold myself to mindfulness meditation every day using the Oak app recommended by a friend.

I mean well and I hope this comes across the way I mean it.

Healing isn‚Äôt easy or fast but I believe all of us can do it.

922,e7qu46,False,Advice Needed,72,Does anyone here get stuck in loops/Intrusive thoughts?,Anxiety,"It's the best way I know how to describe it honestly. I get really intense intrusive thoughts which range from wanting to drive my car into a ditch so I don't have to go to work tomorrow, or the second my boyfriend leaves my house it's like ""oh my god what if he gets into a car accident and dies and this was the last time I saw his face"". I can never even recognize that I am doing it in the moment but I obsess and make myself physically sick with anxiety over it until something clicks and I'm fine again. Like in one of the examples I mentioned above, the thing that clicks me back to normal would be when my boyfriend calls when he gets to his house. The entire time I am in the intrusive thought though, I feel like I am walking around in circles inside my head until my feet are bleeding and then I keep going. 

I have talked to my therapist about it and she mentioned that it sounded like obsessive compulsive tendencies (but I want to be clear that she did not diagnose me with ocd) but a solution was not really discussed. Currently my diagnosis is General anxiety disorder, dysthymia, and ptsd. 

I am kind of at a loss because the intrusive thoughts are getting worse and affecting a lot of different areas of my life in really negative ways right now. Breathing techniques don't work very well because I get annoyed at myself and it starts a whole new loop of not even being able to do that right. Telling myself something like ""it is out of my control so I shouldn't worry about it"" doesn't even work because, again, I don't ever realize that I am doing it in the moments. I just don't know if there is some kind of preventative thing I could be doing or I don't know if medication would even help with that stuff because I don't understand how medication helps with anxiety and I come from a family who addicted to any and all narcotics so I have been worried to even try them and my therapists stance on that is that she trusts my judgement but I just don't fucking know and I feel so lost.

I wont even go sit in the library or go to the student union at school, i‚Äôll go sit in my car instead (i‚Äôm in my senior year and i‚Äôve been in the student union alone maybe 4x).
If i have to go in public alone i try to do whatever i have to, as fast as i can. Though when i‚Äôm with someone that i‚Äôm comfortable with i don‚Äôt really think about that at all or if i do it‚Äôs very very minimal.

932,9pv2ve,False,Sleep,70,my method for sleeping with anxiety,Anxiety,"It's no joke. This sub lights up like a Christmas tree at night. With some forms of anxiety, trying to fall asleep is the absolute worst. I've been battling it for many years and I think I have found one way that works for me.

Staying busy (mentally) is the best way to keep anxiety at bay so when we stay busy physically, we can manage. At night, the ""busy"" goes away, so our brains start churning. These thoughts lead to physical changes in our bodies that make us feel like total shit and make it hard to sleep.  i.e. increased heart rate, tension grinding, stomach pain...etc. 

We can't control the physical stuff so we have to start with the mental stuff. You have to learn to manage your thoughts. Sounds impossible, right? It's possible with practice. Here is what I do. 

You HAVE to avoid anything personal to you. I imagine a giant house. Imagine entering this house. The first floor is a long hallway full of doors. Behind each door is all the stuff you can think about that has no personal attachment to you. Television shows you watch, movies, word games, number games (stay away from music because it tends to cause memory recall to something personal) 

The trick is to STAY ON THE FIRST FLOOR. 

The second floor is anything personal to you. Friends, family, job, school, tasks, money. All these things can trigger anxiety, regret, stress. If you catch yourself thinking about something on the second floor. Back out immediately. 

The basement is the dark place. All your worst fears. Avoid at all cost. 

As for thoughts that are not personal. You will find tricks that work for you. Some things I do...

Take my favorite movie and put myself in it. I imagine myself in all the situations with all the characters and what I would say with them. Same for favorite tv shows. What would I say to each and every character if I had the chance? 

Word games. I try to come up with every word that is two letters only. I come up with words made from another word. Stupid things like that. 

Eventually, you fall asleep. 

I understand this whole thing sounds ridiculous and crazy but the trick is to not touch on anything personal to you. To control your thoughts so you can control the physical reaction to those thoughts. Try it and let me know if it works for you.

This is not the end. This is a temporary situation. The only way out is through. (That last one, a therapist told me once when I was going through an extremely difficult time with my anxiety and depression.)

Those of us with anxiety know this feeling of sheer terror very well. It feels so familiar with us that at first, we weren't sure whether we need to panic. Then we panicked, because we are professional panickers. We are also professionals at getting through this. We have a unique set of skills!

My two main coping skills right now:

1) Thinking of time in two-week increments. Right now, my focus is on the next two weeks. (In the area of the US where I live, there are, for the most part, two-week closures.) So, okay, we get to the end of March, and we'll see how things look. 

2) Tune out the people who say...""this could go on for months/years/etc..."" ""life as we know it is over..."" These are not healthy thoughts or sentiments, nor are they helpful. People that don't see things through a lens of generalized anxiety disorder DO NOT understand how triggering comments like these are. This is how we anxiety sufferers think on a daily basis, and we know how damaging it can be. Others do not, because they don't know about the spiral of unrealistic fears we can go into any other day of a normal, boring day/week/month/year.

I hope this helps. We are here to lift each other up. Let's not feed into each other's panic - let's keep things positive. It's not unrealistic to say, this too shall pass.

At work yesterday (I'm at a salon) my co-workers were gossiping about some former co-worker of theirs and talking about how much of an attention whore she was and how she's nothing but crazy and drama. Apparently this person is currently asking for money on a go fund me page so that she can get a companion dog. She also says that he would need training to help her with her panic attacks, night terrors, and bringing her medicine to her. I thought to myself, what's the big deal? 

But then they started saying things like ""oh she just wants attention,"" ""everybody has some form of anxiety,"" etc. I piped in and explained that things like panic disorder were a real problem for some people and that it's more than just everyday anxiety. The response I got was ""well we know this girl, she just wants  attention. ""Nobody with actual anxiety would actually tell other people about it."" 

Now I don't even know this person they were talking about. Maybe she does just want attention. But maybe, just maybe, she is desperate at this point and is finally reaching out about her problem. Maybe a go fund me isn't the most practical approach, but it makes me so angry whenever people act like mental health is no big deal or just a way to get attention.

948,ewrwu5,False,Venting,80,My cancer might be back :(,Anxiety,"This is just a venting post because I have no other place to rant.

 I was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and reached remission in 2016. Never dealt with mental health until I was diagnosed with the disease. Right after my remission I would get slightly anxious about every single change about my body, without realizing that cancer affect the body tremendously. My doctor tried to make me seek some consultation regarding my anxiety but I refused. 

Time past by and I was simply living. Never had any worries or issue that would trick my anxiety until last month. I noticed I have been losing some weight. It wasn't a lot, but I still have been losing weight which made me anxious. Weight loss was one of my first symptoms of cancer. My anxiety was spiraling and I just kept losing weight. I investigated my body and my neck of any nodes. I had a node on my right neck when I was diagnosed with cancer. Couldn't find any so my mind settled a little bit and I finally gained about 1 pound. 3 days ago I was randomly touching my neck and I found two swollen lymp node. My anxiety went from 0-100 in a couple of minutes. 

For the past days I have been crying and shaking. I'm almost convinced that my cancer is back. I have an appointment with my doctor next week. I just want to get it over with. I'm hoping and praying that its not cancer, but the chance is really really slim.
Can't even look at my mother's face without thinking that I will probably break her heart soon. She was my main support in all this. I saw how mentally draining it was for her and now we need to do it all over again. 

I have been standing on the scale for about 5 times a day to see if my weight changing. Yesterday while I was going to sleep, I pinched my node so hard out of frustration.

It‚Äôs something that we evolved when we weren‚Äôt experiencing complex emotions. Anxiety is a common feeling for animals but not social anxiety or anything- the anxiety that you‚Äôre about to get hunted or killed or chased. When an animal is nervous about whether or not it‚Äôs about to get hurt, it‚Äôs body gets anxious, and in response, the brain sends signals to make your body release anything and everything in it. So you‚Äôre gonna shit piss and vomit until you‚Äôre light as a feather and can run like the wind from whatever you‚Äôre ‚Äúanxious‚Äù about... unfortunately, humans, since we have all these other things in life to worry about like stress, relationships and just life in general, get anxiety ... and so thus feel ill. In your case, you must be pretty anxious for your body to completely rid itself of everything in it.... and it sucks even more because once you‚Äôre done expelling all of it, there‚Äôs no physical anxiety to even run from!

I have some sort of mental block around so many things. I just choose... not to do them. Even if they're things I really want to do or need to do.

For example, today I woke up and needed to be at work at 7. And I just chose not to go and went back to sleep. I just don't care about the consequences of things until it's too late. I've struggled with this for years and I don't know what to do about it. And I always quit before I can get fired, so I've had like 10 jobs in the last two years. I ask people to hold me accountable, I've tried working from home, in an office, in food service, it happens with hangouts with friends and writing classes I take... I just choose not to do things.

I have a lot of goals and dreams for myself. I want a lot for myself and I love to do a lot of things. But for some reason my love of doing nothing in the moment always overshadows my dreams. I literally envy people who break bones and stuff because they get to be bedridden for a month and have an excuse for just reading and watching TV and sleeping. I love sick days.

Aside from 5 Doctors/psychologists visits, I have not left my house once to go anywhere else. When I went to the doctors, I was driven, and I pulled my hoodie over my eyes. Two weeks ago, I started not even being able to go down to check the mail. 

Friday my psychologist told me it was time to go out. She said I was causing myself to get worse by being scared of the outside world. I get anxiety just from having delivery people come to my door. Just the thought of going for a drive seemed like an impossibility.

Today I woke up anxious. Even after I took my medication, I was on pins and needles. I was dreading every second that went by, knowing I was closer to our(my fiance and mines) 3pm departure time. We chose that time specifically so the restaurant would be nearly empty. At 3 o'clock I started stalling and coming up with reasons why I couldn't go. At 3:45 he pushed me out the door and all but dragged me to the car.

The ride there was scary but I forced myself to just listen to his voice and not hide my eyes. I felt nauseous. When we pulled into the parking lot and He pulled me from the car, he hugged me and told me this will be fun and I am safe and he will protect me. We got inside the thankfully almost empty diner. Our waiter was so nice. He put me at ease a lot. I just chose something without really reading the menu because I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

989,8wjxze,False,Trigger Warning,226,"American politics is REALLY fucking with me, and it's making it hard to be around my family.",Anxiety,"I live in North Carolina.  I went to college, initially, for political science and economics, but about 3/4 of the way through that switched to education and biology because my gut told me to GTFO.

In high school, I took AP history and AP government and politics and fell in love with America's founding principles, the political system's design (and intent), and being able to have spirited, informative debates with my peers.  I was at Barack Obama's inauguration with my AP G&P class, and it was wonderful.  One of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed.

But here's the thing...  I was ultra, ridiculously, lick-Ann-Coulter's-asshole conservative during that time.  I had grown up in a trite Republican household in the rural south with traditional right-wing values and a lot of Jesus.  My grandparents are also very conservative.  Fox News was *always* on.

Things quickly began changing when I moved to Raleigh for college.  More racial and religious diversity, time away from Fox News, I discovered Reddit...  And then some personal things happened, as well.  I started having mood swings regularly, I had my first panic attack, I developed epilepsy, I was frequently in the hospital, I had no money...  I got pregnant and had an abortion.

All of this was very eye-opening.  I learned sympathy and empathy really quickly.  It was easy to be politically conservative when I was pretty much totally ignorant to the realities that most people face every day.  But going through all of that changed my view completely.  Suddenly, I saw why people needed government assistance for food, healthcare, transportation, and housing.  I understood why a woman should be free to make a choice about having an abortion (if that pregnancy didn't kill me due to my epilepsy, the child would have had major defects due to the medications I was on at the time).

NOW, though...  Look at what is going on in the US.  Every time I think shit has hit the fan, someone reaches into the shit-bucket again.  It makes me so anxious.  My healthcare is going to be fucked with, I wouldn't be surprised if ADA got dismantled, women's rights are being stripped away...  Not to mention how racial minorities are being fucked.  I might be getting screwed for being a woman, but at least I'm white...

My parents, especially my father, love *all of this.*  I've been spending a lot of time with them following my hospitalization earlier this year from February-April.  Every time I'm there, if the TV is on, it's on Fox News.  If my dad's around, he won't shut up about how *wonderful* Trump is (without giving any real reasons), he says insanely racist things, talks about how people with disabilities are just exaggerating, etc.  It makes me pissed initially, but then I just become anxious because it's so upsetting to see and hear.  Does he think *I'm* faking it, with my multiple suicide attempts and scar-covered body???

He's even got a signed picture of Trump and Melania up on the refrigerator from during the campaign when he donated to them.  Even if I was still conservative, I would've taken that shit down early last year--and, in retrospect, things were mild at that time.

He asks for my opinions, more than likely, to try to confirm how he feels.  He'll loudly commentate on whatever story Fox has on at the time, blame a minority or liberal for something, then ask what I think.  If I didn't have the political background that I do, I would not know WHAT to say.  However, I know how to play along to shut him up sooner, and that's what I do.  It's never what I believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  I can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.

**TL;DR:  American politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  My Dad *loves* Trump and watches Fox News constantly, even when I'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that I vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.**

*EDIT:  You people who are insulting me and PMing me for expressing how I feel need to get some hobbies.  If anyone would actually like some in-depth information and a timeline regarding my anxiety, look through my post history.  I didn't suddenly get anxious about this particular topic whilst having no anxiety regarding anything else.  I'm not targeting anyone specific with my initial post, I was just trying to talk to some people that I thought would understand.*

*BUT, if you do feel upset by my post, instead of calling me names or sending me threats, maybe you should recognize the fact that you feel anxious for a similar reason despite our differing political beliefs.  Because it's the same feeling.*

No good guilting myself for feeling good (ah the struggle of an anxious mind)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/a8witm/i_spend_a_lot_of_money_on_treat_yourself_days_and/,604,"If you can afford it why not? But you might cause yourself more stress spending nearly 200 a month on something you don‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúhave‚Äù to have if money gets tight. 

If you are making this post just for validation of spending the money then maybe sit down and find cheaper alternatives to stress relief. It really shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with being ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù to have a partner.  ",2018-12-23 17:33:13
999,55z37w,False,None,49,Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab,Anxiety,"Came across news this morning that Hip Hop celebrity Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. He wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned.
Just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety.

Here is the letter: 

""Its been difficult for me to find the words to what Im about to share with you because I feel ashamed. Ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting I‚Äôve been living a lie. It took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something I have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans.
Yesterday I checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges.

I am not at peace. I haven‚Äôt been since you‚Äôve known me. If I didn‚Äôt come here, I wouldve done something to myself. I simply am a damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions everyday of my life. Theres a ragin violent storm inside of my heart at all times. Idk what peace feels like. Idk how to relax. My anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it. I cant make new friends because of it. I dont trust anyone because of it and Im tired of being held back in my life. I deserve to have peace. I deserve to be happy and smiling. Why not me? I guess I give so much of myself to others I forgot that I need to show myself some love too. I think I never really knew how. Im scared, im sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, Im sorry. Its time I fix me. Im nervous but ima get through this.

I wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at Republic and my manager Dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. The music videos, album release date etc. The album is still on the way. Promise. I wanted to square away all the business before I got here so I could focus on my recovery.

If all goes well ill be out in time for Complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.

Love and light to everyone who has love for me and I am sorry if I let anyone down. I really am sorry. Ill be back, stronger, better. Reborn. I feel like shit, I feel so ashamed. Im sorry.

I love you,
