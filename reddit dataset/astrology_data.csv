34,giguah,False,None,323,Venus Retrograde Through the Houses: What You Can Expect.,astrology,"Tomorrow Venus stations retrograde in Gemini. Actually, Venus has been slowing down for a bit now, called a station, meaning her footprint is heavy in the sky. Likely, you've already been acquainted with the pitter pattering of themes you can expect during this period. Venus retrograde corresponds to general themes such as: relationship reviews, rewinds, renewals and reversals--evaluating how you relate to your own self-worth and esteem--retooling what you actually value/need--budgeting, getting serious about finances--hiccups with beauty related tools, industries, purchases and decisions.

**But Venus RX means more when you account for the house it will be drudging stuff up in**. My general take on Venus RX is: detouring into the ugly and resurfacing with a new appreciation of beauty.  Kind of like the plot of Shrek. Where are the ogres in your life? And can you just decide to marry them and live happily ever after in a swamp with your donkey dragon friends? I digress...

This RX will be decidedly less brutal than the 2018 one in Scorpio. Those were some dire, uggo times. Venus in Gemini is peregrine, and to me, far more effervescent. Like a La Croix. Some gross flavors. But mostly ok. The reviews and themes will have more to do with ideas, thoughts, beliefs, etc. Very much juggling many dissonant thoughts and being okay with not settling on a conclusion. This will be a mentally exhausting time for some.

Gemini occupies a house in everyone's chart. Welcome to the circus:

**First House**: a time to reconsider what makes you feel beautiful, to redefine what beauty has to mean and look like. a time of enhanced social awareness (from a distance) and learning how you bring a distinct value to people--but first settling on how you wish to value yourself. being comfortable with your many faces, but also eliminating the faces, the out-grown personalities, that do not suit you anymore

**Second House:** a time to reevaluate how material possessions add beauty, add value, add ease-- or completely distract you from the assets that matter the most. a renewed version of self-care, a hard and honest look at your bank account and closet and cabinets, a purging to make room for new beautiful things to bloom. divine dividends 

**Third House**:  a time to reconsider what needs to be said. holding space for new ideas to take the place of old ones. learning to value your unique perspective, whilst also respecting the perspectives of others. work that neuro plasticity, pave new grooves into your gray matter. a time to stop and smell the roses as you are out and about. rekindling bonds with siblings and teammates.

**Fourth House**: a time to spackle, paint, hang and rearrange. where has the beauty in your home become stagnant, and how can you insert new pathways of inspiration into your halls? retooling your roots, beautifying your sanctuaries, finding Aphrodite in your ancestry. this can be a time to reacquaint yourself with the value a tribe, a home, a family, and a foundation gives you. that's how beauty can blossom.

**Fifth House**: a time to make friends with that blinking cursor on a blank page, the dried paint brush, the stack of half-finished poetry in the corner of your room, and the project that makes your heart sing--but that you've been too afraid to sing along with. retool your relationship with your inner child, that spark in the dark. your authentic self could use some authenticating 

**Sixth House**: a time to throw out ugly habits, dead-end jobs, and the futile and self-deprecating sense of duty and responsibility you hold. time for new rituals. time put your worth and value ahead of the needs of others. you are more than a cog in a machine. you are the machine. an extraordinary one. and an extraordinary one needs all the tonics, tinctures, remedies and herbs. beautiful insides make for a beautiful outside, so celebrate your vitality, and appreciate all that your body does--in sickness and in health

**Seventh House**: a time to throw out ugly people! where are your relationships failing to live up to the happiness, joy, and wonder that you deserve? time for the talks, time to press send on an apology, time to ask for help, time to delete the dating profile and jump into the vulnerability of committed partnership, or time to unwed yourself from the security of singledom and start to mingle your heart out. also a good time to take inventory of the people you've invited into your hopes and dreams, the business affiliates that either help you sink or swim. choose people who bring beauty and warmth into your life. unbreak your heart. time for new patterns.

**Eighth House**: a time to get a handle on your debt, obligations, on your portfolios and investments. where are you over-sharing, where are you under-sharing, where can you give more, and where can you divest? immaterially, your heart, your humanness, your deeply disowned ugliness--they all deserve some TLC. those ogres aren't so scary or ugly when you get to know them. nothing to fear but fear itself. a time for magic and mysticism to inform your path forward.

**Ninth House**: a time to reevaluate your schooling, your education, what you have accepting as TRUTH actually has more to it.  become more nimble with your personal dogma and ideology. challenges to your way of seeing the world don't have to be challenging, but rather, give you a wider array of intellectual and cultural beauty to sample from and enjoy. though not a good time for travel, certainly still a good time to plan. that faraway corner of the world is calling out for you. and that faraway corner of your mind could use a refresh. where are your gurus and mentors failing to inspire you? ditch the old paradigms. there's a yellow brick road with your name on it.

**Tenth House:** a time to reevaluate your career, your place in the world, the value that you bring to the world, and your unique set of talents. where are you asking to be respected yet still bumping up against gatekeepers? where can your creativity be better suited? you are your own boss, and your manager can't manage you. time to step up into a firmer sense of self and confidence. take up space. be loud. this is your world and we are living in it.

**Eleventh House:** a time to reevaluate your social networks, your friend groups, your hopes, accomplishments and your communities at large. unfriend the group think. jettison the crusty cliques. deactivate the profiles. consider where society has perhaps let you down, and recommit to creating environments worthy of the cause that is you. there is beauty to be shared. humanity has cracks but that is where light enters. be the light, even if you need to go dark for now.

**Twelfth House:** a time to reconsider where you self-sabotage, where you isolate, where you needlessly alienate yourself and others. this can be a deeply creative time when you burrow in the right direction, where unconscious gifts lay, where spirituality sparkles, where the undulations of life at large are within your grasp. beautify your alone time, make it work for you. give your mental hardships some love and tenderness. play around with the unknown, remold your trauma and psychic entanglements, find the beauty in necessary endings and loss. for that is how you begin again.

124,d4cvd2,False,None,83,Alternative animal symbols for the Zodiac signs.,astrology,"Aries- Wild Boar- Historically associated with the Greek god Ares (Mars to the Romans). The boar has long symbolised courage, ferocity and conflict as well as confronting life‚Äôs challenges and never retreating. Boars are frequently associated with warriors and many of the Norse berserkers channeled boars in battle. The fierce independent spirit of Aries is unrivalled. ¬†

Taurus- Elephant. Gentle giants. Endurance, stability, loyalty, protection and abundance are associated with elephants, who are also matriarchal animals, fitting for a sign ruled by Venus and the exaltation of the Moon. Elephants form strong loving bonds with each other and have a responsibility over the natural world (Taurus connection to nature) due to their size.¬†They are the stewards of the Earth. 

Gemini- Parrot- Bright, quick, colourful birds. They are experts at mimicking sounds, often to comedic effect, and are highly social. They are winged messengers. They have strong associations with language, clarity, intellect, whimsy, playfulness and the power of words in speaking the truth. Above all they are fun, lively and witty. (Another good symbol for Gemini is the trickster fox- but I ultimately felt a bird was more appropriate.)¬†

Cancer- Sea Turtle- The ancient Babylonian symbol for Cancer. Soft, gentle, tender animals with a hard protective shell (home on it‚Äôs back) and the ability to move between water and land. Emotional strength is their gift as well as true understanding and guardianship. In many cultures turtles are symbols of motherhood, creation, fertility and longevity, and have long been associated with the Moon as hatchlings use the moonlight to find their way off the beach and make their way to the ocean.¬†

Leo- Peacock- Regal, proud, ostentatious. The peacock is a well known symbol of royalty, the most spectacular of birds. Glory, confidence, vibrancy, expression and nobility come under it‚Äôs associations, as well as integrity. Like Leo‚Äôs you can‚Äôt take your eyes of a peacock, who uses its tail feathers to impress and draw attention. In the ancient world peacock feathers were frequently engraved onto the thrones of royalty.¬†

Virgo- Cat- Virgo is strongly associated with domesticated animals but the cat is the most Virgoan to me. Cats are astute, observant, independent, self-contained, selective, solitary and watchful. They meticulously groom and clean themselves and their owners can feel like they hate them (Virgo's resting bitch face). They can be downright mean but they secretly care underneath it all and feel the need to assist when others don‚Äôt meet their standards (cats hunting mice for their incompetent owners).¬†

Libra- Swan- A bird that is the symbol of love, grace, harmony and beauty. Swans are universally known for their elegance (they are evoked often in ballet- which is ruled by Venus/Libra) and their devotion to each other as swan couples mate for life. Their curved necks come together to create a love heart, cementing them as a symbol of romance, union, partnership and reconciliation. In mythology the swan was attributed to Aphrodite/ Venus.¬†

Scorpio- Serpent- An ancient symbol for Scorpio, and one I actually think fits better than the Scorpion. A much maligned and feared creature, they are venomous and capable of shedding their old skins. Since ancient times this has led to serpents being associated with death, rebirth, transformation and the purging and elimination of the old. Poised and coiled they conserve their energy for the fatal strike. The kundalini is a strong connection between these two as well as the fact that many species of serpent are aquatic- fitting for a water sign.¬†

Sagittarius- Wild Horse- This one is slightly cheating as Sagittarius is already symbolised by a half-horse centaur, however no animal comes close to representing Sagittarius better than the wild horse. Freedom, movement, exploration, journeys, nobility and victory. The wild horse lives without limitation or restraint, roaming under vast skies, much like Sagittarius. They refuse to be tamed.¬†

Capricorn- Crocodile- The animal associated with Capricorn in Vedic astrology, the crocodile is ancient, hard, stern, patient, powerful, resilient and conserving of it‚Äôs energy and resources. Wisdom that comes with time is attributed to crocodiles along with Saturn, Capricorns ruler. The crocodile is cold blooded, armoured and intimidating, a creature to be respected and feared. Ultimately they are built to outlast all others.¬†

Aquarius- Human Being- Many people like to forget that we are animals, but we are, and the human is the only animal that can accurately represent Aquarius- the sign of humanity. Humans are noted for our intellect, inventiveness, development of technologies and our many complex social behaviours. We are the animals with the greatest vision for the future.¬†

Pisces- Whale- The peaceful leviathans of the oceans, symbolising solitude, deep wisdom, compassion and the mysteries of consciousness which we cannot fathom. Whales are symbolically sensitive to all ‚Äúwaters"" and open to embracing the unknown, surrendering to higher powers. Whales are shy and have an elusive magic to them, but when seen they are awe-inspiring. The whale is a true, soulful representative of the vastness of the ocean and of Pisces.¬†

142,g5ropu,False,None,123,The Cancer Archetype- Feminine Authority and a Mother's Wisdom,astrology,"Cancer is a sign that has suffered more from the historical subjugation of women than any other sign. It's a feminine sign- strike one. It's an emotive water sign- strike two. It's ruled by the Moon, the planet of women and motherhood- strike three. The same stereotypes that were designed to break down women and put them in their place are the same stereotypes pushed onto Cancer in astrology circles today- weak, histrionic, irrational, unstable, not in control of their emotions. It seems Cancer has been pegged as the weepy nurturer with not much else to offer, a weakening influence on a chart. That mindset speaks more to societies view on femininity than it does to the sign of Cancer. It seems to me Cancer is in need of a re-framing. 

The cardinal signs offer different brands of leadership. The forceful military command of Aries. The fair and democratic leadership of Libra. The firm and responsible hand of patriarchal Capricorn. And finally Cancer- the matriarch, the feminine authority (for whatever reason I'm picturing a circle of women on a beach beneath the Moon, tapping into their feminine power). Supportive leadership, emotionally driven leadership. Leadership that sustains and nurtures those that it directs and governs. Leadership that connects and instills a deep sense of belonging. This is the nature of Cancer and its ruler the Moon, the Queen of the heavens, beloved of her subjects. Cancer is the life-giving properties of water- water that is nourishing, enriching, life-affirming- water that rushes forth to envelop and cause everything that it touches to flourish. It is where mother ocean surges forth to meet land creating one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth, a place where life thrives. It is the creative nexus of the womb and the birth of a child into the world at the breaking of the waters- a vulnerable but powerful moment when emotions are heightened and hearts are open. This is not weakness, this is strength. To walk through the world open and receptive is potent and remarkable. To take something so vulnerable and nurture it to full strength is a feat. 

And this is why Jupiter is exalted in Cancer. There is nothing Jupiter cannot accomplish in the life-giving summer solstice sign of Cancer, where creative life force is in absolute *abundance*. It's also fair to say that for the majority of people the person that guides them, advises them, offers wisdom and support is their mother. Good mothers are the counsellors, gurus and guardians of all that they support. This is a vital and inherent (yet overlooked) quality of Cancer energy. And so Jupiter *loves* it, because here he has the broadest reach- you may not open up to a priest- but you will open up to your mother. And so we see the protective, guiding hand of the matriarch. Guardianship. Feminine wisdom and intuition. Emotional attunement and responsiveness. Cancer is the waves and the tides of the ocean, ebbing and flowing, pushing and pulling; ever fluctuating like the waxing and waning of the Moon. But the waves and tides are not always gentle, they can turn forceful as the mother who defends her child, as the matriarch who defends her community, as the Moon goddesses of old who were both tender and nurturing but fierce. And so Cancer shields those who need them. They take something small and vulnerable and nurture it to the point it can be delivered into the world. This could be a person, it could be an idea, a business, a creative project- all nurtured and grown, infused with genuine emotion and birthed into the world. The creative potential of Cancer is only rivalled by the other luminary sign, Leo. Together they light the world. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading. I hope you see how the lack of respect Cancer receives in modern astrology is unjust and is a legacy of the subjugation of the feminine. I hope this also brought some validation to people with Cancer placements who feel overlooked or poorly represented. We are not told that we are powerful, we are not told we are charismatic, we are not told that we are intelligent, we are not told that we have much to offer beyond being of service to others. So it's often a long road to learning to love our Cancer placements. I'm there now, I see how special and powerful it is, and hopefully this has helped you to do the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/g5ropu/the_cancer_archetype_feminine_authority_and_a/,478,"Wish my NN, Mercury and Sun were in Capricorn instead Cancer.

211,ef5tdg,False,None,13,7 Basic Astrological Rules,astrology,"Taken from Steven Forrest‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Inner Sky‚Äô (1984):

‚ÄúAstrological symbols are neutral. There are no good ones, no bad ones.

Individuals are responsible for the way they embody their birthcharts.

No astrologer can determine a person‚Äôs level of response to his birthchart from that birthchart alone.

The birthchart is a blueprint for the happiest, most fulfilling, most spiritual creative path of growth available to the individual.

All deviations from the ideal growth pattern symbolised by the birthchart are unstable states, usually accompanied by a sense of aimlessness, emptiness, and anxiety.

Astrology recognises only two absolutes: the irreducible mystery of life , and the uniqueness of each individuals viewpoint on that mystery. 

Astrology suffers when wedded too closely to any philosophy or religion. Nothing in the system matters except the intensification of a person‚Äôs self awareness. 

‚Äî-Growth. Change. Evolution. That is the heart of astrology‚Äî-‚Äú

I kind of find that the absolute most common stereotype for Sag is that they‚Äôre chronic travelers, which I find distracts from the other complex elements of the personality.  

I think Sag is a restless sign that likes variety, but I wouldn‚Äôt limit that manifestation to the parameters of traveling specifically.

Sure, it depends on which house the placement is in and how it‚Äôs aspected but I feel like the ‚ÄúSag loves to travel‚Äù is such a cop out sometimes.  It feels like it‚Äôs the only notable thing people can think of to associate with the entire sign, when in my experience with the Sag people I know, it‚Äôs not even one of the top predominant qualities I associate with any of them.

I think all signs have this for sure (like cancers being sensitive etc), but I just feel so bored when I see people immediately jump to the travel association because it feels a little uninformed and also like a big miss in terms of actual Sag traits.

251,ecnb1n,False,None,51,"12 Signs, 12 Murderers & What May Have Compelled Them to Kill (Part 1)",astrology,"*(TRIGGER WARNING: THE EVENTS TALKED ABOUT BELOW ARE EXTREMELY DARK AND DISTURBING.

You‚Äôve seen the meme going around. The one that tallies up infamous serial killers and their Sun signs. The result? A heap of mutable signs. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. I‚Äôm tired of the slander! Jokes aside, it does seem to perpetuate harmful stereotypes, especially for Gemini and Sagittarius (or Sagiterrorist as Twitter says---yikes) ,that there is something inherently dubious, untrustworthy or sinister about these signs. So here is a brief examination of all 12 signs, the infamous killers who belong to them, and the planetary conditions that can compel heinous acts. That‚Äôs right, murdering is equal-opportunity and doesn‚Äôt discriminate based on sign. Leggo!

**Aries:** Donald Harvey, born 4/15/1952. Killed 37-57 people while working as an orderly. Method: mostly poison. RX Mars in Scorpio square Pluto in Leo. Mars in the 8th, Pluto in the 5th. Poison, a rather passive way of killing someone, can belong to a RX Mars in Scorpio, and the perverse pleasure from such acts can belong to Pluto in the 5th. ASC ruled by this Mars, out of aspect to the ASC‚Äîsuggesting a hidden, unwieldy martial nature. Tense aspects between Mars and Pluto can manifest‚Ä¶darkly. He also had Neptune opposite his Sun-Jupiter conjunction in the 1st. Neptune can destabilize the ego, create low self esteem, and produce disturbing fantasies, especially here with a sextile to Pluto. Uranus in the 4th in Cancer is the apex of a T-square, with the opposition between his Sun-Jupiter and Neptune, both of which square Uranus. Acting out in erratic and disturbing ways whilst taking care of people in a place they call home (Uranus-Cancer-4th). Harvey said he killed out of empathy, wanting to end others‚Äô suffering, or out of anger. Jupiter conj Sun in the 1st in Aries can create a hot-head whose anger gets out of order (Jupiter expands)  very fast. Harvey also had tense aspects from his Venus to his Moon and from his Venus and Mercury to Saturn. Unloved, a hardened love, loss of confidence. Moon in detriment in Capricorn.

**Taurus:** Albert Fish, born 5/19/1870. Killed 3, confirmed. A suspected 9-100 others. Method: variable, but sexual in nature. No time of birth and therefore no rising sign. Mars conjunct Pluto in Taurus. So we are sensing a Mars-Pluto theme. In the fleshy sign of Taurus, this conjunction unfortunately manifested as a fascination with genitals and sexual mutilation. Mars can be our sex drive, and Taurus is a carnal and physical sign, concerned with the body and physical pleasures. Pluto adds the darkness and obsession. Fish also mutilated himself, sticking several needles into his, uh, pelvic region. Mars in Taurus cuts into the flesh. Fish said that he felt God was compelling him to torture children. His Capricorn Moon was opposite his Uranus in Cancer, disturbed rationale on the idea of taking care of children. Here, Venus was also square the Moon, conjunct Neptune, and square Uranus. His prevailing sense of value and love was disillusioned by Neptune (feeling directed by God, a higher force) and completely abnormal (Venus sq Uranus). He was apparently nicknamed *The Moon Maniac* because he struck at night. Weirdly enough, the Moon exalts in Taurus. Not astrologically relevant but ironic.

**Gemini:** I feel like I should skip this re: the meme alluded to above. So many to choose from‚Ä¶ 

Uh‚ÄîDavid, ‚ÄúSon of Sam‚Äù Berkowitz, born 6/1/1953. Killed 6. Method: stabbing and shooting. I know you‚Äôre wondering by now: what are Mars and Pluto doing in his chart? Well, they‚Äôre in a softer sextile, Mars in Gemini and Pluto in Leo. But Mars is conjunct Mercury in the 8th and trine Neptune in Libra in his 12th. He famously suggested that he was under the influence of a demon dog while at the time of the murders, feeling compelled to carry out these terrible acts because of this voice in his head. This is the seamless conversation of Mars (aggression) Mercury (your mental processing) and Neptune. He made up a fantastical lie, probably to be declared mentally incompetent. The 8th and 12th houses are also a fitting arena for stories of demons, possession, killing and other otherworldly phenomena. Berkowitz enjoyed the publicity he got from his crimes, perfect for an 8th house Gemini stellium and for a Leo MC. He also enjoyed writing letters to the police, taunting them. Gemini loves a cat and mouse game. Sadly, this was a disgusting one. He mostly victimized women, perhaps owing to a fallen Venus in Aries opposite his ascendant, Neptune and Saturn. This is also the 3rd serial killer in a row to have Moon square Venus, an infelt tension between his emotional gratification and the principle of femininity. 

**Cancer:** Genene Jones, born 7/13/1950. Killed 2. A suspected 60 others. Method: poison. No birth time. Jones was a nurse in the pediatric unit of a hospital. And so yes, all of her victims were infants and children, fitting for a Cancer Sun. She also had her Moon, Mercury and Uranus in Cancer, with Uranus in a tight conjunction to her Moon. This goes without saying by now but pretty erratic emotional nature. Mars was conj Neptune in beauty-loving Libra, and Jones worked for a time as a beautician before becoming a nurse. This combination later ended up producing a woman who murdered (Mars) but injecting lethal amounts of drugs (Neptune) into her patients. 

**Leo:** Luka Magnotta, born 7/24/1982. Killed 1 human, several animals. Method: suffocation, decapitation, severing and stabbing. No birth time. Subject of the new Netflix docu-series: *Don‚Äôt Fuck With Cats: Hunting An Internet Killer.* Magnotta had Sun conjunct Mercury in attention-seeking Leo. He tried out for many reality shows, was a porn actor, and portrayed his life online as a jet-setting model and socialite. He had several fan pages on Facebook, with almost all the comments praising how beautiful he was. It later surfaced that *he* created all these fan pages, wrote all the comments, and doctored images with his face on other people‚Äôs bodies to give the illusion of a glamourous life (His Sun-Mercury conjunction is square boastful Jupiter). His Moon was in shy, calculated and sometimes cold Virgo, square Neptune, embedding within his emotional life a perverse kind of dreaming and wanting. His emotional nature was at odds with his Leo Sun, setting the ground for a person who needed to find attention in a less obvious way. Oh and yes, here he had a Mars-Pluto-Saturn conjunction in relationship oriented Libra, sextile his Neptune in Sagittarius. Mars and Pluto square his Sun‚Äîa magnetic, forceful, lustful, and aggressive personality, an ego bent on control and perverse desire. All 3 malefics in Libra show that relationships would never be easy for him, owing also to his Virgo Moon, which can view emotional satisfaction as a struggle. Magnotta uploaded videos on YouTube of him murdering kittens, never showing his face (Virgo). This is how he ended up filling the dark desire of his Leo Sun: he got A LOT of attention. Later on, he also uploaded a video of him killing a Chinese man studying abroad in Canada. He had Uranus trine his Sun-Mercury conjunction in Leo. That he used the Internet to display the attention-seeking needs of his Leo Sun is no surprise.  

**Virgo:** Paul Bernardo, born 8/27/1964. Killed 4. Raped 13. Bernardo was known as *The School Girl Killer* which off the bat is an eerie coincidence for a Virgo Sun and Rising. If there is anything that conjures up the innocence and purity known (kind of stereotypically) for Virgo, it is the archetype of the school-girl. He has Mars exactly conjunct Venus in Cancer, and trine Neptune in Scorpio. His first rape was against his sister in law and aided by his wife. So, grossly, it was a family affair, the domain of Cancer. Neptune brought in the element of drugs and alcohol‚ÄîBernardo drugged his wife‚Äôs (Karla) little sister with rum and sleeping pills, and took advantage of her when she passed out. Mars conjunct Venus can indicate violence against women. But strangely, in Bernardo‚Äôs case, it also represented that he carried out many of his crimes with his wife by his side. This theme continued‚Äîwhere Karla would bait the victim and drug them, and Bernardo would assault them. Bernardo‚Äôs Mercury, Pluto and Uranus were involved in a tight conjunction in Virgo in the 1st, opposite Saturn in Pisces in his 7th. His identity to the world and within relationships was wrought with control, obsession, restriction, and darkness. He frequently boasted about his sexual prowess, experience and preferences‚Äîa signpost of compulsive Pluto defining the personality from the 1st. His wife Karla (Taurus) had the same Mars conjunct Venus aspect in her chart and Pluto conjunct Bernardo‚Äôs ascendant, fueling his sexual appetite. Bernardo‚Äôs Mars conjunct Venus fell in Karla‚Äôs 7th house of relationship. They also both had Moon in Aries conjunct, solidifying the sordid theme of Mars in both of their charts. This is the story of a fated relationship intertwined with the ominous themes of death, sexual gratification and predation.

*Phew.* I need a break. I need to drink water and dance to happy music. It is late and writing this is hard on my heart. But what do you think? Should I continue with the last 6 signs?

252,ce1eb6,False,Horoscope,52,I FINALLY painted a new Gemini witch. My last one wasn‚Äôt the nicest so really wanted to redo her ‚ôäÔ∏è,astrology,,https://i.redd.it/4ibus2muqpa31.jpg,348,"Wow! Where to begin? You have a very skewed view of the Gemini archetype. Or you really don't know your Gemini friends from the inside to know how to portray them. But let's begin from the outside.

1. Maiden of THICCNESS, the monstrous BITCH ASS! It's one thing to draw a friend it's another to basterdize the whole archetype. So thicc, much WOW. Sure the Gemini form the comment section will applaud, because they may got stuck with that unholy body figure (for a Gemini), but in reality their bodies (by average Gemini archetype and you are drawing the archetype and not a friend I hope) are slim and tend to be shorter. This ""Barbarisa"" you've drawn is exactly the opposite. The gemini sign on the leg is not enough proof. That type of body structure seems more like Sagittarius, but the face...

2. THE FACE, AAAAAGH! Do you know the name Peter Pan? Imagine that face and expression on a woman. Mopeyness and Gemini don't go together. The type of mopey face you've brought to ""life"" is like of somone just cried and learned how to live without drying their tears off... like ever. That's the face of a Gemini? Mhm. Plump lips, stubby nose that also has red tip that is very dull. Also the cow look in the eyes? What is this!? **Gemini - sharp features or smaller or wild and childish looking. Gemini and smiles are synonyms if you didn't know.** Face looks too much like Cancer or some mopey water sadness which is not what Gemini is about. Or if it is it would be one of many faces that don't persist for too long. Also the whole dress looks very close to the body - restricting in a way. That is not the typical Gemini free flow style. While the hair and diadem looks out of place pompous and vey, VERY long and deep blue - again vey Pisces like. Gemini has shorter hair as it's a sign that is much more surer (on the outside) of itself. Expect a Gemini to do her hair in a way that signifies her care free attitude.

3. What's with the Moon... **again**? Are you the one that drew the Aquarius with Moon in the background **again** and made it look like Pisces? If that is you I suggest swapping the Moon (I know it's more artsy looking than the rest of the planets) with the actual ruling planet of the sign. Also drop the persisting blue melancholic colors when the sign is not Cancer, Pisces or Scorpio.

4. Book of Crystals? - Book of books is the correct name while not being at home, but ouside while speaking with many other people with a smile on the face.

Suggested real Gemini to make comparissons - Gwen Stefani, Marilyn Monroe, Kylie Minogue, Angelina Jolie.

Just swap the hair color to yellow/orange, put a smile on the face and change colors to more vibrant ones and it goes from mopey sadnes (which is not Gemini) to Sagittarius.

If you've read all of this take it with a grain of salt as it was a pleasure to troll you. ;)

In any case the Gemini from the drawing needs more Tricksteryness in it. :) ",2019-07-16 19:00:54

What do you appreciate about Taureans?,astrology,"Taurus season started yesterday, and so I wanted to make a post dedicated to  appreciating Taurus since I feel like Taurus is never really talked about and is very underrated. I find that I come across a lot of Taureans (probably cause I‚Äôm a Taurus descendant) and almost all of them I meet I find them to be nothing short of amazing. I believe that Taurus is the kindest and loyalest sign out of the zodiac, and they‚Äôre very caring as well. Taurus offers a stable support system that you can certainly rely on, they always offer a hand to those they care about. They‚Äôre great at advice, and can help you see the beauty in life‚Äôs most difficult situations. They will always be there to encourage you to keep pushing forward even when your life seems to be getting off track, and they do this in a very gentle, caring and nurturing way. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to be friends with them you‚Äôll know that they offer a ride or die type friendship, and they will always be thoughtful of you. You will also be aware that the stereotype of them being boring is far from true, they will surely have you entertained even in the most mundane situations. They are as loyal as they come and will not only fend for you in your presence but in your absence as well. They offer genuineness, stability, loyalty and beauty to your life and I very much appreciate all the Taureans I‚Äôve had the pleasure to befriend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/g4yiof/happy_taurus_season_what_do_you_appreciate_about/,344,"Taurus hurt me and lie and steal and cheat.

What do you appreciate about Gemini‚Äôs?,astrology,"(Please don‚Äôt post hateful things in the comments, there‚Äôs plenty of other posts you can do that on but this is an appreciation post). The sun just entered Gemini and so I wanted to post an appreciation post for Gemini‚Äôs since they‚Äôre one of the unappreciated signs. I‚Äôm surrounded by a lot of Gemini energy (whether it be someone‚Äôs sun, moon or any other personal planet‚Äôs sign) in my life and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. One of my favorite things about Gemini‚Äôs is they‚Äôre constantly expanding my interests since they‚Äôre interested in various things and give great recommendations for topics they‚Äôd think I‚Äôd find interesting. They‚Äôre also amazing conversationalist, the longest conversation I‚Äôve ever had was with my Gemini best friend where we talked 8 hours straight, and not even for a second during those 8 hours did I get bored. They‚Äôre very entertaining, interesting and just all around fun people to surround yourself with. As an Aquarius I often feel misunderstood but Gemini placements are one of the only signs who I feel really understands (or at least attempts to understand) and accepts me. Gemini‚Äôs are very open to new ideas and perspectives so they‚Äôre not one to be judgmental if you express your true unfiltered self to them. They respect individuality and give others freedom to be who they truly are. They‚Äôre also very adaptable and go with the flow and won‚Äôt be shaken if unexpected changes occur and can adjust well to them. They‚Äôre down for anything life has to offer and they‚Äôre great at coming up with amazing new adventures that the 2 of you can experience together. Gemini also makes everyone feel welcome by starting conversations with anyone, even if they don‚Äôt hang out with the same crowd as them. For example when I was in elementary school I had barely any friends, but there was a Gemini girl who was popular who would always converse with me and make me feel included whenever she was with me. I also can‚Äôt forget to mention how creative and intellectual Gemini‚Äôs are, they spread knowledge and inspire others creatively all at once. Last but certainly not least is there humor, their witty comments are shockingly hilarious and they‚Äôre definitely one of the most comedic signs there is.

Edit: Someone pointed out 10th and 11th were the same. That's my error on transferring the notes, not sure what happened. Updated the 11th house.

Note: A lot of you are scrutinising the 'house=sign=planets'. I don't think 'corresponding' or 'associated' are words which indicate a meaning of equating one thing or another. Rather, it's a look at patterns. Astrology is a practice of patterns. Personally, I don't think Forrest is equating house to sign to planet, he's merely associating the patterns that lie between the three. Take the 1st house as an example, being associated to Aries. Whilst the 1st House at first glance doesn't seem to have anything to do with Aries, it does have something to do with our decisiveness, action-taking ability and how we assert ourselves in the world. Aries likes doing that, being decisive, taking action and asserting oneself in the world. It's not extraordinary to associate these patterns between sign house and planet, but by no means does that mean any sort of equation!

294,cjowne,False,None,78,What Each Planet Does to Your Sun,astrology,"Some things before I start: 

Not only does the Sun represent your personality, but it also represents father figures, fatherhood, masculinity, physical and emotional health and vitality, physical appearance to a degree, and your creativity (or lack thereof.)

Mercury and Venus can only conjunct the Sun. It can‚Äôt be sextile, trine, square, or opposite. 

Semi sextiles can be soft aspects and semi squares can be hard. They‚Äôre just a little less powerful.

The influence of the sun and the respective planets aspecting it is a factor when describing the aspects between them. If your Sun isn‚Äôt that powerful, and your moon isn‚Äôt either, then the description for the Sun-Moon native is probably not going to be accurate.

With that being said, in most cases, the Sun is easily the most influential planet in astrology when it comes to your innate personality. If you‚Äôre not at least a little like your Sun sign, you are a rare case.

Conjunctions can either be an easy aspect or a hard aspect because they are the purest blend of both planets. They take in both the negative and the positive traits of both planets and mix them together. It‚Äôs up to the native to work hard on themselves and make it a soft aspect. 

While most of us express our Sun sign‚Äôs traits to a certain extent, the men have an easier time doing it, along with their Mars sign‚Äôs traits. Women have an easier time expressing their Moon and Venus signs.

I like to add my opinions here and there to make it more fun to write for me so don‚Äôt take it personally if you don‚Äôt like what I say. 
....‚Ä¶....................................................................................

Sun-Moon adds a lot of emotions to your personality. Soft aspects (trine, sextile, potentially conjunctions) make you more in touch with your emotions, whereas Hard aspects (square, opposition, potentially conjunction) make you hate and try, but fail miserably, to reject these emotions, resulting in more negative emotions. The good aspects can also mean a good relationship between the parents, while the bad aspects mean there could be a rocky relationship. Sun-Moon natives‚Äô health could be dependent on their moods. The female native could possibly be seen as somewhat fatherly because they can express their moon sign a lot more easily than other women without this aspect, making them seem more initiating. The male native can have some motherly traits. Sun-Moon natives are family-oriented. They love their Moms more than anyone else. The father figure was possibly a Cancer or had some of the Moon‚Äôs influence in his chart. The father figure was perhaps the native‚Äôs mother too. The father figure nurtured the native and attended to the natives feelings. The father figure probably stayed at home and cooked and cleaned. 

Sun conjunct Mercury adds some intellect to the personality. these natives are expressive, clear thinker-types who are amazing story tellers. They love to talk. Perhaps a bit too much. They also like to study  and make good critics. The physical health is average, but they oddly have a lot of mental energy. They have some anxiety. The body has the jitters. They need their brain stimulated constantly. The father figure might‚Äôve been a Gemini or Virgo, or had a lot of Mercury‚Äôs influence in their chart. The father figure probably talked to the native a lot and played mentally stimulating games with the native like chess. The semi sextiles can easily harness their energy and use it for more productive means. 

Sun-Venus beautifies the native in multiple ways. No matter the aspect, these natives have a certain level of elegance to them. The natives with the soft aspects are charming, friendly, quietly confident and content with themselves. The men are in touch with their feminine side. In some cases, the men could be openly gay. The women could be girly girls. The hard aspects make the native unaware or insecure of their beauty. They can be charming on the outside, but on the inside they could be struggling with themselves. They probably do a lot just to fit in, compromising themselves in the process. Hard aspect or soft though, Sun-Venus natives can be shallow, gossipy, lazy, and vain. They can be very good looking and/or have a great fashion sense. They like being in relationships. They don‚Äôt like to argue. The health is good and they‚Äôll probably remain young-looking in later years. They might workout to enhance their looks. The father-figure was a Libra/Taurus or had a lot of Venus‚Äô influence in his chart. The father-figure could‚Äôve been feminine or could‚Äôve had a good fashion sense. The father figure might‚Äôve been rich or bought nice things. The father figure probably treated the native more like a friend than a child. 

Sun-Mars makes the native more virile, masculine, and passionate. Since the Sun already rules masculinity and vitality, when it blends with Mars, the planet of raw masculinity and testosterone, it makes a VERY powerful combo and one of my favorites. Along with that, Mars also rules vitality and energy, so these natives are all over the place, regardless of whether they have a hard or soft aspect. Soft aspects, however, give the native focus and that aggression and energy is spent on trying to win at life. However, they still are confrontational and will not let anything stand in their way when it comes to doing what they want to do. People like them because they let their actions speak for themselves. They don‚Äôt need to prove anything to anyone because they know they‚Äôre awesome. They‚Äôre just more confident than the natives with hard aspects. Those natives are more insecure with themselves and their ambitions align with proving people wrong instead of trying to succeed for themselves. They get into petty fights and probably have anger issues. They won‚Äôt ever let anyone win at ANY argument, and in doing so, they push people away from them as a result. Sun-Mars natives are ambitious, confrontational, outspoken, and individualistic. They‚Äôre also rebellious, violent, anti social, selfish, and just plain rude. Interestingly, in some cases, these people have a childlike charm to them due to how oblivious they can be to other people and social constructs. They‚Äôre very self-oriented, like a baby. People either love them or hate them. These natives are very healthy, and most likely muscular. They NEED to workout because of all of that natural energy they have. The men are of the most masculine natives in astrology. (Sun-Saturn and Sun-Pluto natives are up there too) Macho men in every sense and they probably revere the idea of them being feminine. The women are Tom boys who love to hang out with guys too. Could be lesbian and have a muscular body. The father figure was an Aries/Scorpio or have heavy Mars energy in their chart. The father figure probably shouted a lot which had either a positive or negative effect on the native. The father figure was probably into working out a lot and loved sports and cars. The father figure was either selfish or tried to get too involved with the native‚Äôs life.  The father figure acted childish at times. The father figure was probably in the military.

Sun-Jupiter is also a very powerful blend of planets AND one of my favorites as well. These people are the funniest bunch in the zodiac. The Sun rules creativity and individuality, Jupiter rules morality and principles amongst other things. What you get is a person who can be honest in the most creative way. This blend makes you a very lucky, fortunate person who can be extremely optimistic. With the soft aspects, it‚Äôs like blessings keep falling on your lap without you really doing anything. So naturally, you‚Äôre very optimistic, but you also are aware of these blessings, making you a grateful person. People love you and you inspire others. You are like a spiritual guru and you have an AMAZING sense of humor. You are probably very religious or spiritual. These natives are very charitable and they believe in the good of people, while people believe in the good of the native. This results in the native‚Äôs world literally being as good as he/she believes it to be. Seriously, Sun trine/sextile/conj Jupiter is the best aspect to have! Sun in hard aspect to Jupiter results in the native being wasteful and over indulgent. These natives rely on the good of others to help get them out of situations their wasteful, negligent behavior has put them in. The funny thing is that it always works! Despite these ppls behavior, they face light consequences time and time again, resulting in them not caring about their actions much.  They are generous, overly so, and can be so optimistic that they end up falling into a depression when that optimism inevitably dies down. Sun-Jupiter natives are lucky, spiritual, enthusiastic, honest, funny, jolly, and charitable. They can also be selfish, addicts, and overconfident. No matter what though, they are BLESSED! Both the men and the women can be promiscuous, but they are not players. The health is very good, but due to their addictive nature, they need to watch their weight and stay away from drugs and alcohol. The bodies may have a natural bigness to them. Could be plump. The father figure could‚Äôve been a Sagittarius/Pisces, or Jupiter had a lot of influence in the chart. The father figure was probably real funny and/or religious and gave the native a blessed childhood.  

Sun-Saturn natives are responsible, cautious, and mature. Saturn rules authority and discipline  amongst other things, and Sun represents authority and fatherhood. So what you get is a very fatherly, orderly commander who probably does not tolerate ‚Äúmisbehavior‚Äù from others. Even the soft aspects, which are amongst my favorite aspects, give the native a tenseness about them. They feel they need to carry themselves a certain way that shows they have respect for themselves and they hate when others are disorderly. They respect others and have good manners, while being highly ambitious and disciplined. They are patient and will do their research before trying something out. They probably make enemies easily due to their naturally commanding vibes. They could make outstanding fathers who raise amazing kids. The natives with the hard aspects (My least favorite) doubt themselves frequently because they set the bar so high. They try to control things and people they can‚Äôt control which leaves them feeling like a failure. They long for recognition but don‚Äôt like to be in the spotlight. They have big plans that keep getting pushed back. They‚Äôre insecure with themselves and not all that confident. The Sun rules manhood, which naturally teaches you about life, and Saturn rules learning lessons, so this blend can make the native feel like they are failing again and again. Sun-Saturn natives are sober, mature for their age in youth, sarcastic, hard-working, commanding, cruel, emotionless, and ambitious. These traits manifest in men very easily and can make the men appear very masculine. The women can be like this too, and many are put off by her because of it. She can also cruelly judge a man and possibly has strict rules when it comes to finding one to date. (Makes them finer imo lol) The health of Sun-Saturn natives is either really bad or really good because the native will either give in to their cynicism and give up on themselves or they will get ambitious work hard to ‚Äúachieve‚Äù good health. The men can get muscular to add to their commanding aura. The women dress conservatively and with care. The father figure could‚Äôve been a Capricorn/Aquarius. The father figure was emotionally distant but was there for the native. The native may think the father figure was only present out of obligation and duty instead of love. The father figure was conservative and probably taught the male native how to ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù and taught the female ‚Äúhow to be a woman.‚Äù The native has never seen the father figure show a lot of emotion. The father figure was probably in the military or in a position of authority somewhere.

Sun-Uranus adds a rebellious and eccentric edge to the personality. These natives are open and are extremely individualistic. The soft aspects grant the native with popularity from society despite them being unapologetically themselves. The main reason for this is because they accept people for who they are and they don‚Äôt judge others no matter if they‚Äôre Democrat, republican, atheist, Christian, etc. as long as you‚Äôre not hurting anyone, you‚Äôre cool in the native‚Äôs book. Most people are astonished and intrigued by this, so they end up having a lot of friends from a lot of different places. They treat everyone equally even if someone‚Äôs ideologies conflict with the native‚Äôs. They have a unique, weird personality that everyone finds funny and endearing. They actually like delving into the how and what of people‚Äôs differing philosophies to understand them better. Just don‚Äôt compromise their freedom. Hard aspected natives are rebellious and try too hard to be different because they don‚Äôt like anything mainstream. The sole reason of this is because they want to feel different so bad that they distance themselves away from anything that‚Äôs popular or well liked. Those guys with the fedoras probably are the hard aspected natives. These people fail to see that everyone and everything is at least a little different. Sun-Uranus natives can be friendly but distant, ditzy yet astonishingly brilliant, experimental, and logical. The women could be a Tom boy, or very ‚Äúchill‚Äù when compared to other women. The father figure might‚Äôve been an Aquarius. The father figure could‚Äôve been involved in science or philosophy. The father figure was distant, but oddly gave the child enough attention. The father figure promoted freedom of speech in the household. The father figure was probably cool af. 

Sun-Neptune natives are imaginative, soft-willed, and very artistic. These natives are a quiet bunch who often day dream and have what if conversations a lot. Softer aspects are extremely sensitive and feel for others. They also have an uncanny bond with animals. They have an extreme appreciation for anything artsy. Music, writing, movies, they are big fans of all of those things. They are also very spiritual, to the point where they think everyone is as spiritual as them, which is not the case. They rarely stand up for themselves, but they feel they don‚Äôt need to. It is what it is, they‚Äôll say. They are introverts in every sense but don‚Äôt mind others‚Äô company. The harder aspects give the native addictive tendencies. They are or were probably drug addicts. There is a separation between their world and the real world. They need to separate the two because the real world is too much for them. They can be easily taken advantage of and are extremely gullible because of their sensitivity for others. Their identity is changeable. Overall, Sun-Neptune natives are socially adaptable, introverted, go with the flow type people who just want to chill. The health is probably bad; Neptune‚Äôs energy weakens the Sun‚Äôs, resulting in a person with a weak vitality. The men may be either lanky or overweight. The women may be the same. In some cases however, the excess weight can be distributed very pleasingly and the women can be curvy, voluptuous and plump. They need to stay away from drugs and alcohol and build their own world in a gym or some place outside. On the positive Sun-Neptune natives can also be into yoga, fishing and other peaceful physical activity. They love being near the water. The father figure was probably a Pisces or had a lot of Neptune/Jupiter in his chart. The father figure probably wasn‚Äôt there at all. The father figure may have been a drug addict. The father figure may have been distant and in their own world. The father figure probably encouraged the native‚Äôs imaginative habits. The father figure was probably submissive to the mother figure. The native probably has a delusional or exaggerated image of the father figure.


Sun-Pluto natives are intense. The native‚Äôs sun sign‚Äôs traits are intensified and are touched by Pluto. So, if your Sun sign is in a intense sign (Aries, Leo, Scorpio, Capricorn)  this will just make you extremely intense, to the point where people may be intimidated by or scared of you. Aries (Mars, rules conflict) and Scorpio especially. Even in the soft aspects with the less intense signs, there‚Äôs still something very intense about the native. The sun rules authority, Pluto rules power. What you get is a very commanding person even with the softer aspects. The softer aspect blesses the native with power, and an innate understanding of human nature. The native can feel as though, after a depressing and humbling experience, he has ascended pass the frivolity of society. The native goes through multiple personality changes throughout their life. The native isn‚Äôt necessarily friendly, but is cordial and accepts people for what they are. They are quietly confident and quick to stand up for themselves when they feel they‚Äôve been wronged. They‚Äôre not confrontational, but they are defensive. Before they get the things they want, they must have the power to do so, and they know that. They‚Äôll never put themselves in a position where their self respect, ego, and pride is dependent upon another person. They may not agree with people, but they easily understand them. They see the worst of society and still can understand that monsters aren‚Äôt born, they‚Äôre made. What has happened to make that person a murderer can easily happen to the next. The hard aspects give the native more cruelty in dealing with others. They are forceful and argumentative. They are insecure and tend to bring out other‚Äôs insecurities too, intentionally or not. They have a contempt for society. They fear looking vulnerable and may take advantage of others‚Äô. They dread the transformative experiences they go through. They are paranoid. This paranoia can end up being the source of a mental illness that might formulate. Sun-Pluto natives are intense, anti social, calm on the outside, crazy on the inside, callous, and brutally honest with a yearn to show humanity that we all have a bad side. Hard or soft aspected, these people believe that humans are too censored nowadays and have few friends due to that belief. They probably have a cruel sense of humor. People either love or hate them, and they‚Äôre aware of that. They don‚Äôt like public events because everyone there is ‚Äúfake‚Äù. The health for these natives is extremely good. They break down their bodies and build them back up through weight lifting. They have a high pain tolerance and the body heals from injuries quickly. The sexual vitality is very strong and they need an outlet, especially when the Sun sign is in Aries or Scorpio. Despite this, they‚Äôre not players and will hold back until someone that means something to them comes along. The men can be lean and muscular and the women can be toned and strong. Probably tattoos. The father figure was cruel, powerful, and obsessed with the native. The father figure was probably a Scorpio or had Pluto‚Äôs influence. The father figure was probably abusive, or forced the native to transform in some way. The father figure was manipulative but loving. The father figure would not hesitate to kill for the native. The father figure probably had a lot of intimate relationships. The father figure was crazy over the native.

That‚Äôs the energy of Gemini NN to me haha.

On a societal level...

SN in Sagittarius: end of my way or highway soap-boxing, end of dogmatic thinking being accepted as Truth, the illusion of fake news lifting, losses to the way we travel globally, less my way or the high way

NN in Gemini: fact over philosophy and theorizing, able to hold many ideas at once, expanding on the ability to change your mind, common sense, letting new information in

In general, SN Sag is the archetype of a well-traveled and knowledgeable sage, in whatever field, seeking to share what they know. This archetype appears to know it all, about everything, and will make sure you know that. The plus side is what this placement does indeed have a lot to share. The downside is that they don‚Äôt listen to other people, factor in the details, and have a hard time separating their ego from their smarts. Marco Polos.

NN Gemini is seeking to be that better listener, to siphon through all the relevant details and facts, to be comfortable learning from others. This placement is community oriented and less about traveling far and wide. Time to be in the present moment, here and now, what matters this second.

On a personal level...

It depends a lot on what houses Sag and Gemini are for you. And if there are planets there.

My basic approach: SN DRAIN, NN GAIN.

So wherever the NN is where we can experience gains, and wherever the SN is where we can experience drains.

Here are some ideas to get you thinking.

**ARIES ASC**: gains in the third house, drains in the ninth. a period of community oriented endeavors, of letting new ideas permeate your daily life. less lusting after faraway places and lofty mindsets, but letting the here and now spark wonder

**TAURUS ASC**: gains in the second, drains in the eighth. personal income from your own personal endeavors. make right with what you owe people and get your head around your debt. retooling your beliefs around money and possession.

**GEMINI ASC**: gains in the first house, drains in the seventh. a period of coming into your own without seeing other people as a necessity in that journey. speaking up for yourself, face forward now, retooling which relationships are needed and which you can jettison

**CANCER ASC**: gains in the twelfth, drains in the sixth. the daily habits or jobs that once sustained you are becoming beige boring or broken. looking towards the metaphysical to bring back a sense of magic and wonder, and letting that seep into your routines

**LEO ASC**: gains in the eleventh, drains in the fifth. less about what personally makes you feel good and more about what you can bring to the community to make them feel good. creation needs an audience, be it a piece of work, art, a child or yourself. you may make lifelong friends and associates, time to find your tribe. mingle

**VIRGO ASC**: gains in the tenth, drains in the fourth. volume is turned up on your place on the world stage. opportunities to bolster your sense of purpose will be abound. you may have to say goodbye to staying small or staying hidden, and bloom past what your family expects of you. an end of the comfort zone.

**LIBRA ASC**: gains in the ninth, drains in the third. a period of travel, whether journeys of the mind or journeys in real life. commit knowing all there is to know and seeing all there is to see and practicing all there is to practice. this will expand your horizons. true wisdom requires time and a nimble mind. spiritual passages await

**SCORPIO ASC**: gains in the eighth house, drains in the second. your sense of personal insecurity will be made up for by the graciousness of others. a period of true sharing, investment, and resourceful intimacy. the ways that you waste money or valuables (your time and energy and patience too) will become apparent, and asking for help from others is your best bet

**SAG ASC**: gains in the seventh house, drains in the first. a period of relationships that can help you reevaluate who you are and where you‚Äôre going. not the loss of self sufficiency per se, but the ability to let others co-pilot this stretch

**CAP ASC**: gains in the sixth, drains in the twelfth. time to be more real world oriented. the isolation that serves you, the spiritual practices that unnerve you, these are to keep and help you become better in life, on the job, and for others. all the other psychic chatter, alienation, trauma, sabotage that does not bolster you must go. break down to build up, not to stay broken. this opens up new ways to be of service, to remain flexible in your duties, and to remain childlike and light as you approach each day

**AQUA ASC**: gains in the fifth, drains in the eleventh. social exhaust. extraneous friends. arsenals of acquaintances. groups and beliefs you have grown out of. time to spring clean your social networks. a true sense of belonging comes from authenticity of self, and all else that spring from that. opportunities for pleasure, joy, art, creation, romance and love remind you who you are and who is worth keeping around. your own best friend.

**PISCES ASC**: gains in the fourth, drains in the tenth. a place for solid roots, a home, a family. these are all themes that are of concern. it is less important that you be respected by the world, by your colleagues, than it is that you have a place to relax and retreat, to feel safe and secure, to delight in the smaller successes of comfort, a family dinner, a mortgage in your name, and a place to lay your head. you step down from an authority figure, and are content to just feel content. your mom, your dad, your home.

NOTE that the drain/gain paradigm isn‚Äôt black and white. There won‚Äôt be complete losses in one area so don‚Äôt expect that. Rather, a clearing up, drain, allows for the gains to have space to settle in. For example, Gemini rising draining of relationships that don‚Äôt serve gives Gemini rising the space to come into their own. Doesn‚Äôt mean all relationships are doomed.

The SN and NN work in tangent. No need to completely ignore or abhor or fear one in service of the other. The SN is the launching pad. The NN is where we go once launched.

Also remember that the Sag/Gem axis is one that is inherently cerebral in nature. It deals a lot with the mind. So Gemini information gather versus Sag ""I know it all"" is what is fundamentally at play here. At the end of this period, you will **KNOW** more about what there is for you to learn i.e. these changes could, for some, play out entirely in your brain.

309,gqkfbw,False,None,51,Venus RX and Lilith ft. Doja Cat and Lana Del Rey,astrology,"These two women have been in the news lately for questionable behavior on social media, both with allegedly racist undertones. I'll leave the judgement and the specific goings on up to you readers, but the general taste these women have left in the public's (and their fan's) mouths has been sour. To say the least.

Because this is all playing out in GRAND, FLAGRANT form, I was like ""huh. wonder what Venus RX is doing to them."" Also--the changing of the nodes. These are some dramatic cosmic changes that can flip the script. Two women, adored, one breaking records--and now their reputations are in jeopardy. 

I also rarely work with Lilith, but coming fresh out of a lecture about sex in the natal chart, I'm easing into incorporating it into my work. And both of these women have Lilith playing out prominently here.

For female music artists, no doubt Venus plays a heavy role, just archetypally. But these women specifically have strong Venus. **Lana has her Venus on an angle in the 7th in Taurus, directly opposite her ASC and conj NN and Lilith. And Doja is a Libra Sun and NN.** The latter does not have a birth time, so I did a noon chart for her. The former has a chart rated A. 

Are these strong Venusian women unwitting victims of Venus RX?

**Lana** with NN conj Venus conj. Lilith in a Venus-ruled sign, playing out in the house of others makes a strong case for a woman whose sexual prowess, art, and carnal musings are RIPE for public consumption and opinion. In one IG post she lamented ""when FKA Twigs gets on the pole it's art, when I do it, I'm a whore."" Paraphrasing. Lana, in brief, has become fed up with her own sexual image being disparaged while the sexual images and creations of other women are being praised. With Lilith, this will be a constant issue. Madonna vs. Virgin Mary, whore vs. nun. Other strong Lilith celebs are Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian--both women whose sexuality hits a nerve in the zeitgeist and seem to transcend what is viewed as ok or normal. Lilith triggers. That's her job. 

**Venus RX i**s in Lana's 8th house, opposite her natal Uranus in Sag. Mercury is also currently in Gemini with the same opposition. The suddenness of her message is apparent in this transit. Her call for over an overhaul of her image is very Uranus, wanting to break free and forge a new path. Stunningly, and finishing out the theme, transit Uranus is in her 7th house, moving towards a conj. with her Lilith, Venus and NN. Venus RX in the 8th can call for a deeper reexamination of our sexual lives, our intimate places, and for Lana, how she is ""embodied"" by being in love, even if the relationship explores darker themes of abuse, imperfection and submissiveness. Gemini the messenger as her 8th gives her messages a sordid, deep, and here, sexual sort of tint. But playing out in aversion to her Scorpio ASC, it is not always in the best interest of how she is seen and perceived. AKA damage control. But the NN traveling through this house will compel Lana into an air of independence and forward-facing deep diving around these issues. 

**Doja's** foibles, though not identical, also harp on issues of sexuality and race. Though less reliable in a way, her **Unknown Time/Noon** chart has similarly compelling themes. First, Doja has natal Jupiter in Sag. That her ascent into stardom after years on the hustle coincided with Jupiter's foray into Sag last year is no coincidence: Jupiter Return. Cardi B and Meg Thee Stally had it too. Doja has natal Lilith in Gemini, which makes sense given she explores her sexuality online (has a song appropriately called Cyber Sex) in chat rooms, completely running through every social media platform that is available to her. It helped her connect to her fans, but has now also led to her downfall--as her overtly sexual and allegedly racist behavior in these rooms has caused her star to dwindle. Her Lilith squares her Saturn, bringing in themes around father and patriarchy--though not our place to speculate, her father (south African movie star) was not in her life, leading some to draw the conclusion that her oddly sexual internet behavior was due to an absentee daddy. 

You guessed it, **RX Venus is conjunct her natal Lilith**, coinciding with this theme of reversal around previously habitual (Gemini) sexual behaviors, and a fall from grace on the internet (Gemini). Also, and exhibitionist nature with her sexuality, her body, and beauty. 

With her Noon Chart, Doja is a Sag Rising, making Gemini her 7th. Like Lana, her 7th house Lilith and the Venus RX action in Gemini causing the public to cast their stones, appropriately or not. Sag ASC places Doja's Libra in the 11th, which is persuasive, given her complete charm and genius when it comes to exploiting all internet platforms for visibility. **A Sag ASC** is also curiously, if not sadly, appropriate here given that the **SOUTH NODE** is now there conjunct her ASC. A serious cycle of reckoning with how you come off to the world, learning to rein in unwise independence/selfishness, and truly coming to learn how to consider the other, and who you let into your orbit. It's also a time of maturation around 7th house pursuits like management and PR, the people responsible for Doja's image and allegedly the pen behind her recent apology. 

**Doja** also has a baby Mars at 0 of Sag (doing THE most), with this parade of Gemini transits all having completed an opposition with it, engendering a time of strife, battles, reflecting on your behavior, and standing up for yourself. And with a debilitated Venus in Scorpio ruled by this Mars and hiding out in her 12th, the battles of Venus--art, culture, sex, fame--are part in parcel for her particular brand of war.

Best of luck to both women. Humans gonna human.

321,elsrr4,False,None,64,Millennials VS Baby Boomers in astrology,astrology,"One astrological explanation for why Baby Boomers and Millennials fight is maybe because a lot of Baby Boomers have their Pluto in Leo while a lot of  Millennials have their Pluto in Scorpio. This is a natural square in astrology. Squares are aggravating, frustrating, and defeating energy. Leo and Scorpio are both fixed signs, so have the same goal. But since they are different elements, (water and fire) they go about accomplishing this goal in different ways. Both generations want essentially the same thing: a healthy society that encourages happiness for all its citizens. Leo is more materialistic, which explains why Baby Boomers value big business, luxury, material comforts. Millennials might focus too much on the shadow side of Leo, which is self-aggrandisement and selfishness, seeing Baby Boomers as separate to the rest of society/ think that they act like they‚Äôre too good for humanitarianism (Aqua.) I‚Äôm basing this off the 2019 UK vote, which showed Baby Boomers voting more right-wing, vs Millennials voting left-wing. So there‚Äôs an obvious divide 

Scorpio seeks a deeper understanding of things‚ÄîMillennials reject social conformities like monogamy, heteronormativity, ownership of property, child birth etc. They‚Äôre more open to spirituality and darker matters. They reject the ‚Äòtraditional standard‚Äô because those things don‚Äôt grant emotional fulfilment.

Then you have Sag Plutos, making their own journeys and exploring whatever is leftover of the Baby Boomer generation. A lot of it is in ruins: climate change, oil plants, massive debts and lack of affordable housing. They have the power to recognise and use opportunities to their benefit, and use their voices as a powerful change to the narrative. Which is why it‚Äôs important they vote.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/elsrr4/millennials_vs_baby_boomers_in_astrology/,295,"Hmmm...no real mentions nor in-depth analyses of Pluto in Libra branded millennials.

326,ew6ya3,False,None,201,Aries and Pisces are the rarest Ascendant signs,astrology,"An interesting observation here - Pisces and Aries rising are the least common among people in the world. In the Northern Hemisphere, Pisces and Aries (which are at the ends of the spectrum) rise for the shortest amount of time, contrary to the longest, Virgo and Libra, due to the Earth's axis. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendant#Long and short ascension) says that in Paris in France for example, Virgo and Libra rise for 2 hours 45 minutes, whereas Pisces and Aries only 1 hour. Even further north, like St Petersburg in Russia, it's 3 hours 20 minutes for Vir/Lib and only 35 minutes for Ari/Pis. Over there there would be so many less babies born under Ari/Pis ascending signs (doing the maths: 14% born under Vir/Lib each, 2% under Ari/Pis).

In the Southern Hemisphere it's of course the other way round - Pisces and Aries rise for the longest time, and Virgo and Libra the least - so more babies born as Ari/Pis ascendants. However considering that 90% of the world's population is in the Northern Hemisphere, that overall makes Pisces and Aries the rarest of them all. Also when looking deeper in the geography - the most populous country in the south is Indonesia, which itself is very near (and in fact at) the equator - thus the differences aren't that big. The most significant populous cities/regions in the south (that are distant enough from the equator) are around the 20-35¬∞S latitude mark. In the north meanwhile, most of the largest places/countries are already at least 30¬∞N: like China, USA, Pakistan, Japan, Egypt, Italy, Turkey, France etc. (and many of these are over 40¬∞N, including NY and Chicago). And at 50¬∞N and over the likes of England, Germany, Russia etc. 

This points that overall in the world, by quite a shot, Virgo and Libra ascendants are each the most common, whereas Aries and Pisces ascendants are the least.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/ew6ya3/aries_and_pisces_are_the_rarest_ascendant_signs/,292,"Fuckin awesome.

330,ei83fg,False,None,46,Possible New Years Eve/New Years Day Intentions and Affirmations for Each Rising Sign,astrology,"This is a completely random idea I had based on the position of the Moon tonight (Pisces) and the build up in Capricorn (where Jupiter is, Pisces's ruler). Because the Moon (and lunations) can represent where intentions can emotionally resonate, and Jupiter is the principle of expansion, optimism and faith, I'm using the confluence of these two planets and their locations in your chart to construct some fairly simple intentions and affirmations to consider. Capricorn and Pisces also form a harmonious sextile, and the Moon will aspect the Pluto-Saturn conjunction through this sextile, something I think matters as we consider what awaits January 12th and the themes that are probably already presenting themselves. Though not as seamless as a trine, sextiles still provide ease and success when acted upon and acknowledged. The opportunity awaits to be seized!¬†

(I understand that some people will be getting shit faced tonight, but you can easily do these on New Year's Day too.)  


**Aries:** I intend to set time aside to visit and nurture my hidden parts. Time spent in silence and introspection benefits me as I move into 2020. In these spots between my thoughts, remarkable new ideas for my changing career and purpose will reveal themselves to me. I move into my position on the world stage with ease and grace, and with with the invisible powers of cosmic companions always guiding me. Any insecurity becomes my security, and any hardship is insurance for my benefit.

**Taurus:** I intend to find and spend time with the people who matter most to me, whose goals and ideas are congruent with mine, and who champion my growth. I excel in communities of like-minded individuals, and flourish when I challenge my own beliefs and worldviews. 2020 brings to me a refreshed set of principles and beliefs, foreign experiences, teachings, and hope. I look forward to sharing what I've learned and experienced in the spaces that take me as I am.

**Gemini:** I intend to plant wondrously imaginative seeds for my career and invest in opportunities and people who share my vision. As I skip into 2020, I am reassured knowing that all I need is there. Debts are paid, forgiven, and pave the way for my comeback. Financial strength is my birthright and easily achieved through the discipline I am being taught. I learn to share and trust others with my gems, immaterial or material. I move into vulnerability knowing that it is my greatest strength, and provides the biggest dividends for my dreams.

**Cancer:** I intend to form healthy boundaries with loving people, and enter into relationships with a sobered and practical mind. What I have learned from others, good or bad, only serves to strengthen my belief in myself, and my suspicion that life is indeed good after all. As I enter 2020, my faith, though perhaps battered and bruised, remains alive. My emotional immune system is strong. I open my heart to new ideas and ways of thinking, beliefs that soothe my soul. I open my arms to people who wish to bring new ideas my way. I easily let go of people unworthy of my deep running waters, knowing that they will be replaced in multitudes by softer and kinder spirits.¬†

**Leo:** I intend to form a healthy relationship to...health. I know that my body is sacred, and that the foods and tonics I supply it with serve to enhance my day to day life. I am worthy of a firm, robust body, mind, and spirit. As I enter 2020, it is knowing that the work I do on a daily basis matters, and that I have the power to change and inspire my everyday, turning what is mundane into something magical. I rely on my spirituality and the help of benefactors to change what needs changing, and to uplift what may feel deflated. I have sound financial acuity, and am rich beyond means in heart, warmth and joy. The Sun shines forth as I go forth.

**Virgo:** I intend to dream bigger dreams of love, romance, and partnership. As I enter 2020, I know that disillusionment is turned to diamonds--clear cut and beautiful. Where I may have been left adrift by others set me on the path to wash up on shore of a love and personal life I never thought possible. I am grateful for the wild ride, and look forward to relaxation. The people and partnerships I meet, form and continue in 2020 inspire me to create, to play, to have fun, and to just enjoy. I am reacquainted with my inner child.

**Libra:** I intend to grow wherever it is that I am planted. I know that the peace and security of home cannot be taken from me, and travels and flows wherever it is that I go. I am safe, I am stable. As I move into 2020, I know that my body is restorative and strong, that ailments act as a catapult to launch me into stronger and enduring vitality. My work in the world is shifting, but gathers purpose and meaning along the way, as long as I have faith that I am on the right path. I do not mourn anything that has been buried or come to an end, for I know that they were seeds, and the forthcoming blossom will be worth it.

**Scorpio:** I intend to honor my words, thoughts, and ideas. Where my communication and mental processes may have been wrought with difficulty or confusion, I now let move me into creative ways to articulate and express. I am allowed to be unique, to think differently, and to let pain inform some of my greatest works.What I say and what I think matters. The players in my everyday life are of benefit to me. My neighborhood, my commute, my siblings...they all conspire to fill my brain and my life with fresh new perspectives and inspiration. I am out from under the trap of intellectual expectation, and I brand my own version of intelligence. I am the playwright of my own life, and am joyously filling my pages.

**Sagittarius:** I intend to value myself and the creature comforts that bolster my self perception and self esteem. As I move into 2020, I see money as a currency. That is, merely a source of energy that can be expended however I choose. I move forward knowing abundance will find me even around the darkest of corners, and carry me through comfortably as I reevaluate what does and doesn't matter. As I invest in myself, I invest in my home, knowing that firm footing creates the foundation for all of the dreams I have. My family and/or chosen tribe is where I find compassion, solace, and magic. They have my back, just as I have my own.

**Capricorn:** I intend to look in the mirror with pride. Oh how proud I am of myself! The rocks thrown my way do not break me. Parts of me may be cratered, but they are as resilient and beautiful as the moon--enduring, never complaining, always shining. As I move into 2020, I am becoming more of who I always knew I could be, and looking upon my shedding layers fearlessly, welcoming in my sturdy new skin. I hold myself in high esteem, and communicate with myself with unending compassion. I am brave enough to throw away outdated behaviors and habits, and to replace them with newer dreams and visions. As I do, my life resets, and the people and places I share this new life with reflect back to me the beauty of my transformation.

**Aquarius:** I intend to know my worth. Behind every breath, every pause, and every brief moment of introspection, is a whisper of encouragement from the recesses of my soul. As I enter 2020, I marry the immaterial with the material, using the sacred information found in bouts of rest and retreat to move me forth into abundance, in the hand and in the mind. I do not fear what is uncovered, what is ended, or what is perceived. I know that I am big magic, the ultimate alchemist, turning rough metals, with time, into gold.

**Pisces:** I intend to dream myself into being and to become the walking manifestation of my goals. As I swim into 2020, I recognize that the communities, groups and friends that have seemed to block my flow, are actually dams that help my waters runneth over. Associates and associations may have left me wanting, working, or weeping, so I now choose to spend my empathy and compassion on worthy companions and causes. I fear not that I've wasted any time, and am grateful to have been steered into this conviction. I know that the goals I have are worthy and possible, and that the people I need to make them happen are on the way. I build the dream, and the dream team too.

332,fhmr7m,False,Modern,41,Insights for those looking to astrology for signals about coronavirus,astrology,"Before I go further, I want to stress the important basics:

Stay grounded in the facts. Listen to local & national updates about the pandemic. Wash your hands for 20 seconds. Don't touch your face. Quarantine if you feel ill. Take advantage of the newly launched coronavirus telemedicine services (like [Roman's](https://www.getroman.com/coronavirus/)) if you feel you may have it.

I love looking to the sky for answers, but to make good work of it, we have to keep our feet on the ground.

Okay - that said...I want to share some interesting finds.

Here are my two resources:

* [Llewellyn's 2020 Astrological Daily Planetary Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Llewellyns-Daily-Planetary-Guide-Glance/dp/0738749427)
* [New York Time's Official Coronavirus Timeline page](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html)

For a few years now, I've found Llewellyn's daily guide to be a poignant resource for tracking both the major and minor movements in the planets from week-to-week. I like that the book calls out the key information of what is happening from an astrological sense and then provides some loose interpretation on top of it.

The fact that it's printed and shipped ahead of the year also helps imbue me with a sense of wonder when it gets things right.

For 2020, the Weekly forecasts were written by astrologer [Pam Ciampi, whom I'm sad to say seems to have passed away in January of 2019](http://sandiegoastrology.com/past-president-pam-ciampi-has-died/). May it only add to our respect for her life's work that this allows us to know with some degree of certainty that she wrote these forecasts well over a year before 2020 began.

Below are the passages that stuck out to me - alongside the NYT Coronavirus timeline and with some of my own commentary added in where I have something to add:

\*Emphases are mine.

# January 6-12

""Get ready, because even though this is only the second week of the new year, it features two celestial attractions that could rock your world.  The first is a Cancer Full Moon/Lunar Eclipse on Friday, January 10, that makes up the first of a bookend of **Cancer Full Moons that begin and end this year**.  The second is the **Saturn-Pluto conjunction on** ***Sunday, January 12***\*\*,\*\* that spells trouble in a number of different ways...

...Because these two heavy-duty planets only get together about once every thirty-four years, the results can be life-changing, with long-reaching consequences. While Saturn is busy protecting and preserving security and order, Pluto is seeking to destroy and transform by ferreting out what lies hidden beneath the surface.  Let's look back at the beginning of the twenty-first century to examine another time when these two planets were aligned. The Saturn-Pluto ***opposition*** of 2001 foreshadowed 9/11, which was a day that rocked the world because it was the first time the US had been attacked on its mainland. The events of 9/11 brought chaos and upset, including the never-ending war in Afghanistan and the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2020, Saturn-Pluto are ***conjunct*** in **Capricorn**, which highlights the **stock market, world banking, government, and big business**. This large, slow-moving transition is expected to include a global conversion to a virtual form of money (like cryptocurrency or blockchains), trade irregularities, economic downturns, and serious corruption and misuse of power. One way to approach the stress that the Saturn-Pluto conjunction is sure to bring is to be ready for any challenge that comes your way...With Mercury sandwiched directly between Saturn and Pluto, **the impact of this conjunction will be featured in news cycles around the globe.""**

***From the NYT timeline:***

**January 11 - China reported its first death.** On Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported the [first known death](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-death.html) from an illness caused by the virus, which had infected dozens of people. The 61-year-old man who died was a regular customer at the market in Wuhan, where the illness is thought to have originated, and he had previously been found to have abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease. The report of his death came just before one of China‚Äôs biggest holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.

# January 27-February 2

""Tuesday, January 28, is a low-energy day because that's when Mars, the action planet of the zodiac, makes a square to a **Neptune** that is overrun with negative feelings like guilt and shame \[*my note: this is due to some qualities of being in* ***Pisces***\]. Because this Mars-Neptune square also represents a **low immune function, go light on alcohol, eat well, get enough rest, and exercise regularly**. February begins with a square between the Aquarius Sun and Taurus Moon on Saturday, February 1, that brings a brief **tug between freedom and security**.""

***From The NYT timeline:***

**January 30 - The W.H.O. declared a global health emergency.** Amid thousands of new cases in China, a ‚Äúpublic health emergency of international concern‚Äù was officially [declared ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html)by the W.H.O. China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that it would continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to protect public health, and the U.S. [State Department warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/Coronavirus-travel-advisory-.html) travelers to avoid China.

**January 31 - The Trump administration restricted travel from China.** The Trump administration said it would [suspend entry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html) into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the last 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents. By this date, [213 people had died](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html#link-6a63a9b7) and nearly 9,800 had been infected worldwide.

# February 3-9

""**Thoughts and communications get more emotional** this week, because on Monday, February 3, Mercury leaves Aquarius and moves into **Pisces** for the next **two months**. Pisces is a tough sell for Mercury, because it's hard for the most logical of planets to lose its common sense to Pisces's ocean of emotion...Because **Mercury** will turn **retrograde** later this month, **communication will be under the influence of this emotion-based sign until April,** which is much longer than its usual three-week tour.""

# March 16-22

""Communications have been more confusing than usual this year with **Mercury in emotional Pisces** for an unusually long two and a half months. **Saturn** makes a **major sign change on Saturday, March 21,** as it shifts from **Capricorn**'s old-school traditions to future-forward **Aquarius**...**Saturn** will return for a temporary tour of **Capricorn in July and reenter Aquarius in December** for the next two to three years. **Mars**, also in **Capricorn**, makes two once-a-year conjunctions this week that have very different effects on energy levels. A positive **Mars-Jupiter** conjunction on **Friday, March 20**, combines **confidence** and **enthusiasm** with **courage** and **bravado**, which makes it easy to take action and start something new...The second conjunction, late on **Sunday, March 22,** is a dangerous once-a-year **Mars-Pluto** meeting that brings **power struggles, ruthlessness**, and possible **violence**. Take action Wednesday and do your best to stay away from conflicts on Sunday.""

# My Interpretation

When the year kicked off, I really felt the doom-and-gloom was America-Iran's explosive conflict and the Australia Fires. However, that was clearly (for now) not the case - and in fact, Fire is not the element where all of this action is taking place.

The transformation is happening in ***Water.***

Oddly, this also came through on a Tarot reading I did yesterday on coronavirus in which the [King Of Cups](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/king-of-cups-tarot-card) was suspended between the [High Priestess](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/the-high-priestess-tarot-card) and the [Death](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/death-tarot-card) cards. That, along with some other cards in the reading painted a picture of deeply rooted transformation on the emotional plane - with specific relations to water and health.

It didn't quite stack up with how I've been logically feeling about everything, but these astrological insights help.

**Water Signs** are playing a huge role in 2020. Most of the action taking place right now is in **Pisces** \- and the year itself is bookended by Full Moons in **Cancer**. Both, water signs. The dance between the two is in the awesome and/or terrifying emergence of our hidden, inner worlds (Pisces) and our sense of self-preservation and comfort (Cancer).

There are two levels to what we're struggling with right now as a planet: The **Pandemic** (our health) - and The **Panic** (our emotions).

The other signs very much in play with Saturn's energy are **Capricorn** (Earth) and **Aquarius** (Air). Capricorn, which is supposed to be a grounded home where all is in order, has been a domain of chaos since Pluto entered it in 2008 (see: the last financial crisis).

# Where It All Goes

Overall, the Cancer Full Moon bookends indicate we're in this story until the end of 2020.

I think we're going to feel some **relief in April** when Saturn gets its a\*\* out of Capricorn for a minute, but we'll be right back in it for its gnarly retrograde from August through next January after it slips back in for a bit before finally moving off to Aquarius for the long term.

So perhaps we're going to see some indicators of **how to beat coronavirus** in the **last week of March**, but they'll be hard-won. I'm guessing that has to do with the **strict quarantines** we're about to implement (especially in the US where a number of states are headed toward a shut down) showing that we can truly [flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html). I think that ""solving it"" feeling is inside the Mars-Jupiter energy. The ugliness of the Mars-Pluto energy in the same week is probably people not handling quarantine measures well. Maybe some panic shopping too. We'll get through it, but that will suck. **The solution itself will make people uncomfortable.**

This movement from Saturn to Aquarius? I think that's how we will discover the inspiration of how to live in this new reality. It's a truly special creative prompt at the core of it - something I [wrote about in this piece if you're interested in reading more](https://medium.com/@willcady/four-of-swords-what-tarot-can-teach-us-about-responding-to-coronavirus-panic-4bcdbac65557?source=friends_link&sk=27e730c437fa8b3f2f2d352daa2005cc).

We'll get a taste of our new way of life from April through July, but I think we have a lot of indicators that the Fall/Winter are going to be tough. An astrological look ahead there in detail would require a whole other post.

336,di671l,False,None,45,"Saturn-Pluto: starting World Wars, and what it means for us now (2020)",astrology,"Recently I was reading a very interesting article: 

[Causes of the 1st World War ‚Äì Saturn and Pluto](https://astrologyresearch.co.uk/causes-of-the-1st-world-war-saturn-and-pluto/)

In it, it talks about how the two planets were the major influencing planets for the two world wars. As you can read from excerpts of the article in posted in comment below, **for WWI Saturn and Pluto were conjunct in Cancer (the opposite sign of where it is now), and for WWII they were in an exact fixed-sign square (Taurus-Leo).** 
  I wanted to post this because as many of us know, Saturn and Pluto are now fairly close to each other in Capricorn (6 degrees apart), and will come into close conjunction (at around 22/23 degrees) in January of 2020.  I have a feeling that when that happens, it may well set the tone for the whole of that year since Pluto tends to be very deeply-felt and Saturn is in its home sign- so the feeling is that something is being 'set in stone' so to speak.  And already, we're seeing a lot of global tensions in the form of: 

*-Turkey invading Syria (and the Kurds allying with Russians)*

*-Trump's Impeachment and Ukraine investigation*

*-Britain having a troubled Brexit*

*-Climate protests globally* 

*-India 'invading' Kashmir without warning, continuing to keep it on lockdown* 

*-Protests in Hong Kong and the Chinese cracking down authoritatively on it, etc.*  

It feels like there is a lot of unrest in the air. Not saying that it will expand to the extent of another world war, but the Saturn-Pluto influence hints at why things are getting the way they are.  

Also, another very important thing: the two planets influenced the charts of major figures in the wars as well. I.e. At the star of WWI, the British appointed Lord Kitchener who had his natal Sun conjunct conjunct the then-transiting Pluto in Cancer.  Similarly, **many world leaders today have aspects that are tensely influenced by Saturn/Pluto conjunction (at around the 22-23 degree point) in Capricorn:**


1. [Donald Trump (USA)](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Trump,_Donald): **Natal 11th house Venus/Saturn in Cancer opposite transit Saturn/Pluto.**  Probably will feel a lot of judgment against him and psychological tension, like he's being persecuted (i.e. the impeachment) and the need to 'prove himself' in authoritative ways to feel loved and accepted by the public.

2.

4. [Xi Jinping (China)](https://www.astro.com/cgi/chart.cgi?wgid=wgeJwtTk0LwjAM_TWCQgZNZ-e09KAe1B28umvHylql6bAdY__eDry8j_Dyktl9nOJy8EqjpF61DhpHo6MBPKCACvAoSkB-YgxsbWDQEThcjHuvmev98TwDYmX4HsojCQET4EFUUCCv8wqTuu9Ie6P-tRvOWrcOe52MQpF9M5HJtB7KtKUQCLKgkMGGKZq4k11axvynT1bpNEsbF1Wg_EaFr9sP3NQ57A): **Natal Saturn and Neptune in Libra square transit Saturn/Pluto, natal Mercury and Uranus in Cancer loosely opposite.**  Like Putin, the Saturn/Neptune square can mean psychological tension (Neptune), as well as not wanting to follow the will of the mass consciousness/people (Neptune).  Transit Saturn square its natal position can give a general sense of frustration as well, like your leadership isn't being respected/taken seriously enough. Loosely opposite (5-8 degrees) natal Mercury/Uranus, it can mean you feel your own knowledge/wisdom is being undermined, and you have a need to vocally 'lay down the law' and not tolerate any rebellions/reform (Uranus).

He may well feel more vocal (Mercury) and want to make his own ideals and voice strongly heard, and not take no for an answer.  This transit boosts his willpower and authoritarian streak.

368,ervycq,False,None,99,Observation regarding fire signsüî•,astrology,"I decided to share this little note I wrote on my blog a while ago because I think fire signs are a little misunderstood.

*Disclaimer: these are my personal thoughts and observations. I am a fire sign myself.*

Fire & water are right-brained elements, which means that they are both inclined to be very creative (fact often overlooked when it comes to fire signs for some reason) & that they both deal with really strong emotions.¬†The difference is that water feelings run deep, while fire feelings burn out quickly.

People often portray fire signs as impulsive & volatile. One moment they‚Äôre mad, the next they‚Äôre laughing. It‚Äôs not because we‚Äôre unstable or inconsistent. It makes sense when you think about it. Fire, out of all elements, is the only one that can be created by hand. It‚Äôs there, then it‚Äôs not. It burns, but only to a point. Our emotions are the same.

Fire is candid and simplistic. A feeling is just what it is: a feeling. We feel it and we let it go. We don‚Äôt swim in it like water signs do. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre not inclined to hold grudges like earth signs do either. And to be honest, we're oddly sensitive to other people's energies too. Why? because fire engulfs everything around it when set free. Of course, it depends on the person‚Äôs other placements too, but that‚Äôs fire at its purest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/ervycq/observation_regarding_fire_signs/,275,I disagree.

372,ah0zbk,False,None,48,"What Each Rising Sign Can Expect from the LEO Lunar Eclipse, Blood Moon (Jan 20, 21)",astrology," The Full Moon in Leo is the last chapter of the series of Leo-Aquarius eclipses we have been experiencing for the last year and a half. A total lunar eclipse, this event gives you one final avenue to emotionally absorb and understand the lessons Leo has taught you. Standing boldly across the sky from the Sun at 0 degrees of Leo, this lunation roars, bursting forth with undiluted passion. It is said sometimes that any planet at 0 degrees is entering new territory. Though this is the last of eclipses in Leo for some time, its finality begets urgency‚Äîhow will you incorporate the lion‚Äôs lessons as you embark out into *your* new territories, the areas of your life that were set ablaze with realizations, dramas, or successes? Leo loves a show, always encouraging you to shine, take up space, and be unabashedly yourself. May what you have learned glitter through your awareness, and outward into your experience. And may you pass this final exam with flying colors, a spectacle befitting only the lion.

But of course there is no getting around Leo‚Äôs cooler and cerebral sister: Aquarius. All things exist on a continuum. There is no self-love without also considering the objective love of all humankind. There can be no ego without the collective that threatens to extinguish it, no heart without the veins supplying blood to it. And so as the Sun enters Aquarius on this day, focus shifts away from self and onto society. The Leo-Aquarius axis, to me, has always asked: where can your unique gifts and talents be of help and service to the world at large? Now is the time to consider this and set our compasses towards using our gifts to be a gift upon the world. And on a personal level‚Äîwhere can the places you shine help illuminate *your* world at large, the grand expanse of your own life?  This is an axis of creativity‚Äîwhatever is built in one area serves to grow and enlighten its opposite area. The Sun in Aquarius offers us an objective look at what these eclipses have meant for the unfolding of our lives, and now with this final lunar event in Leo, grow into an emotional understanding about how to move forward with it.

Uranus plays an important role in this eclipse, forming the apex of a T-Square involving the Sun and the Moon. Out of retrograde, Uranus may bring forth suddenness and surprises. A massive surge of energy in stable Capricorn, paired with your own skilled understanding of what the Leo-Aquarius eclipses have meant for you ensures that this doesn‚Äôt have to be destabilizing, but invigorating, perhaps electrifying your way forward with renewed gusto. And should anything disrupt your momentum, have trust in its ability to reroute you into diviner directions. These are fated times, my friends. Eclipse seasons always are. And with Uranus in the picture, life may orchestrate plot twists you never saw coming. But if you have faith in the overall arc of your life, the story it can tell, and your own agency over those stories, you are able to turn your pages without fear of what the future holds. For you know that there are no happily ever after‚Äôs without tending to what must come before.

**Aries & Libra:** The Leo-Aquarius eclipses lit up your 5th and 11th houses. Eclipses here may have invigorated your pleasures and creativity, expanding where you already have them, or opening the door where they have been denied. The common thread of creation and joy is self-love, seeing your talents as worthy of expressing, and seeing yourself as worthy to be admired by others. There may have been invitations to not to take life so seriously, or perhaps life became so serious that your only out was unadulterated fun and flow. There is courageousness on this axis, as inevitably, what is created in the 5th receives attention in the 11th. The interplay between your friends and groups, and your own sense of authentic autonomy may have been at play, teasing out those people and places that may not fully support your creative or carnal honesty or perhaps finding the ones that do. Issues of romance and dating could have also weighed heavily, as love, and finding it, is inherently a creative act. You may have sought the solace of children, created one of your own, or else unleashed the one within. This last eclipse asks you to make concrete where you create your belonging. 

*Leo on the cusp of the 5th house is the gift of play, Aquarius on the 11th means making sure that what you create can serve the greater whole.* 

*Leo on the cusp of the 11th house is the gift of congeniality, Aquarius on the 5th means making sure your social connections feed your heart.*

**Taurus & Scorpio:** The Leo-Aquarius eclipses illuminated the 4th and 10th houses of your chart. This axis is one of private versus public. The way you perform in your career seriously hinges upon the roots you plant for yourself. You cannot stand tall on rocky foundations. Eclipses here may have forced changes around your home or family, and seeing those changes directly benefit or subvert you in your public and vocational life. There may have also been a focus on yin and yang, passive and assertive, as teetering too far in either temperament jeopardizes your need to feel productive but to also feel at peace. Remember, you can have both. There may have even been power struggles with bosses, authority figures, family, or with your own pride surrounding house, home, and status. Keeping up with the Joneses squelches the creative energy that can be spent on building an authentic career that can serve your family and the world at large.

**Gemini & Sagittarius:** The Leo-Aquarius eclipses have rocked your 3rd and 9th houses. This is an axis of learning and teaching, community and foreign lands, communication and beliefs. This section of your chart has to do with broadening your mind and illuminating your life‚Äôs path through the synthesizing of education, whether through traditional or non-traditional means.

**Cancer: & Capricorn** This last series of eclipses has happened in your 2nd and 8th houses. The need for security and stability may have been a preeminent cause for concern. Known as a money axis, eclipses here may have granted you new ways to secure income or else focus on building a financial and material life befitting of you, perhaps through borrowing or from aggrandizing the personality. You may have also come into contact with the immaterial facets of security, like valuing your talents and yourself. How comfortable you feel here is in direct proportion to how much you can give of yourself. There may have also been events urging you not to base your safety or esteem on material gains, but instead on the inner riches of your humanness. This last eclipse asks you to make concrete the ways you choose to find value in your world, and to strike a balance between material breadth and emotional depth. Get serious about the debts in your life, be them financial or relational~~.~~ 

*Leo on the 2nd house cusp is the gift of creative abundance, Aquarius on the 8th means sharing that abundance, and yourself, with others.*

*Leo on the 8th house cusp is the gift of deep bonding, Aquarius on the 2nd means using those bonds to transform your esteem and attachment to material.* 

**Leo & Aquarius:** The Leo-Aquarius eclipses may have changed the way you present in the world, and interface with people. In your 1st and 7th houses, the axis of self and the other, you have experienced events that called you to step more authentically into your identity, and to live from a place of honesty. The eclipses may have challenged your self image, or called upon you to strengthen and make more functional your physical vessel. This relationship to self provides the means through which you relate to others, so your own personal dynamics became relationship dynamics. Through your bonds with others, you learned about yourself, and through your bond with yourself, you learned about others. This last eclipse asks you make concrete what you have learned through your interpersonal dramas, your evolving identity, and your relationship to your place in the world. 

*Leo on the 1st house cusp is the gift of popularity, Aquarius on the 7th means making sure others get to feel like a star too.* 

*Leo on the 7th house cusp is the gift of proud partnership, Aquarius on the 1st means making sure you‚Äôre also proud of yourself.* 

**Virgo & Pisces:** The Leo-Aquarius eclipses have brought activity to your 6th-12th house axis. Eclipses here may have triggered awakenings in the areas of spirituality and service. Mental health and physical health are also of concern. You have come to learn that the work and service you do out in the world has ramifications on your inner worlds and your spiritual health, and vice versa. Your inner and outer routines may have been forced into your awareness, where too much focus on the physical suffocates the metaphysical, and too much retreat into nebulous realms may limit your effectiveness in the real world. Events may have made you aware of habits that need to change, organization that needs to happen, body parts that need more attention, or work that needs to be done‚Äîall of which serve a greater sense of peace. A life in order becomes a sanctuary.  As these recalibrations take place either with your daily routines, or the cosmic routines of karma and psychic wounding, tend to yourself with compassion. For then it then becomes the compassion that is available to others. This eclipse asks you to make harmonic your invisible and visible worlds, building habits in both directions that can serve your life.

378,fgzusg,False,None,42,Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison,astrology,"his chart is rated C, so take with grain of salt.

I was interested in examining his transits for today (and other timings techniques) versus a natal explanation (which has been done here, If you search there‚Äôs a really good one by u/SmoothieGoat) to see what planetary energies contributed to his sentencing. He will likely die in prison, as his lawyers said even 5 years would be a life sentence.

His birthday is March 19th. So I saw it fitting to cast his solar return chart. There, he is in for a Gem Rising year with transit Uranus and Venus in his 12th. He is being imprisoned for his acts of sexual violence towards women (Venus). Uranus there, to me, completes a sad story shown in his natal chart. He has natal Uranus in Cancer opposite his Capricorn Moon. His relationship to his mom and childhood was most likely cold, hardened, and erratic in some way, and that first relationship to a woman, for men, can indeed portend how one may treat women as an adult. Uranus in his Solar Return 12th, almost at the exact same degree, illustrates a disturbing culmination to that natal promise. And indeed, with all the planets that have and are transiting Capricorn right now, those issues are at the very least karmically highlighted for him if not literally. He has Capricorn moon in the 3rd, which relates to upbringing. 

His solar return Chiron is placed in the 11th (honors, fame) conjunct his Sun in the 10th. Soiled reputation. Chiron in Aries is also ruled by Mars, and his is natally precariously placed in square to Pluto. 

His natal 7th house (Taurus) becomes his SR 12th house (imprisonment revolving around personal relationships), and for what it‚Äôs even worth, his SR 5th house, Libra (sexual desires), is his natal 12th. Venus rules both Libra and Taurus. So generally just a lot of themes of sexual impropriety, women, relationships, prisons, endings, death, etc.

His natal 8th, the place of death and mortality, is his solar return 1st house. Maybe he will literally die. Who knows. But he is certainly in the last chapters of his life. His solar return 8th house is Capricorn, with all 3 malefics currently placed there plus Jupiter. Heavy 8th and 12th emphasis is going to make for a dark year. 

His solar return Venus (and thus transit Venus) is forming a trine with Saturn and Pluto. Retribution and punishment for crimes against women. 

His solar return Moon is in Aquarius in the 9th. Aquarius occupies the 4th house of his natal, opposite that ruthless Pluto conjunct MC in Leo. He will probably be coming to terms with his career, his role in his own demise, and likely through 9th house themes of faith and religion. It‚Äôs not uncommon that convicted criminals come to devote their lives to Jesus (or whatever and whomever) while incarcerated. A real test of faith is beginning.

Transit wise, Mercury direct in his natal 5th. Whatever legal deliberations were needed were carried through with the directness of a Mercury direct station. Inward analysis became outwardly expressed conclusions. Pisces occupies his natal 5th so: sex crimes and the general dark side Piscean gaslighting, seeing how far one can take things, zero boundaries, etc.

There‚Äôs something about his NN at 0 Pisces (conj Venus) and his Sun at 29 Pisces that is profound to me. I can‚Äôt articulate it but his soul incarnated for some challenged lessons around women, sex and pleasures. Yeesh. 

Interestingly but not exact, his natal progressed mars stationed retrograde and is marching backwards into his 12th house to join his natal RX Neptune and RX Saturn. While his natal progressed Venus is marching up into his 8th. 

His progressed Moon is also conjunct that natal Uranus I spoke about above. He is also in his 8th house year right now about to enter a 9th house one, where that Uranus and progressed moon are. 

A culmination of themes.

381,f3ay47,False,None,33,How Aquarius Can Offer Us Our Best Chance at Love (Happy Valentine's Day).,astrology,"Hi everyone,

Ahead of Valentine's Day tomorrow, I wanted to re-share this researched dig into Aquarius I did last year. It seems that the Aquarius archetype is at odds with the lovey dovey commercialized Valentine's Day we know of now. But maybe it makes...perfect sense?

Enjoy below and enjoy tomorrow, whether you are coupled or single. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

 

**Reframing Aquarius: How the cool and detached offer us our best chance at love**

Like Capricorn and Christmas, Aquarius and Valentine‚Äôs Day seem to be fundamentally at odds. Where the serious Saturn-ruled earth sign seems incongruous to merrymaking, so does the Saturn-ruled air sign seem an out-of-place home for one of the more *romantic* days of the year. If pop Astrology had its way, Aquarius would remain inextricably associated with stereotypes of distance and detachment. While those descriptors are certainly relevant, they are not the end of the story. ¬†You may find Taurus or Libra more fitting for Valentine‚Äôs Day, where the planet of love and romance is home. Or Pisces, where the planet of love and romance is exalted. Perhaps even Leo, where bouquets of red and pink balloons and Leo-ruled heart-shaped boxes of candy proudly boast and roar: *love!*¬† But in removing the superficial layers that surround the misunderstood Aquarius, we can come to understand why Cupid‚Äôs foray through this cerebral sign is no accident, and rather points us towards a more fitting, yet shocking, conclusion: that the Aquarius love is deep and endless, that the Aquarian heart throbs with undiluted passion. If this shocks you, good. Aquarius enjoys a revolution. And so may this revolution set Aquarius free from misinformation, and set ablaze a new way of thinking.

Where Taurus makes love physical, Libra makes love artful and Pisces makes love dreamy‚ÄîAquarius makes love *ideal.* In any working definition of the word *romance*, ‚Äúidealized love‚Äù makes a literal or alluded appearance. It can be said, then, that from Aquarius, the *idea* of love is born and celebrated. And from ideas, all things sprout. This isn‚Äôt altogether odd. Aquarius deals with intellect and logic. And ruled by Saturn, striving towards lasting standards of excellence and fairness, signposts of anything ideal, lines up with what we know about the archetype. So in enhancing love to its most ideal place, the Aquarius romance comes with a bigger heart and bigger mission. As a humanitarian sign, Aquarius is not particular about love‚Äî who deserves it, who is giving it, why it went away, when it‚Äôll come, how it looks, etc. With the power of scope and objectivity, Aquarius love transcends physical limitations and instead becomes a universal concept under which all of humankind can shelter. And what could be more romantic, more loving, than the unrelenting acceptance Aquarius offers? And so where things aren‚Äôt sensual enough for Taurus, refined enough for Libra, or magical enough for Pisces‚ÄîAquarius asks no price of admission, for love to them remains priceless, a public good to be doled out and shared not on pretense, but on brotherhood. It is Aquarius‚Äôs love of humankind and fraternity that expands the concept of love: come one, come all, and come as you are. 

Saint Valentine of Rome, whose written account has come to serve as a historical template for the beginnings of Valentine‚Äôs Day, acted out these Aquarian ideals. He performed weddings for those forbidden to marry and when sent to jail, healed his jailer‚Äôs daughter of blindness. Afterwards and right before he was due to be executed, he sent a letter to the jailer‚Äôs daughter, and signed it, *your Valentine.* Saint Valentine of Rome was also said to give out paper hearts while ministering to people about God‚Äôs love, and a direct line can be drawn from this action to the typical Valentine‚Äôs Day decorations we see today. In this brief tale, we meet two Aquarian archetypes, the former more recognizable than the latter: rebellion and compassion. A humanitarian thing to do despite the laws of the time, Saint Valentine, though perhaps not an Aquarius himself, extolled all of the best, yet often ignored testaments of the sign‚Äîthe push towards equality, that all deserve to have their love legitimized and recognized, endless empathy for the human condition, and the Love with a capital L that drives one to such measures. Religion aside, Valentine lived and died on one principal: that love, in all its myriad forms, is for all. Anyone who dies for love is a romantic to me. That the Sun was travailing through Aquarius as the framework for our modern conception of Valentine‚Äôs Day was underway can be no coincidence. All of Astrology bears correspondence to human events, even if they remain obscured or misunderstood for a time. But let‚Äôs mount more evidence...

In Ancient Greece, Aquarius season coincided with *Gamelion*, the month of marriage. Two festivals occurred then, roughly translated to *Sacred Wedding* and *Divine Wedding.* These festivals celebrated the union of Zeus and Hera. In Roman texts, Hera was known as Juno, the goddess of marriage. If Juno sounds familiar, it is because an asteroid was named after her and has come to represent what is looked for in marriage and commitment. Modern natal chart calculators can show where Juno is in the sky for the native, and most often it points to the characteristics of a most suitable long-term partner. So what is it about Aquarius that corresponds to these cultivations of lasting love and marriage? Look to the element and modality: fixed air. Like any fixed sign, Aquarius holds on tight and when best expressed can exalt the virtues of *fidelity.* Of course, any ideal marriage or partnership needs this brand of loyalty and perseverance. Though much is said about the Aquarius need for space, even the Aquarius need for isolation, it cannot be overlooked that when in love, Aquarius is one of the more steadfast partners, seeking not for frivolous union, but for deep connection. But the elemental structure of Aquarius sets it apart from the rest of the fixed family. It can be said that inherent in the Aquarian archetype are two life-sustaining elements: air, and water, as Aquarius is the water-bearer, often mistaken by novices as a water sign. No living being can do without air or water. And so the Aquarian love is life-sustaining, from which all bounty and blessings grow, from which all beings benefit. It is the grandeur of this concept that gives Aquarius its aloof quality‚Äîtheir love is so universal and welcoming that to the casual observer, it appears impersonal. But it is precisely the scope of Aquarius love that makes it so palpable, an equally matched breadth and depth. Where fixed Taurus can become materialistic, fixed Leo can become self-aggrandizing, and fixed Scorpio can brood and become paranoid, no more fixed is Aquarius than the air it represents: ubiquitous, self-sustaining, stretched over distance yet deeply intimate, as oxygen and the connectivity of breath is shared by all. Co-dependency has long reigned as a romantic model of love, clinginess and self-dissolution perversely used as measures of affection. Psychology has now caught up and identified this proclivity as self-sabotaging and unhealthy. The Aquarius model of live and let live in love can appear threatening to the osmosis some wish to experience, or expect to experience. But it offers us our best chance of healthy love‚Äîas when air is squelched out of the equation, breathing becomes labored, and the life of the relationship is threatened. When inserted in mutually consented amounts, air allows for space, wherein two individuals (or more, \*wink\*) can fully stretch out into their identity, their lived experience, always feeling supported, but never entrapped. That is what Aquarius offers‚Äîa love given the air to float, fly, and transcend.

In a sense, and as alluded to above, Aquarius love can be cerebral. But as all things start with thought, this isn‚Äôt to be feared. The belief of a thing creates the experience of a thing. So for Aquarius to hold you in their minds with love and affection is to tap into a potent creative energy, one that serves as the basis for all emotion and action. Intellect has no bounds. Neither do the Aquarius flights of fancy. And because these ideas are *fixed,* good luck changing the Aquarian mind. Once loved, always loved. For Aquarius, the idea of love for a person, up close or from afar, is to render that love timeless and shapeless, graduated out the physical dimensions of gift-giving, face-time and attention, and into an ethereal experience. Aquarius is the sign of freedom and independence. To give love the freedom to expand, to individuate, untethered by expectation or precedent, is to experience ecstasy. 

Aquarius is ruled by Saturn. There is, then, a resonance with Aquarius and Saturn‚Äôs sign of exaltation‚ÄîLibra. Libra, in some ways, is the sign of marriage, one-on-one partnership, diplomacy, and fairness. Therefore, there is a through-line connecting the idea of peaceful partnership and love to the Aquarius archetype. With this link, Saturn, and by virtue, Aquarius, can delight when relationships become stable and enduring, planting fertile ground for love and romance to blossom perennially. 

In sum, I invite you to reframe what you‚Äôve heard about Aquarius. Leave room for the wondrous ways in which this sign offers us our best chance at experiencing a true love, and hold space for a history that can corroborate it. Remember that as the water bearer, Aquarius has within it all the emotional capacity apparent in any other sign. Only, unlike any other sign, Aquarius shoulders these emotional conditions with impenetrable strength and understanding, turning them into nutrient, tilling human soil, watering it with compassion. In this alchemical process, all human experience, the sordid and splendid, meet their highest resolution in the arms of Aquarius. It is this level of belonging, of feeling seen and heard, that allows unbridled love to flow. It could be that the Aquarius tendency for distance and austerity is merely erected as a means of protection. That the love they feel for others must somehow be contained behind a wall, less it completely overwhelm them, less their waters drown the world. But do not be mistaken‚Äîbeyond the ideas of coldness and detachment lies a soft, loving center. A sweetness disguised, but always alive.

*‚ÄúLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind*  
 *And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.‚Äù*

This also makes me feel better about my boyfriend, actually. He's all fixed energy and his Mars in Aquarius rules his Scorpio stellium. He's pretty darn self preserved and I was convinced for a time he just didn't have emotion.

383,g1ve1m,False,Discussion/Debate ,154,Scorpio placements brings challenges,astrology,"I‚Äôve noticed that Scorpio placements (especially as your big three or first house) can give people with these placements a ton of challenges early on in life. Whether that be growing up in a not so friendly environment, parent divorces, abandonment, not feeling welcomed, loved, or feeling out of place (kinda like being a black sheep), or having too much pressure put on you. This may not resonate with everyone but I‚Äôve noticed it in people with Scorpio in their sun, moon and risings. I have a Scorpio rising with Pluto and Mars in the first house and I definitely felt like I grew up feeling unwanted and dealing with a lot of abuse and gaslighting, but I feel like these challenges so early on are really meant to test our strengths and overcome them. Scorpio is the sign that has the power to delve deep into the underworld and come back out of the ashes fully transformed and evolved. 

Anyone else with these placements feel this way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/g1ve1m/scorpio_placements_brings_challenges/,260,"There‚Äôs something I really admire about Scorpio suns and people with strong Scorpio placements, I feel like they‚Äôre a much stronger water sign compared to Cancer, they‚Äôre also a water sign but capable of doing so much more. My placements in Aquarius and Gemini do make it somewhat difficult for me to relate to Scorpio suns or people with strong Scorpio placements who aren‚Äôt healthy or haven‚Äôt undergone soul-searching (despite my Cancer sun), but as long as the individual‚Äôs at least somewhat healthy I find that I can get along with Scorpios and people with Scorpio placements quite well. Now, if their Pluto is also very prominent, that‚Äôs more of a problem for me (Plutonic energy doesn‚Äôt not necessarily have to be Scorpio energy). Pluto is not an energy that I feel your average person can handle well.

   One of my best friends whom I get along very well with is Scorpio Sun, Mercury, and Venus. Not sure about his rising but his Moon is in Capricorn and his Sun and Venus are Conjunct Pluto. His Sun and Mercury are at degrees that square my Aquarius moon, but then he‚Äôs got an Aquarius Mars which makes him a pretty easygoing and fun but still a very insightful and deeply intelligent guy. I feel like his Mars in an air sign really balances out the Scorpio though it‚Äôs square his Sun and Venus. Hell his moon‚Äôs even in Capricorn but I don‚Äôt feel it very strongly at all as I have done with some other Capricorn moons (I feel restricted and suffocated by their cold, almost stoic nature). Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs in the last 10 degrees of Capricorn? (I don‚Äôt know what time of the day he was born but if he was born at night or near midnight on his date of birth the moon would be inching towards Aquarius)

   My older male friend of over 10 years (11 to be precise) is Leo Sun, Scorpio Moon. There have been a couple points in the past where I was taken aback by his sudden spurs of emotional intensity, where I felt I had stepped on a landline. However, our bond has remained very durable throughout the years and we‚Äôve helped each other through lots of hard times. His Mercury in Leo is sextile my Venus in Gemini and Mars in Gemini, as well as trine my Saturn. His Sun in Leo sextiles my Venus and Mars. His moon trines my Mercury in Cancer, possibly trines my sun and Sextile my Jupiter too.

  His Venus and Mars (conjunct) in Virgo Square my Venus and Mars in Gemini, but both are sextile my sun and trine my Jupiter.

   What I feel is that both of my friends, who have Scorpio placements, have their influence balanced out by air and fire, and that despite both having Scorpio placements and Pluto aspects to their personal planets that their Plutos may not feature all that prominently.

   OTOH, my ex was a Scorpio Sun, rising, and Mercury with Capricorn Moon, Venus and Mars in Sagittarius but close enough to Capricorn to oppose my Mercury in Cancer. She also had Pluto in the 1st house. Her moon was at a degree in opposition to my sun and mercury, my moon was Square her sun and Ascendant. Pluto in the 1st house (despite it being in Sagittarius) I feel was the real culprit. She was manipulative and an emotional wreck. ",2020-04-15 16:33:20

397,e4pdz8,False,None,116,Pisces; the divine sign,astrology,"Pisces is the last sign. And in many ways resembles an old soul, or in a metaphoric way; an old person. It's the sign of self undoing and is the closest to death. This can bring a feeling of complete peace, or in the lower form, terror paranoia delirium self pity and anguish. It's also the sign of two fishes, and can be as dark as its sister water sign Scorpio or soft as a Cancer.  It's ruled by Jupiter, the great benefactor. 

I emphasize that Pisces is similar to an old soul because it is essential in understanding this mysterious sign. Pisces is selfless and has little worldly ambition. Think of an old man who has done it all, it feels like it's mission on this world is done and is now ready to leave and transcend. Usually they turn to spirituality and religion. Almost turn monk like, quiet and peaceful, going with the flow of life, seeing the profound beauty in everything, letting go of desires and materialism, and being a martyr when necessary. This is Pisces at its best. With its intuition and depth of feeling, they have the capacity for great soul growth. Regular meditation and dedication to service is vital for its growth. However as it's lower self, a Pisces feels lost and turns to become indulgent and escapist. They can get too stuck in dreams which can be good but sometimes can turn into illogical thoughts, meditation can help them stay grounded. They have to realise that life itself is but a beautiful dream and they have to stay lucid. With its wisdom it can bring great insight to its loved ones and can be a healing stabilizing presence.

403,cbf1zc,False,None,34,Don't blame it on the planets,astrology,"I wanted to make this post because I see a lot of memes and simplistic assumptions about the movements of the planets and I feel like many people who are probably new to astrology are misinterpreting what the meaning and use of astrology is, and in doing so they're limiting what they can potentially get from this very powerful and life-changing area of study.

https://preview.redd.it/zff6l2fnag931.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d0e7b69e5f835031410ea1b7d1dbc7d8a9a716d

Look at the image above. This is taken from the most intuitive side of psychology, namely gestalt psychology, which in my opinion is what comes closest in terms of pure reasoning to the logic of astrology and the occult sciences in general.

Here you can see three different pictures, but each one of them has different interpretations according to what you interpret as the figure and what you interpret as the background.

&#x200B;

The correct use of astrology, in my opinion, should not be to point at a chart and say ""oh, this is why x is happening, it's because this chart shows this aspect/transit. The transit/aspect is causing what is happening to me right now"". It actually be the opposite. You should look at your self, at your inner life, at your first-hand experience (and this is why I think that studying astrology without studying the psyche is almost useless), and use astrology as a tool to discern, in your field of consciousness, what is the figure and what is the background. So instead of saying ""x planet is giving me a very hard time"" or ""brace yourself, x transit is going to happen"" you might say ""oh, I'm having a major Pluto transit, this is why I'm having such a hard time. I better find those areas of my life and of my self that need urgent transformation, or I'm going to be in trouble"". Or, to make another example: ""Oh, I thought everybody was just being annoying, but it turns out that mars is transiting my natal moon"". 

This way, you use astrology to properly discern what is the background from what is the figure, bringing clarity, power and purpose into your daily existence. 

&#x200B;

To put it in other words once again: your first-hand, personal experience and the content of a given chart are not separate entities and do not represent separate realities. They complement each other; one brings more clarity to the other and vice versa.

&#x200B;

As Richard Tarnas used to say, the planets do not rule our lives and vice versa. They are part of the same flowing universe. When we look at a clock, we don't say that the clock is determining time. The clock is only indicating time, something which is already there. Astrology does the same with the soul: it doesn't determine how our lives go, but it can help us in understanding the dynamics occurring in the deepest layers of our being.

Then take another person, they might blame life‚Äôs circumstances and never fully learn their Pluto lesson. 

Both people going through the same events and both have different outcomes. Is that related to their blaming of the planets? No it basically comes down to how they handle adversary. 

You could have 2 other people and they‚Äôre into astrology and one learns their lesson and the other doesn‚Äôt... again that comes down to how they handle pain, do they blame external events or do they adapt?

410,djimkt,False,None,41,I'm Gonna Let You in on a Little Secret (about Saturn transits),astrology,"It's normal and common to feel bad, even a bit depressed during major Saturn transits (to your Asc, Moon, etc). I know what that's like, because I have a history of depression and burnout that goes back to high school (decades).

But I've also made major changes in my life during major Saturn transits -- because I believed in myself, made big decisions, and accepted help from friends and family to do it. 

I'm going through a Saturn transit conjunct my natal Moon right now and I feel great. I feel like encouraging other people to have hope and know these 'down' times are only temporary.

The secret is these kinds of Saturn transits bring up unworthiness. So we feel down or depressed or stagnant to the extent that we feel unworthy of happiness or well being. The other part of the secret is that because of Saturn's social interface through paternalistic familial influence (father, teacher figures) we begin putting on ourselves expectations pre-fabricated by these people and society without our input. We start expecting things of ourselves they do -- even without cause or leeway given to our uniqueness. 

You don't have to. 

You can literally just stop believing in all the stuff you've heard people say about success and failure, stop saying it to yourself. Stop believing in failure (or success). 

Instead -- be true to yourself today by re-committing yourself to understanding yourself best you can, trusting yourself to make the next move, trusting yourself to follow your own ideals. 

Stop taking off-the-rack beliefs about success or failure. Stop believing because you haven't made it by 30 (or any other age) that you're failing. No, you're on a journey and you're on a path that is your own. Your parents, grandparents, and teachers haven't been in your shoes or down this path -- and they never will. If you don't trust yourself to make the right moves and decisions for you there is always the chance you'll feel like a failure or feel unworthy. 

Saturn's influence is a bit like lead, slower and heavier, but we all have times where things slow down a bit or feel heavier. Don't let it steal your emotional balance or perspective on yourself and life. 

What matters most is what you've pieced together by the end of your life. Something you can look back on and be proud of -- not because its big or glows like the legends of worldly success put forth by the generators of motivational sayings and glossy magazines. Because it resonates with the real you inside and is true to your integrity.

Why gauge our worth by someone else's outer appearances? 

Most of us are never going to be ""successful"" by the standards of inventors or celebrities. Be true to your principles and ideals, and if you've not developed those yet, it's never too late. 

The secret is to re-parent yourself like the father (or mother) you wish you had. It takes time. I'm nearly 50 and I can't say I've got it down yet -- but I'm a lot closer and doing a lot better at it. I'm better at treating others the way I want to be treated. 

You never have to look forward to unavoidable and inevitable Saturn transits with a sense of dread. Yes, it might be a time of a bit of struggle, but don't let it sour your attitude. Attitude is 90% of life. The other 10% is relatively trivial.

You never have to worry or be afraid of *what Saturn might do ... (to me)*. It brings the circumstantial stuff of life:  delays and challenges to meet. That's life. Don't fear it. Anticipation of something bad from Saturn is exactly the fear you need to let go of to overcome it.

411,hr743v,False,None,32,A Beautiful Astrological Portrait Connecting Naya Rivera and Cory Monteith,astrology,"I want to preface this by saying that this post will be centered on celebrating the life of Naya Rivera, and finding cosmic catharsis about what Astrology can show us about this moment in time for her and her soul. I will be couching everything in my Aquarius brand of impartiality, which I hope conveys a spirit of education and understanding versus usurping a tragic moment for clout. Though, if you see it that way, I do understand. I figured that since now all the what if's and when's and how's of the event have been answered, it would be an ok time to approach this event from a spiritual POV, and add to the zeitgeist of the moment.

I won't be examining the death of Naya or the circumstances surrounding it. I instead was curious about the Astrological through-line between Cory and Naya, and how the day of her recovery marked 7 years since his passing.

One of their Glee costars stated that Cory, in spirit, helped find Naya yesterday, bringing closure and peace. That made me go ""hmm"". And instead of excavating the crude facts of the moment, I was curious to examine what Astrology had to say about more intangible things like spirit guides, or help from beyond, the soul, and other karmic resonances.

Naya's body was recovered at 9:10 am in Ventura, CA (Lake Piru) on July 13th, 2020. [source](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/naya-rivera-dead-glee-star-body-drowning-obituary?bfsource=relatedmanual)

For this, I want to focus on the NN (soul stuff), the MC (the most elevated part of the chart) and the Sun. Why? I figured that a recovery mission, something brought to light, would engage the planet of spotlight (Sun) and the highest moment in the sky (midheaven/MC). NN would point more towards the soul direction of a moment. I will also incorporate the 12th house--where things hide, and especially in water. Here is what I found:

\-The chart of the moment of recovery for Naya has the MC at 27 degrees of Taurus. Cory's Sun in Taurus conjuncts that point.

\-Cory's Sun in Taurus is also in Naya's natal 12th house. When you read this from a synastry POV, there are overwhelming themes of unconscious/subconscious bonds. Trouble, endings, loss. The Sun person illuminates the 12th house. Extrapolate if you will, to see Cory's Sun as helper/finder of Naya's resting place, where she lost her life, where she transitioned into the unconscious

\-The asteroid ""Cora"", closest to Cory (which I've learned is okay--to find the object with the name CLOSEST to the one you're looking for), is exactly conjunct the NN of the moment, 28 Gemini. Naya's natal Moon is also 28 Gemini in the 1st house. Cora, besides being facsimile for ""Cory"", is a name derived from the Greek goddess Persephone. She was goddess of the underworld, and represents the ""perennial change from life to death""

\-With the NN of the moment at 28 Gemini, exactly conjunct her natal Moon--we can see that the direction of karma in the moment related to her identity as mother. She put the responsibility of being a mother ahead of herself (Moon in 1st house). Reports are now showing that Naya used the last of her energy to boost her son up on the boat, unable to muster the energy to save herself.

\-In the chart of Naya's recovery, the asteroid ""Nayam"" was in the 12th house, and ""Nayan"" in the 7th conjunct Neptune, a planet responsible for drownings.

\-Cory's Cancer NN conjunct the Cancer Sun of the moment Naya was found

\-Seven years ago, Mars was at 29 degrees of Gemini, conj Naya's Moon. Conj. the NN of her recovery. Not sure what this means but wanted to make mention.

\-Naya's NN in Aries squares Cory's NN in Cancer almost exactly:

&#x200B;

>*""When one person's Nodes squares the other person's Nodes in synastry this will correlate to two¬† Souls who have been in some kind of relationship in which various dynamics and issues between them has caused them to separate from one another previous to the current life.  Coming into this life with that signature correlates to the intentions of each of their Soul's to 'pick up where it was left off' in order to continue to confront those issues so that the evolution together can continue in some way.""*

I find that to be very resonate, given that she was found on an anniversary of his death, and generally also died around the anniversary of his death. Both of their souls were working in tangent, but it is not up to us to clearly know or see how.

That is all I have for now, or perhaps forever. Without Cory's actual birth time and therefore house placement, there is only so much excavation that can be done. But I hope what I provided above helped you to be able reframe the breadth (and depth) of astrology, and see how it can be used to tie together resonance between two souls.

Thoughts? I'm 100% down with people thinking this is a stretch.

424,dtl9ly,False,None,77,The Delusion of Kanye West ft. Neptune and Jupiter,astrology,"Just read an article that Kanye is considering a 2024 presidential run and a name change to ‚ÄúChristian Genius Billionaire Kanye West‚Äù or some such. 

The armchair psychiatrist in me screamed: ‚Äúget this man on medication post haste!‚Äù

But the Astrologer in me was like ‚Äúthis all makes sense.‚Äù

Kanye West is a 16¬∞ Pisces Moon. Which means RX Neptune is right on his Moon right now, a second pass, and will have a third pass later when direct.

Pure fodder for delusion and being fanatical about Christianity now. His natal Pisces Moon (and therefore transit Neptune) also squares his bombastic and frankly narcissistic Sun conj. Jupiter in Gemini, further exacerbating these delusions of grandeur. Neptune square natal Jupiter is perfect for finding religion, and unfortunately can result in a lot of fanaticalism. Most Christian televangelists have very very strong Jupiter or Pisces. With the natal Sun there, his ego is more than tied up in this new, ramped up holier than thou disposition. Adding fuel to the fire. 

Now his natal Neptune is in Sag. Guess where Jupiter is now folx? Yep, Sag‚Äîin Western Astrology. That means there is a double Jupiter to Neptune circus playing out for him, and BOTH worsened by the triple passes of retrogradation. Transit Jupiter is pretty much done with him, but laid the groundwork for his...I want to say, extended manic episode. Jupiter blows everything up. 

What does this create? A t-square! Neptune opposite Sun/Jupiter. And a Pisces Moon apex. The release from the tension is found through his Pisces Moon, which is why religion is of particular importance for him right now. (Plus I didn‚Äôt mention that natal Neptune opposite natal Sun and Jupiter can create this fantasy wherein you believe you are the best, that no one understands you or is on your level, and frankly someone with disassocative personality and mood disorders. The ego is fractured by the dissolution of Neptune). A mutable T Square can also make ripe conditions for someone who is erratic. Also fitting for his bipolar disorder.

I also found it interest to note that Kanye‚Äôs mom died the last time Jupiter was in Sag. Many think his latent mental illnesses were worsened by her death and ultimately laid the groundwork for the woefully flawed personality we see before us now. A Jupiter cycle indeed. 

Runner up‚ÄîUranus in Taurus is also conjunct his Venus and Mars conjunction. Shake ups and eccentricity and sporadic direction galore. Specifically regarding the women in his life (forbidding make up for North, forbidding sexiness for  Kim). 

Kanye‚Äôs rising of Cancer is not rock solid. But if it were true, the moon in Pisces would be playing out in the 9th house of religion and spirituality (along with transit Neptune there now), and the Sun conj Jupiter in Gemini would be playing out in the 12th house of psychic trauma, undoing and mental illness. Plus transit Saturn and Pluto would be in his 7th, explaining his tightened reigns around the relationships in his life. We don‚Äôt know his birth time for sure but this sure lines up...

Astrology is fun! ‚ú®üåö

426,hia78b,False,Discussion/Debate ,112,The 12th House. Thoughts?,astrology,"The 12th House: House of Hidden Enemies

Like the 7th house, the 12th house can show the types of enemies we encounter based on a lack of self awareness. The 7th house shows open enemies projected from our identity (1st house). The 7th house is felt interpersonally, whereas the 12th house is felt collectively. The 12th house shows hidden enemies reflected from parts of ourselves that we have abandoned and forgotten. The sign and planets that land in the 12th house can show parts of ourselves that have been deprived, damaged, and abandoned in childhood. It shows where we weren‚Äôt given proper attention and acknowledgment. Because of this, we abandon ourselves, making these traits overshadowed by the collective. The expression of signs and planets in the 12th House can be weakened due to this. When we don‚Äôt give ourselves the proper attention and solitude our 12th house needs, we can almost feel enveloped and lost in other people‚Äôs energy. Tapping into our 12th house requires complete solitude and connection to the divine source, without external validation ‚Äì this is the only way we can truly see ourselves. 

Aries/Mars in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to assert yourself, express anger and maintain your independence. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs anger, making it difficult to understand your own anger and instinct. 

Taurus/Libra/Venus in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your worth, your appearance, and your ability to be seen as an equal within partnerships. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs demands, possessions and physical appearances, making it difficult to understand your own self-worth and standing within a relationship. 

Gemini/Virgo/Mercury in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your intellect, ability to communicate and freely express yourself. You feel overshadowed by other people talking over you or criticizing you, making it difficult to clearly articulate and express yourself. 

Cancer/Moon in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your sense of safety, comfort, and emotional expression. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs emotions and neediness, making it difficult to clearly understand your emotions and how you really feel about things. 

Leo/Sun in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to shine and be seen. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs ego expression and need for attention, making it difficult to acknowledge yourself and let yourself be seen by others.

Scorpio/Pluto in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to transform and face darkness. You feel overshadowed by the bad in other people and their darkness/shadow energy, making you fearful in facing your own darkness and transforming from it. 

Sagittarius/Jupiter in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your beliefs, knowledge and ability to be free. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs freedom and ability to encounter luck, making it difficult for you to find courage in yourself to take leaps of faith at the right moments.

Capricorn/Saturn in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your ability to have authority, create structure and leadership qualities. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs authority, making it difficult for you to take a leadership role or climb up the ladder within traditional settings. 

Aquarius/Uranus in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your eccentricity and ability to connect with communities/friends. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs unique qualities making it difficult to find your individuality amongst the collective. 

Pisces/Neptune in the 12th house: Hidden enemies seem to attack your empathic abilities and ability to fantasize. You feel overshadowed by other people‚Äôs deception and fantasies, making it difficult to differentiate your own from others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/hia78b/the_12th_house_thoughts/,241,Astrology is fake nonsense for idiots. ,2020-06-29 22:16:51

1.  **Face the Truth**: Has there been a situation in your life you have been turning a blind eye to? Neptune likes to keep the blinders over our eyes but since it‚Äôs Retrograde in its home sign of Pisces it is ripping off your glasses and pushing you straight into the sunlight. It may seem intense at first, but you can no longer hide how you feel about a person/situation any longer. Change is scary, but nothing is scarier than staying stagnant because it may be rough for an undisclosed amount of time. If you think back, weren‚Äôt you always happy you chose change over comfort?  


2.  **Tap into your spiritual side**: It‚Äôs time to take a hold of your anxiety and show it who is boss. Don‚Äôt try to fight these feelings but rather observe them and see what you can do to soothe yourself until the feeling passes. Meditate, ground yourself in nature, be present in the moment, get to know yourself again.  


3.  **Turn your vision into reality:** Neptune has been direct since November 27, 2019. How many of your promises have you kept to yourself? Have you worked on your dreams or even acknowledged them? Have you cut through subconscious thoughts and limiting beliefs? It is now time to look at your progress and make the necessary changes to heal and build your vision.

There is no much mistery about, I can resume in 3 rules.

- Don't lie to me. I don't like to lose time, have in mind that I'll try to love you. So be yourself. Don't try to impressionate me, I want to love you, cooperate. 

- I'm extremely monogamic, so don't cheat/betray me. I'm pretty much into anything that doesn't hurt this rule (everything has limits, and I don't want to use your toys). I'm yours, you're mine. Sound possessive, but I don't want control you, that's kinda much because in essence what turn me on is duality, duo, the couple idea. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Tristan and Isolde, I love the idea of partnership in love. So clingy girls makes me turned on. Well... Be ready if you are into me and is clingy... 

- Take responsibility for yourself. Or don't make me guilty for things that aren't actually my fault. Basically if something in me makes you feel bad indirectly, don't act like I'm guilty on your inner trauma. Ofc, I care a lot about how you feel, but I care even more about what makes you feel like that, so I won't be condecending. We'll talk and I'll try to understand you, help you and work on it with you. But you need to be honest with me and say me the truth on preference in a objective way, draw if necessary. If something makes you feel bad, I'll try destroy it at once. I want to protect you, so I think that act as a Terminator sometimes is good for that... Hasta l√° vista. 

If you're genuinely kind, you got 20% on way. 

Also, idc much about your body, you can looks like Jinx, Illaoi or Miss Fortune, just avoid be obese or anorexic, I'm not superman and neither want to break you. If you give me what I've wrote above I'll suck you mostly every day, just have hygienic habits, spend in soap, not in make up.

450,c58mwr,False,None,21,The Houses in Astrology,astrology,"The houses give you even more information about your planetary placements by revealing the sectors of life in which these planets are likely to manifest. The houses look like slices of pizza, and each slice represents an arena of life.

A brief explanation of what each of the houses represent:

**1st house The Ascendant / Rising Sign**  \-  identity, body, self and appearance.

**2nd house -** possessions, values and money that you earn.

**3rd house -** communication, siblings, third house, short distance travel.

**4th house / IC** \- home, family, emotional state.

**5th house** \- romance, entertainment, children, creativity.

**6th house** \- health, daily routines, service.

**7th house / Descendant** \- one to one contacts, business partnerships, marriage.

**8th house -** shared resources, intimacy, death.

**9th house -** travel, learning, spirituality.

**10th house / Midheaven** \- professional career, reputation, public persona.

**11th house -** friends, groups, organizations, hopes and dreams.

**12th house -** subconscious, dream world, what is hidden.

So each sector is a certain arena of life, but I like to think of them as landlords. Think of the planets as tenants within the landlord‚Äôs property. The landlord informs the going-ons of the property, but the planet is actually doing the action, living in that house. The planet, or tenant, answers to the landlord in terms of how that house operates. If the landlord does not have any tenants currently in the property, the house is owned and operated by the landlord. So if you have an empty house within your pizza pie of your chart, fear not. It does not mean that sector of life is a reality for you - simply that the landlord takes command of the tasks of the house. For more information on how you approach the affairs of that house, you would look to the planet on the cusp of the house, follow that sign‚Äôs planetary ruler and look at what that planet is doing.

So for example, if Libra is the sign that rules your 2nd house, you would follow Libra‚Äôs planetary ruler - Venus - for more information about how you approach finances and possessions. Look to your natal Venus condition, aspects and house location for more information about how you approach money and value within your life.

We look to houses to better understand how our natal planet is operating. Where your planets are located will alter how it functions. Take two natives who both have Venus, the planet of love, beauty and pleasure, in Taurus. Yet one has an ascendant in Leo, so the Venus falls within their 10th house of career, public persona and reputation. This will manifest their Venus in a mainly professional environment, perhaps working in a career that involves beauty, aesthetics or design and being known for their harmonious, beauty-seeking eye. Yet the other native has an Aquarius rising, so Venus in Taurus falls in the 4th house of home, family and emotional state, which will likely manifest as harmonious relationships with family or an eye for home decor. Same placement, yet different houses influence **where** in life those Venusian tendencies will be filtered through.

So when you look to your chart, look at which houses have a strong concentration for you. If you have three or more planets having a party within one of the slices of pizza, or houses, you have what is called a stellium. Think of houses with lots of planets as a sector of life with lots of emphasis for you and where lots of growth will take place - so if you have 3 or more planets concentrated in your 6th house, for example, expect lots of soul growth  to come from the arena of health, daily routines, service and working.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/c58mwr/the_houses_in_astrology/,229,Yumm I just had pizza hut today ,2019-06-25 13:34:04

483,fokze6,False,Western,40,Thought I'd share this reading from Astro Matrix. It's about the world going through a material change (Uranus in Taurus) within the next 6 years.,astrology,"
Uranus then re-enters Taurus on March 6, where it will remain until 2025‚Äì26. Financial systems and food production may be in for a shock, since Uranus can bring instability, but this may be necessary to shake us from our complacency. On a personal level, many of us are looking for an improvement in our values and attitudes towards money and the methods we use to survive.

Uranus and Taurus are an interesting combination to attempt to fathom. Taurus the sign that, out of the entire zodiac, is the most resistant to change meets the planet that insists upon it. Uranus challenges the status quo and forces both the individual and society to change and, in particular, to break from the past. From the purely Uranian point of view, clinging to the past can only hinder progress. From the deliberate, enduring, and persistent Taurean viewpoint, change not only might topple the much-beloved quiet life, it also threatens the most important thing of all: security.

A dynamic square aspect between these two highly energized planets on May 16. Forecasts for the Uranus in Taurus years (May 2017 through April 2026) include financial upheaval, radical environmental changes, and a revolution in how we handle the planet‚Äôs resources. Uranus last traveled through Taurus from June 1934 to May 1942; in 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act and the Social Security Act, both of which significantly altered how U.S. citizens handled their savings. It also saw¬†the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936), Japan‚Äôs invasion of China (1937), the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland (1939), and much activity from Nazi Germany, with finally the outbreak of World War II in 1939. From a Uranus in Taurus point of view, many of these happenings changed borders; land ownership changed hands. The way in which land was used also changed in several European countries.

¬†Uranus in Taurus might well deliver all sorts of changes to various economic systems, but perhaps more interesting will be the changes in how we use our resources; how we use, make, and spend our money and what we spend it on. With Uranus, we know to expect more technology in the making and spending¬†of money.

The ingress of an outer planet into a new sign often coincides with major world events. The very day that Uranus entered Aries (March 11, 2011), an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, triggering the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

¬†Uranus in Taurus does give rise to individuals feeling that they are trapped by debt and that money is not offering them the freedom they would like, this could create tremendous growth in so-called sharing economies, or what some people call ‚Äúcollaborative consumerism‚Äù ‚Äî the idea being that individuals can rent out their car, their bike, their apartment, their computer, almost anything, when they are not using it.
With Uranus entering Taurus, in addition to possible Earth changes, we could see shake-ups in the financial world. Disruptors of the financial status quo are already at play and likely to gain traction: cryptocurrencies, micro-banking, crowdfunding. We may see grassroots movements to free humanity from the control of the banking system, and free the Earth from an economy based on extracting and exploiting resources. On a personal level, we could become aware of the ways we feel restricted when it comes to money, and take steps toward liberation. Relationships and sexuality are also ripe for revolution, and we can expect trends like polyamory, ethical non-monogamy and sacred sexuality to continue to rise",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fokze6/thought_id_share_this_reading_from_astro_matrix/,210,"Didn't we have a sexual revolution in the sixties?  Then the soaring divorce rates of the 1970's Then the plague of HIV/AIDS in the 1980's. Then the availability of internet porn since the late 1990's.  I'm sick of sexual revolution.  I think that we could stay settled down for a couple of more decades.

I'd love to see Uranus in Taurus slow everything down for a few years; to let us all catch our collective breath. ",2020-03-25 05:38:34

502,acks3c,False,None,59,"What Each Rising Sign Can Expect from the Capricorn Solar Eclipse Today, Tomorrow",astrology,"**Eclipse Prescriptions: New Moon in Capricorn January 5th-6th 2019**

*(If you don't know your Rising Sign, read from the POV of your Sun Sign if born during day, Moon Sign if born during night. Keep in mind these themes may be applicable for the next year and a half, as eclipses light up the Capricorn-Cancer axis in your chart.)*

**Aries**: Big one for you Aries. Happening in your angular 10th house of career and status, this eclipse can bring about monumental change in the work you do in the world and how you are seen, received and praised for it. It may have the power to catapult you into success, so long as you have the Capricorn work ethic and integrity to back it up and don‚Äôt stop short to start something else. Otherwise, an eclipse here may teach you to be a bit more methodical about your work in the world, going about it with backbreaking diligence, and learning to find success through the accomplishments of smaller goals that accumulate over time. It will call for an organization of your efforts and an attention to the details of your dreams. In some cases, you may experience a breakthrough or breakdown with a boss/mentor/father-like figure. Or even a sudden change wherein you are the boss or have the final say. But do not despair, anything that seems to fall apart here is creating space for something better to take its place. With transit Saturn and Pluto already here, this eclipse will give you the energy to eliminate or make you aware of useless endeavors. And to move forward onto the world stage with the part you‚Äôre meant to play, and the power of conviction to know you‚Äôre making the right choices. 

&#x200B;

**Taurus**: The eclipse in your 9th house, dear Taurus, represents a new vantage point through which to view your beliefs and your ingrained ideologies. Perhaps a gateway will open up, allowing those things foreign to you and your experience to settle in and teach you new ways. Movement in the 9th house always confronts what you believe to be true. Where you are rigid in your spiritual or religious pursuits, the eclipse may ask for flexibility. Where you lack follow-through in these areas, then discipline. Where can the altars of your mind be dusted off, where can new magic seep in? It may be that your worldview needs more scope, so that it can expand and change as you grow. This may be done, perhaps, through travel or committing to higher education. But whether your trips are internal or external, this eclipse dusts off your proverbial suitcase, asking what deserves to travel with and inform you on this journey of life. Bon voyage!

&#x200B;

**Gemini**: The Capricorn partial Solar Eclipse will be happening in your 8th house of joint resources, shared belongings, intimacy and occult matters. This eclipse will enlighten within you new ways to ask for what you need, share what you have and start confronting any financial issues (debt, inheritances, scholarships, savings, deeds, loans, etc.) that are stopping you from living comfortably. The eclipse will ask you to set new goals and intentions in these areas, and commit to correcting them with dutiful action. Issues of worth don‚Äôt only pertain to our physical or monetary possessions, but also the worth of our stories, our pain, our trauma, and how when shared, they become transformed. Our most intimate bonds are those in which we reveal layers of ourselves with others, transmuting vulnerability into a super power. The eclipse here may bring to the forefront intimacy issues you have with others (or yourself), where you may have one foot out of the door instead of fully committing to being seen. In Capricorn, this is practical. We share our stories with those who deserve to hear them, and over time, strengthen our trust in these areas. 8th house is also said to be rich with mystery, sometimes a conduit to otherworldly matters. Set up a shrine, hold a crystal, meditate on a thought or intention, and open yourself up to communication from your cosmic companions.

&#x200B;

**Cancer**: This partial Solar Eclipse will place emphasis on your 7th house of relationships with others. Relationships can be business, romantic, or platonic in nature. With Saturn and Pluto already firmly planted here, you may have found your relationships challenging or requiring that you grow beyond ingrained patterns. You may have even found that you‚Äôve been attracted to powerful and consequential people who irritate your more soft sensibilities. This eclipse is a New Moon, and in your relationship house, opens up a portal through which you can experience your relationships differently, out from power struggles and into feeling empowered. New Moons can also bring in new things, so you may even expect to attract alliances that are more in line with the power you are coming into now and the person you want to be. It is very influential to have an eclipse happening in an angular house, so you more than most signs can expect to feel this eclipse more strongly. Commit to building powerful and productive relationships, and sweeping away the old and tired dynamics tying you to any drama in this area.

&#x200B;

**Leo**: In your 6th house, the Solar Eclipse wants you to think about your routines, your service, and your health. What perfunctory actions are you taking out of blind duty? Do they actually add to your life? Does your service actually serve you? Where are the lapses in your health? To be of service to the world, you must be in service to yourself, and tweak the ways you relate to your body. Build a routine where all aspects of your life and body are served and respected for the jobs they do and the jobs they help you get done. Eliminate the wasteful, non intentional action. Stop going through the motions, and live instead with intention and focus on health in all areas. Where you may tip toe into doing more for others or be in anxiety about how much needs to be done (which transit Pluto and Saturn can trigger) this eclipse brings back into perspective the need for self-care. Associated with perfection, the eclipse in your 6th wants you to define what perfect is to you. A job well done, and a body well tended for, no matter how it looks, is perfection enough. Build these muscles over time and you can style your life into a more fitting lifestyle. 

&#x200B;

**Virgo**: Your 5th house of pleasure, children, sex, creativity and joy will be getting the cosmic vibrations of this Solar Eclipse. You may have been hard on yourself here, restricting the flow of joy, finding it hard to be uniquely who you are, or facing stumbling blocks on the way to expressing yourself or your creativity. The eclipse can open up wellsprings within you, wherein words, ideas, or indulgent activities come pouring forth. Nothing in Capricorn is superfluous, so you can expect that your brilliant ideas here will have ramifications in other areas of your life, truly taking hold and helping you redefine who you thought you were. The call here is to build fun and flow into your daily life and into your identity. In time, these changes and creations could even make you popular in groups, communities and the world at large. But start first with the audience that really matters: yourself. 

&#x200B;

**Libra**: You are another sign that will be feeling this Solar Eclipse a bit more strongly than others. In your 4th house, this eclipse is all about revamping your domestic structures, be them your actual home, or the people and places that you call home. You may feel changes opening up for you in terms of where you live, or may experience changes through the happenings of others in your family unit. The eclipse may want you to build better roots and foundations, and the places and people therein, that truly support you. Are there members in your family that bring you down? Or ones you need to let in more? Or is there a living situation with a roommate or friend that could be better or changed? You may literally move, or set your sights on a move later, or else energetically move to find the roots in your life‚Äîthe people, things, places, activities that hold you down and anchor you. Time to find and be selective about your tribe. Your resting place is your nesting place‚Äîand this eclipse wants a solid place to hatch.

&#x200B;

**Scorpio**: In your 3rd house, this Solar Eclipse can bring about news, information and communication from others/siblings that will be vital to your progress. Whether you experience a sudden insight, or you hear truths coming from others, this eclipse wants you to adjust how you communicate and how you express your ideas. You may even find yourself changing long-held ideas, or endeavoring upon new ways to learn about subjects that interest you. New perceptions and new ways of seeing things are paramount, so keep your mind open‚Äîthey may inform your way forward. The eclipse wants to further build upon these new mental machinations, making sure what you think and say (and therefore feel) are in alignment with your beliefs about life and yourself. You may even need strength to communicate things to others that you‚Äôve otherwise held in (Saturn). The eclipse gives you this opening, asking that you be more rigorous with your truth-telling and with the information you allow to settle in your mind. This eclipse may also throw a wrench in your every day environments, asking you to strengthen your adaptability, and behold new ways of maneuvering your communities. 

&#x200B;

**Sagittarius**: Mind on your money and money on your mind. This eclipse is highlighting 2nd house issues of material possessions and concepts of security and worth. Your relationship to you bank account or the way you define material success is up for scrutiny here. Where you feel insufficient or insecure are the places that most need your attention. This eclipse asks you to make strong where you feel weak, so that you have a solid ground on which to accumulate, collect, enjoy and behold. You may change how you are making money, either through different income streams or through budgeting. You may even come into financial gain, one that asks you to nourish and take care of it so that it may multiply. Any lack you feel here becomes the empty space on which to intentionally call in more. Our immaterial worlds also need enriching. Where are your under-valuing yourself? Where can your self-esteem use a boost? This isn‚Äôt a quick pick me up, but an invitation to construct a formidable dignity and love of self. In Capricorn, this confidence comes with work, but stands to serve you for the rest of your life.  

&#x200B;

**Capricorn**: Of course you know this Solar Eclipse is a big one in terms of your identity and how you wish to come off to the world. In your 1st house, this eclipse is inviting you to overhaul old identities which no longer serve you and step into ones more in alignment with your path. No one gets to stay the same forever, and you more than most signs are acutely aware of the passing of time. Have you outgrown the skin you‚Äôre in? Are you ready for a new vessel through which to experience life? The first house is also known as a house of health, so match your evolving identity, to yourself and to the world, with a physical forms that can support it. With Pluto and Saturn already here, you have been in a period of excavation, reforming and rebuilding your personality, how you interface with the world. Over the next year and a half, and starting with this eclipse, mold this mask with grace and intention, no matter how rough the going gets or how painful it is to say goodbye to who and what you were. Steadfast, goat. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. But it ruled the world. 

&#x200B;

**Aquarius**: Happening in your 12th house, this eclipse may begin one of many spiritual insights or awakenings for you. In this house, lunar and solar properties are hidden from our awareness, making this eclipse more fundamental to your psyche and unconscious processes. Any psychic muck or deeply entrenched emotions will be activated, so that they may be acknowledged, so that they may be healed. You may also find yourself deeply sensitive to the needs, emotions and motivations of others, as the wellsprings here are lined with the unconscious undulations that connect all of humanity. 12 housers can be some of our most profound teachers and artists, so you may expect to feel wiser after this series of eclipses, more in tune with the world around you. There could be urges towards isolation, research, or other rabbit holes of your making, even travels to faraway lands. The goal is not to lose yourself here, but to become more yourself through the consolidation of your ethereal worlds with your material ones.

&#x200B;

**Pisces**: In your 11th house, opportunities are abound for building your social networks in ways that work for your future. It is also a ripe time to evaluate those friends and communities that serve your goals and hopes. If there has been a hard fought road to be recognized in your career or social circles, now may begin the admiration or awards for your work and talents. For some, there may be a revaluation of your long-term dreams, and the people you are choosing to be a part of that. This eclipse may open up for you new groups of people to commune with. There is momentum in numbers, so you may join new clubs, associations, or otherwise surround yourself with the likeminded people who will feed your passions and respect your skills. New friends, new allies. This is a public and social time, perhaps catapulting you into positions of relative fame or prominence. You may have to learn how to work a room, and present yourself and your accomplishments in ways the world can take seriously. But either way, so begins the reaping of rewards from the company you keep.

508,fe3eia,False,None,27,JoJo (Singer) And the Blessing of the Saturn Return.,astrology,"Edit: Posted this on Twitter and JoJo read and responded! She found it fascinating and loves astrology ü•∞‚ú®


Random but it had to be written. UPROXX recently uploaded a short documentary on JoJo and it resonated so well with what I saw in her chart, rated AA. 

At 13, JoJo experienced massive success (2nd house profection year, hers ruled by expansive Jupiter, which trines her MC--more on that later), but was subsequently held hostage by a greedy (and now defunct) music label. As a result, she couldn't release music for more than a decade.

JoJo is an Aquarius Rising, and her Saturn is at 24 degrees of Capricorn, placing it in the 12th. When the ruling planet of the ASC is averse or ""hidden"" from the ASC, a theme of ""delay"" can prevail, as the steersman of your ship cannot see where it is going. Very frustrating. In JoJo's case, it is further compounded by the fact that her ASC ruler *is* the planet of delay and restriction. And that is further compounded by the fact that its a 12th house placement of loss. Whew!

In the midst of recording additional songs, her label dissolved (12th), yet she was still bound (Saturn) by the terms in her contract. She continued to record music but was not allowed to release any of it. **We need to note that JoJo has a massive 12th house Capricorn stellium--Mercury RX, Venus, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus and NN.** That she was forced into relative obscurity reinforces 12th house themes of things hidden, things ending, doing things in secret. Music studios are also the 12th house--forced creative isolation. She remarked in the documentary that she would constantly read articles that proclaimed she must have died. She recalled how frustrating it was to see musicians who started after her start to pass and out-succeed her. (Personally, this is such a huge Saturn struggle. It is the bane of my existence. Anyway....)

JoJo has Neptune and Venus closely conjunct in the 12th. In the documentary, she was gaslit into taking medication to make her thinner, under the guise that her label just wanted her to be ""healthy"". The fogginess of Neptune playing out next to her creative planet, Venus, is also indicative of being sold a bill of goods that never comes to be. In the beginning, she was very glamourized by Hollywood, private jets, opening for Usher, etc.--but when the fog settled, she was completely and utterly screwed by signing that contract: Mercury RX in the 12th. RX Mercury begs of you to dive into the details, to double check, to be sure, transit or natal. And music contracts are complicated and obtuse already. Placed in the 12th, she became a victim of her own pen. (Not blaming her, by the way.)

What ensued were years of substance abuse, another 12th house theme, especially with Venus ad Neptune co present. Unable to release or perform music, JoJo became ""a shell of herself"" and had to be ""buzzed"" in order to function. Only the realization that her dad was an addict (who died of his addiction it seemed--went to sleep and never woke up) snapped her back into reality, and she begun to take control. She hired a lawyer and became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with her former label. Her Venus, in the 12th and conj. Neptune, rules her 9th house Libra of contracts, law, legal endeavors. So she was in for an uphill battle. But she has Mars square her ASC, which, yes, can render one a victim to martial energies from others (her label), but also energizes you for battle as a result. In Taurus, it also meant/means she has to fight for her art. 

In the meantime, she decided to release free mixtapes. A Saturn theme is stripping down to bare essentials. Ideally wanting to release music for profit, she had to settle for releasing music for free, and self-funding a lot of her creative endeavors. Though not firmly in her Saturn Return when she released these mixtapes, Saturn themes prevail for as it is her final dispositor. 

Anyway, the story gets happier. In 2014, she was freed from her contract. It was a 12th house profection year, and during Capricorn season. So matters of the 12th house were doubly activated. And Saturn lurked still behind it all. Mars trine Saturn natives also never give up no matter how steep the odds are stacked. Go JoJo!

*""Just imagine how the free bird will sing after being caged for so long,""* wrote one reporter. Holy 12th house! Only now, instead of entering a prison, she was leaving it. And thus began a new cycle for her, as she entered a 1st house year soon after. She signed to Atlantic Records. 

Despite being away for almost a decade, JoJo still had very loyal fans. During her legal battles ""#FreeJoJo"" was used on social media as a means of support for the singer, and many media outlets and blogs publicized her struggle. Fans and celebrities alike stood in solidarity. And when she was finally able to tour and release music again--she sold out shows, was streamed/downloaded tens of millions of times, soared to #1 on iTunes, and recouped all her expenses. Why? Sun and MC in the 11th house in Sag, ruled *and* trined by benefic Jupiter in Leo in her 7th. The 11th house describes the nature of our fans and friends. Though a ""victim"" of her business relationships early on, Jupiter in the 7th and ruling the 11th ensured JoJo would *always* have support from others. It also ensured that her public image, career, and reputation would always remain afloat and gifted positivity and expansion. The Sun and Jupiter also have mutual reception, each in the sign that the other rules. That's a wonderful tag-team to have by yourself to mediate the 12th house loss. Jupiter and Sun inflate you up again---and again and again. Jupiter also rules her second house so: money.

As her Saturn Return started, JoJo re-recorded and re-released her first albums, as her former label removed all of her music from the Internet. Having to go back and re-do everything, and with precision and perfection, (Mercury RX) is Saturnian, but JoJo found it extremely cathartic. She also changed some of the lyrics to reflect that she was in her late 20s now, and not an adolescent. Saturn as ruler of time and maturity.

As her Saturn Return became exact in early 2020, JoJo won her first GRAMMY for a comeback single released in 2019. She went on to be nominated for several other awards, and is slated for bigger things in the future. She announced a new album and tour for Spring 2020.

Whew, won't Saturn do it y'all! After he hits you with 2 by 4 after 2 by 4.

I hope this is reflection for people with heavy 12th house, and retrogrades, and heavy Saturn. Or people just curious/afraid of the Saturn Return. Mine is exact today so I found JoJo's story extremely resonate and because I'm also a trapped musician with Saturn in aversion to the ASC. Yes, shit does end up sucking hard---but never forever. And usually for the better. Saturn came back around for JoJo and as a result, all the planets in the 12th were loosened up to express more freely, retribution was delivered, debts were paid and money was flowing, and most importantly, life purpose was solidified and confirmed. 

p.s. One of her collaborators noted that she had a wise soul trapped inside the body of a young girl. Apropos for Saturn dominate people.

509,b3q32p,False,None,56,Husband bought a computer during mercury retrograde,astrology,"For about a year my husband has been borrowing my computer and I finally put my foot down last week as he can afford and needs a computer of his own. I was cranky and worried he would break my new computer which he can not afford to replace. 

I did not expect him to go out and buy one the next day but that's what he did. I told him he should wait for mercury to go direct and I would help him but he's not too into astrology...or wasn't until now. He is a Taurus rising so a bit stubborn about asking for help. 

The first computer had a cracked screen that was not noticeable until he turned it on at home. He went back to the store for an exchange, but they were out of that model. So he got a different model for the same price. 

The second computer has this horrible, very bad, nearly fascist OS called Windows 10 Mode S. Mode S means you can only install programs from the Microsoft store, which is useless. So he went back today to complain and got a refund and went to another store. 

At the new store he described exactly what he needs and specified no Mode S. The sales rep recommended a new model with Windows 10, no Mode S on the box. 

He got home and the third computer is also Mode S. He is not happy. 

At this point I feel bad for not letting him borrow my computer until the 25th so have offered to buy him a Chromebook myself...after Mercury goes direct.

516,elgw3n,False,None,78,Things I‚Äôve noticed about Virgo risings,astrology,"- literally looks like a baby was given bone structure, always have a petite face but their cheekbones and jaws and eyebrow bones are defined?

- major self analysis, but with Leo 12th their ego is hidden, so struggle with discovering who they are. However Leo 12th gives extra clarity on their on subconscious and understanding their faults.

- look clean, perfected and well read 

- Pisces descendant, MESSY AS HELL!! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs your bedroom, dishes or organisational skills, but something is SO. MESSY. Lucky your rising hides that lmao

- always in their heads, need to learn to use their eye for detail and planning to orchestrate their dreams (Pisces)

- resting. bitch. face.

- friends/people with Leo placements that fall into their 12th house will usually be people/interests hidden away from others. E.g, if you have a Leo placement boyfriend, others won‚Äôt even know about him/you‚Äôll keep him private/people won‚Äôt know he‚Äôs a big part of your life.

- there‚Äôs something about the types of partners Virgo risings attract because of that Pisces descendant, like the partners romanticise/idealise you because you are ‚Äúperfect‚Äù (Virgo) to them (Pisces)

- This is super specific but: Some Virgo risings dont like to be touched/hugged all the time and here‚Äôs why: Virgo risings will have a Cancer 11th house‚Äî3 of my Virgo rising friends had to be incubated/needed special treatment at birth: being healed/taken care of instead of your mother. 11th house is also associated with robots/electronics when Cancer is in a a house far away from the 1st house, indicating distance between the mother/child after you were born.

COVID-19 and Uranus in Taurus,astrology,"I just realized another manifestation of Uranus in Taurus is the radically different ways the food supply chain and food experience has been damaged due to COVID during this crisis. But more importantly: we will never eat or dine out the same way again. 

The food industry I‚Äôm speaking to includes everything from stronger unionization among workers to mom and pop restaurants/groceries falling under with only the chains thriving to the fact that we are never going to eat at a restaurant without large spaces between tables and/or masks. What are legit chefs going to do? They can‚Äôt prepare food with gloves. 

The Guardian ran a piece proclaiming that only the most ‚Äúadaptable‚Äù restaurants will survive.

These are all fundamental Uranian archetypes. The lightening bolt of change, the revolution around how we value people, where money goes, and the realization that the future will look nothing like the past. 

Also: the beauty industry (Taurus) is taking a large hit. Nail salons, hair salons, massage and wellness places, make up artists‚Äîthe future is so uncertain. Hell even tenants refusing to pay rent fits this general trend of material and financial disruption. Square from Saturn ain‚Äôt helpful

532,bc68th,False,None,145,Need help explaining Secret astrology files found in my PC,astrology,"My father passed away a few months ago, he was very close to his brother, who was an amazing astrologer, spoke 9 languages, was weird AF. Loved him like a second father. 

His death was shrouded in Mystery. He tried killing himself, because he ""found something that the mankind is not ready for"" and when my father accidentally visited him at his house, found him at the brink of death, saved him. Everything he ever worked on was burned, destroyed. When he regained consciousness, he said to me ""It is no matter, I will die anyway, I have found things, we are not ready for"".  We ran tests on him after his overdose to see if everything was OK. We found a tumor, very aggressive, he died in a few weeks, maybe a month or two later. 

There were many unexplained things about my uncle, at his deathbed, he made me PROMISE to NEVER EVER look into astrology, not even for fun. and never chase after his work. me and my father shared a PC, we had two seperate Windows and I knew his password, but he didn't know I did. 

Before he died, I must have searched for these ""secret"" files on the PC, since 2008 - I couldn't find one bit of document. not ONE SINGLE THING.

&#x200B;

It was February 1st, 2019, I got a huge overwhelming nostalgia, I wanted to look for my uncles pictures, his documents and memos in this PC. I don't know why. 

I found things. A LOT OF THINGS (!) I cannot share all of them, it seems DANGEROUS to do so for a lot of reasons. 

February 1st, 1950 was my uncles birthday, as I later found out.

This is an excerpt from one of the documents, titled: ETLI. Our wifi name was Etli, it means nothing in my language, nothing in English, but here's the part of that doc: 

&#x200B;

""   

""**ETLI**"" - bureau of astrological prognostication is at the same time movable center of cosmic antropoecology and Trinital Astrology, where, prefigurative, prototypical and paragonal method of prognostication ""**Pollux**"" was elaborated.

Generally, ""**Pollux**"" is the scientific method for analysis, calculation and prognostication of behavior of big, complex interactive systems. Such scheming and forecasting take place in the system of cosmic polarities (permanent codes-cyphers of universe). Developing-events of man or any other system (state, organization, team) are entirely ruled by eternal cosmic, universal codes-cyphers. Their deduction and determination gives possibility to connect in one trajectory of development existing-events of above mentioned systems and their prefigurative prototypical prognostication. In this case subjects of prediction are not concrete life events, but type or class they belong, because future, expected events are realizing only in general, blunt contours and marks, while details and concrete forms of their revealing and exposition remains entirely in authority of man's and subject's administration. And this gives us the chance to bring such correction in present, which consequently stir up necessary changes in future i.e. purposely plan this last one.""

552,bf0qap,False,None,73,In Celebration of the Aries Season...,astrology,"Let‚Äôs do some fun facts about our beloved rams to close the season off:

Aries (mostly Sun, Mars, Moon, Rising) could give a fuck what anyone thinks about them, they‚Äôll do what they want. Unlike most other signs, they are uninhibited by social standards and will do and say things that will shock others because of how raw and uncensored they are. 

Aries love to laugh! Leo‚Äôs are known to laugh a lot, but Aries is up there too. Especially if you have Sun in Aries or Aries in 5th house. They seem super serious at first glance (especially the men) so this catches ppl off guard.

Aries, along with Sags and Leos, can make the room burst with laughter. Though, all the fire signs have different ways of making people laugh. When an Aries tells jokes, their brutal honesty and slapstick is what makes them so funny. Sun in Aries/Aries in 5th house can make fun of themselves a lot! 

You can‚Äôt censor an Aries. They will eventually speak up and won‚Äôt even consider the consequences. 

Aries may be heartbreakers, but they‚Äôll never, ever lie or play games with you. They‚Äôll tell you what they want right from the beginning. They literally have no time to waste trying to keep up a lie.

You will never see an Aries involved in drama for too long. These people shut shit down as soon as they see something that needs addressing. They are known for ‚Äúsolving‚Äù conflicts immediately after becoming aware of them. 

...but the way they solve conflicts are by being violent, brash, and loud. but hey, it is the fastest way to solve em! (Mars, Rising, Mercury and sun in Aries most likely)

When an Aries fails, they get pissed, but oddly energized at the same time. They truly see failure as an opportunity to grow and learn. These people are very positive.

An Aries (especially the men) will look you in the eye for a very long time and it‚Äôll be very unsettling. Aries know they can come across this way, but they don‚Äôt want to appear weak, so they‚Äôll keep staring!

If you stare back, they‚Äôll have a tremendous amount of respect for you. (Another reason why Leos and Aries are best buds)

They have firm handshakes. Even the women will have firm handshakes and will take you by surprise.

Contrary to popular belief, Aries, especially the men, are solitary by nature. Despite their energetic and extroverted nature, they don‚Äôt like being around a lot of people for a long period of time. It exhausts then. They love being by themselves which is why a lot of Aries are single.

Another unpopular fact, Aries don‚Äôt care about outside attention much. They‚Äôll put on a show, sure, but after it‚Äôs over, leave them alone. They‚Äôre not like Leos who love to bask in the attention. An Aries will love the compliments and the attention, but they can see through people who are just trying to kiss up to them. Not only that, but they‚Äôll feel like they have to move onto another thing they wanna do after awhile. 

Aries feels with great intensity. When happy, they jump for joy, when sad, they get on their knees and scream about how the world is so unfair, when mad... they end up paying for some damage.

Most of this is because they are the infants of the zodiac. Everything they feel is new to them, time and time again.

Because of this, Aries easily identifies with children. Probably a little bit too much; they sometimes even act like a kid. (Jumping on things they‚Äôre not supposed to be on, eating too fast and getting a stomach ache, laughing at inappropriate things, being unapologetically honest yet non malicious) more mature signs find themselves having to be a parent to an Aries and remind them to not say or do stupid things when in the moment.

Aries have this odd mixture of masculine and boyish/girly physical traits. Have you ever seen a guy who looks very manly but at the same time, boyish and childlike? Or maybe a very ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù looking lady who can also look really girly and young? Chances are you‚Äôve ran into an Aries! 

Aries love sports. Weightlifting, boxing, football, hockey, anything that has to do with putting their body under stress. They get a thrill out of it.

Speaking of which, Aries like pain if it means they are growing from it. 

Despite this, they hate pain they see as a waste of time and will be quite the baby about it. Dentists, getting shots, a pulled muscle, everyone hates these things but an Aries LOATHES them.

Aries listens to their body which is why so many of them are so healthy. They are in tune with their physical selves. 

Aries don‚Äôt feel fear until after the fact. Their impulsiveness tends to get them into a lot of hairy situations. 

Aries, when confronted, feel an exhilarating rush and in response, will do or say something that can easily escalate the confrontation. They can‚Äôt help it though, they feel so energized when shit gets real.

That being said, if this energy is misplaced, an Aries will find itself very, very anxious. Bordering on disorder levels. To avoid this, Aries should get a lot of exercise to have their energy flow evenly.

Aries (Leos too) are those people who are a little bit too happy at work. They can‚Äôt help it though; they love being productive. The way they see it, they could spend their day moping around doing nothing or spend it getting paid!

Aries are simply born to be. Leos were born to create, Scorpios were born to transform, libras were born to harmonize, but Aries? Aries are just here to exist. There‚Äôs no deep, complicated message behind Aries‚Äô existence. They‚Äôre just... here. 

Aries hate gossip. They always wonder why people complain instead of taking action and solving the issue. 

Don‚Äôt bring the ‚Äútea‚Äù to an Aries. They really don‚Äôt give a fuck and do not have time to waste listening about how bad your life is if you‚Äôre not making any effort to fix it yourself.

Aries love stories that are based around the underdog winning, tragic beginnings and happy endings, and people who keep moving forward no matter what life throws at them. Aries get hyped up just hearing about them!

Nobody will stick up for you like an Aries will. As long as you‚Äôre making efforts to better yourself and your life, an Aries will be your ride or die.

But if you‚Äôre lazing around not doing shit, don‚Äôt expect an Aries to care. 

Aries don‚Äôt play that passive aggressive shit. If it‚Äôs not worth you saying to their face, then why should it be worth Aries‚Äô time?

Aries men don‚Äôt talk much. They let their actions in life speak for them.

Aries women are more intimidating than the men because they aren‚Äôt afraid to get in your face. In fact, they may be LOOKING for conflict.

All Aries, even the men, have this sassy attitude about them. The men can flawlessly have this attitude while still remaining masculine. 

An Aries will observe your actions before they listen to your words. Despite their apparent gullibility, when focused on someone, they can be as discriminating and judgmental as a Scorpio. They just choose not to be most of the time because they believe everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt. Much like Scorpios, can easily see through bullshit. 

Aries are simple, not shallow. They won‚Äôt hang with people based on status and rank. They don‚Äôt kiss ass, quite the opposite really. They may even go out of their way to remind ppl of higher status that they are still a person who bleeds the same blood as them.

Aries will dine with Kings and vagabonds alike and will treat them the same too.

Aries always DO something with their feelings. When angry, they may punch a wall and go to the gym to lift to clear their heads. When sad, they may hit the books hard and get an A on an assignment. 

An Aries HATES wasting time.

The reason why Aries are so impatient and productive is because at one point in their past, they were really lazy and probably suffered the consequences of it. Now they go hard and won‚Äôt stop!

Aries love hard.

Aries have their heads so far up their own asses that they literally don‚Äôt even see other people. They need to be snapped out of it sometimes.

Aries sniffs their own farts. Not even joking.

If you‚Äôre trying to better your life, an Aries needs you as their companion. When they see others bettering themselves, not only will Aries push you and support you, but they will also take steps to making their lives better too.

Aries believe in the law of attraction. If you say it, it‚Äôll happen.

The worst thing you can say to an Aries is ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do anything‚Äù. Second worst is ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù.

The best thing you can say to an Aries is ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù

Because they rule the face, An Aries has a very expressive one. People can tell what they are feeling just based on their face.

Aries have gotten into so many quarrels that they think conflict and fights are apart of life. They‚Äôre right though!

Grab yourself an Aries today and tell them that they‚Äôve made amazing progress in their lives so far and that you have faith in them!!! The more sensitive ones will probably choke up a little bit. The tougher ones still won‚Äôt be able to hide their intense appreciation for what you said. 

If you genuinely support them 100%, an Aries will support you 110% and eliminate any obstacle that stands in your way.

The whole world could stand against an Aries, but if an Aries thinks he‚Äôs right, then he‚Äôs prepared to die.

It honestly doesn‚Äôt matter how many people stand in Aries‚Äô way, they will keep trying no matter what. They‚Äôd rather die than to give up on life.

Aries will keep falling and getting back up, again and again. 

Aries don‚Äôt care about your past! Make something of yourself now!

Aries don‚Äôt need your love. In fact, they may be too busy focusing on themselves to even notice you! ‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/bf0qap/in_celebration_of_the_aries_season/,184,"Aries are cool as long as they don't ""bully"" and they learn to control their temper.

This seems like a very stigmatized, overly simplified, uninteresting way of approaching the topic.  You're going to categorize caffeine, morphine, and LSD under the same energy?  I think it would be very interesting if we could be more concise.  For example, I think marijuana is very neptunian (also Venusian tho) because it really does cloud your mind in a very dreamy, creative way.  It allows you to think differently, more creatively and spontaneously, but then this can lead into delusions.  Obviously stimulants = mars.  What about psychedelics?  They expand your mind.  They just intensify every aspect of your psyche, your emotions become more intense, your thoughts race, and your true self becomes more apparent.  This sounds like Pluto.  Which is also fitting because psychedelics can drag you into the dark depths of your mind that you do NOT want to see unless you're ready.

565,hbfhjc,False,None,107,The Astrology of Sex Crimes ft. Danny Masterson (trigger warning),astrology,"He played Steven Hyde on That 70s Show, for reference. Also--apologies for the troublesome nature of this post, but I always look to see what is happening in the sky for these people when dramatic incidents take place. And here, hopefully the arc is towards justice for the women who alleged rape. Yesterday, June 17th, he was arrested. 

I always look to **Venus and the Moon** in the charts of men who domineer and commandeer women. His Venus and Moon stand in opposition, Aqua and Leo respectively. That places the emotional needs of the person at odds with how they value and love another person. There's a heavy dislike factor, sometimes, with these folks because they are so on the make to fulfill their own personal needs, that they fail to take care of the other. Why? Well the Moon is the more innately felt planet here. It is easy in a Moon-Anything oppostion to lean far too hard on the Moon side. In Masterson's case, he did so, with reprehensible results (allegedly). The Leo Moon propensity for being the star of any show, mostly private ones like within the family or within relationships or within the confines of hubris, can very well turn into acts of pride and power turned devious (allegedly).

His **Pisces Sun** rules over that Leo Moon. At least one of the women who alleged Masterson raped her said he did so by drugging her. This also all happened curiously over the backdrop of Scientology. Without incorrectly stating truths, Masterson himself was or is a practicing Scientologist, and one of his victims was or is as well. At least 3 of them were pressured to keep quiet by the Church of Scientology. So a very Piscean arena for darker Piscean themes.

Well, why now?

Curiously (aka Astrology is legit), the **South Node** has moved into Sagittarius. Sag, like it's Jupiter bro Pisces, has a lot to do with religion and dogma--Jupiter things. All over the world and likely with these women, all this is coming into light in a dramatic fashion in part because there is a drain happening around Sag things. Masterson has his Neptune in Sag, and while the SN will not conjunct that planet for a while (and when it does--what news will come with it?), it still does awaken a natal promise of that placement, sending some undulations into that part of his chart. Neptune the planet of drugging, religion, delusion. Also a planet that can think highly of itself within the context of organized religion. I AM the ONE and ONLY prophet--shush and listen. Stuff like that. Big drain over that shit now.

Now, the **North Node** is over Masterson's **Mars in Gemini**. Which, yep, means the SN is opposing it. Actions wrought facing their karmic resolution. His Mars in Gemini trines that Aqua Venus I spoke about above. Though trines get PR for harmony, please never forget that the seamlessness and easiness of the trine can get people into trouble. In this case, Masterson's ease with women, coercing them, getting them to do what he wanted--are all a part of this trine. Likely there was charm and magnetism involved, as he was a star on a hit television show back then. 

The **North Node** is also squaring his Pisces Sun. There is a change in direction happening in the development of his ego. The public cannot be privy to this, as it is more an internal function. But from the outside looking in, reckoning with rape allegations from decades ago seems like a major ingredient in ""Life Changes 101"".  The square engenders friction, challenge. Difficult events come up during this transit to chisel away at the intended direction of your life. 

**Neptune is in Pisces** right now, conjunct his Sun. This neatly ties up, to me, this Neptune story he has in his chart. Why? Well that natal Neptune in Sag squares his natal Sun, by sign. Now transit Neptune has caught up and is sitting on his Sun, rounding out in someway Neptunian themes as they have to do with ego development or in this case, ego DISSOLUTION. Nothing humbles a celebrity like being arrested. 

Couple more things...

Masterson's **NN is in Scorpio conjunct his Uranus**. Where is Uranus now? Opposing both of those planets. Uranus opposite Uranus is the midlife crisis aspect. The word ""crisis"" kind of says all it needs to say here. Maturation through difficult events. This is a wake up call for him. Youth is gone. Time to grow up. **Transit Uranus opposite his NN** also indicates a sudden change in direction, sudden events, and high wattage soul electrocution. I would like to extrapolate further that Uranus is in a Venus sign right now, likely causing a revolution in a sense regarding Venus industries and issues. This means this transit will awaken a lot with women's issues. Masterson's arrest is a microcosm of the macrocosm. 

Lastly, **Venus herself is RX**. Have you heard? Did you know? (Of course you did). This transit drudges up many long-forgotten Venus issues, or at least is asking of all of us to re-examine them. Without knowing the house this is happening in for Masterson, we can still bet that his arrest has something to do with the retrograde, as it is literally dragging up sexual incidents he has had with women from his past. In May, Venus stationed RX at 21 Gemini, conjunct Masterson's troublesome Mars.

570,a0mq58,False,None,31,Pay attention to ideas and intuitions happening in the next day,astrology,"Tomorrow (or tonight if you are in Europe), the inferior conjunction happens between Mercury retrograde and the sun.  A seed is planted at this time - pay attention to your thoughts and intuitions during this time (it actually starts on Nov. 27 at 4:15 am EST.)  Rest and recuperate.  Edit out the more extraneous components in work, thought, or lifestyle  now to leave room for the more currently relevant material that begins to surface after this point.

In other words, a new vision for the future emerges during the time of the inferior conjunction.  Be still and listen.  What is your unconscious making known to you that will be very important and lay the groundwork for a new future beginning when Mercury goes direct?  Some of you may already begin to see this new seed that is being planted right now.  It will become even clearer over the next day.

On Nov. 28, the Promethean Retrograde period begins and it will last until December 3.  This is period that, in my experience, gives Mercury retrograde such bad name.  So, now we have a new vision for the future.  But we can't act on it yet!  Here are some pieces of wisdom for navigating this time, from Erin Sullivan's book, *Retrograde Planets*:

\-Impatience arises easily at this stage, but hastening the process simply will not work

\-Be experimental, yet cautious

\-Actively lay the groundwork for the future by being passively receptive to the current conditions; don‚Äôt sign contracts or initiate new enterprises or make major purchases

\-Exciting energy of new beginnings is combined with a sense of restraint and this creates tension

\-Develop new potentials, options and opportunities

\-By not making major decisions and resisting the impulse to wade in, one contains one‚Äôs anxiety and builds a more appropriate method of operation (the frequent repercussions from a Promethean impetuousness have given Mercury retrograde a bad name)

\-The mind is gradually acquiring the information and perspective that the will should exercise when the direct cycle begins after the station-direct

\-It is time for surveying the scene and scanning the horizon for new tools that might be useful in the near future

\-The unconscious is busy acquiring input that will surface in a more concrete way during the direct phase

\-This is profoundly educational time and is intensely creative in an embryonic way

\-It remains a time of holding back full power of executive action, yet is still highly stimulating in a developmental fashion

\-Frustration can be high due to the inability to formulate fully matured ideas or situations; trust and letting go become profound lessons

\-When circumstances demand that something must be completed during this phase, it is wise to be prepared for change and flexibility becomes an asset, so insert a ‚Äòprovisional change codicil‚Äô to obviate serious planning flaws

Don't max yourself out, but remain focused on the tasks at hand. Pisces calls for us to go with the flow; allow the Universe to work through you for you. Give yourself time to relax and refresh to remain balanced in the journey ahead. Take time to meditate. Focus on your biggest dreams, set your intentions, and initiate the action so that the Universe may bring you upon your Divine calling. New Moons may make you feel tired, especially in Pisces, so allow yourself time to rest as a new cycle is beginning. The work begins now.. Manifest. The stars are the limit, and they are limitless.

**2016** - Trump's ""grab em by the pussy"" tape surfaces. This seemed to have no effect however, but it definitely showed his character much more clearly.

**2017** - the rise of the Me Too movement and Weinstein's fall.

Then, yesterday there was Greta Thunberg's address to the UN, and *then* impeachment hearings, as well as Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament being declared unlawful.

So now I'm wondering, could there be a connection between things like these in past years and it being the time of the scales of justice? I saw another post seeming to relate the impeachment with Saturn's position, but I wonder if this could also be a factor?

Or am I just making patterns out of things as I always do?

May 7th - Today we will be the Full Moon in Scorpio. Astrology is an important piece of how I perceive what is going on in our world, in myself and others.  So today, I will share with you what I have learned and experienced over the years about these energies and what we could possibly be experiencing over the next several days. 
This is a very important week in astrology because of this full moon.  It brings about energies of death and rebirth; major transformation can take place through deep purging.  In this scorpio full moon, we can welcome the death of an old life, an old Identity, an old way of being and doing in this world.  It's an opportunity for us to take a leap of faith into the unknown. 
Now is the time to reinvent yourself and the life you desire.  Whatever is weighing you down or holding you back often is rooted in the past.  So, now is an opportunity to let go of the weight of the past and everything else you don't want in your life anymore.  This can be people, relationships, jobs, creers, friends, material items, habits, routines, and even your state of mind. 
What have you been struggling with for way too long?  What have you not been able to let go of?

Your life is a personal experience no matter how close your natal chart is to someone else is.
On a more astrological side, the ""bad"" transits will always be there, ongoing. Don't wait for them to end, learn from them. Most importantly listen to yourself, body and spirit.

605,bbq88x,False,None,116,Moon in Gemini Overview,astrology,"Believe it or not, Gemini Moon is very different from its Sun counterpart. Moon represents emotions, instinct and our inner lives. While Sun is our character or how we present ourselves to others, Moon is who we are deep down, our personality.

Moon in Gemini people are usually intelligent (though astrology cannot guarantee either high nor low Iq), but unfortunately for them and those who surround them, their minds are scattered to so many places at once that they can confuse others easily (and probably themselves, too). They want to know everything... at once. Though they tend to naturally multitask, they are usually not good at it, except if their chart indicates otherwise. What they usually do is jump from one thing to another, finishing it only when the circumstances force them to.

Gemini is an air sign meaning they approach emotions from the intellectual side, not the emotional one. They are also a mutable sign which means they are not constant in what they do and prefer to go with the flow (that's the reason Gemini‚Äôs mind is so scattered). This Moon feels safe when they can verbalize their emotions and you can find many Gemini Moons having no problem talking about intimate stuff (emotional-wise) even with complete strangers.  Because they don't know what to do with emotions and feeling intense emotions scares them, the only way to neutralize emotions for them is to talk. Talking feels like catharsis.

When Gemini inhabits the Moon it gives the native a personality that doesn't want to deal with emotions. They will talk about them extensively but it's only their way of relieving tension from not knowing what to do with them. After all, talking about emotions rationalizes them so it's easier for these natives to talk through emotions rather than feel them. For them talking is feeling and they can't understand the difference.

Because they are so interested in everything that surrounds them, they are least prone to be judgemental about anything and everything you throw at them. In fact, they like things that are ""odd"" and quirky. It makes their mind spin.

People with Moon in Gemini tend to truly have multiple emotional personalities, unlike their Sun counterparts. It's often said that Gemini, being the sign of the Twin, has at least two personalities. It's nothing like dissociative personality disorder because they are definitely one and the same person, but Gemini Moon really has different emotional sides that they change quite often even to the point of forgetting what they felt and how they behaved previously.

Basically what this means is: one day they may feel super happy to see you and act like your best friend. They are not lying. They do truly feel that way. You'll feel great and happy to have such a great friend. The next day, they may feel cold and distant for no apparent reason which will leave you scratching your head wondering what the heck happened. Then the day after that, they are your best friend again which will leave you even more confused.

They don't do it for selfish and egocentric reasons. Gemini Moons are not selfish, they are erratic and unpredictable. Usually, the way they feel has nothing to do with you nor with their feelings for you. It just depends on the moment and their current emotional state. It's funny how Gemini Moons will not even understand why you are angry with them. It's like they have selective dementia where they can't remember how they felt the previous day.

Because it‚Äôs difficult for the Gemini Moons to process feelings on an emotional level, a Gemini will do what they do best - they‚Äôll talk about them. After all, Geminis are good talkers. When their minds get overwhelmed with thought and ideas, and they often do, they will talk about what‚Äôs bothering them to anyone. They don‚Äôt discriminate, they may talk about their deepest secrets even to the people they‚Äôve just met‚Ä¶ so no much for secrecy there. It‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt want to keep a secret (their own and that of other people), but they don‚Äôt see anything wrong with talking about things‚Ä¶ all the time.

The good thing about this Moon is that they are usually very light as they don‚Äôt tend to brood over problems as Scorpio Moons do. If they have a problem, they‚Äôll talk about it, get it off their chest and that will be it. They don‚Äôt hold grudges and if they do get angry one day, they‚Äôll probably forget all about it the next day. It‚Äôs all about the perpetual cycle of their ever-changing personalities.

607,ejmv7p,False,None,102,Who/what is the Saturn in your life? Why it may not be as obvious and cliche as you think,astrology,"Approaching this upcoming notorious Saturn/Pluto conjunction, I have been seeing a lot of posts on different platforms talking about power and how to not give your power away to anyone else.  In other words, the real power comes from inside yourself, and anything coming from something outside yourself is limiting your own power.

At first glance, I always considered myself as someone who was ""above"" anything that would normally be perceived as authority.  For example, I have always seen my parents and older family members as equals to me.  And at work, I have always proudly considered myself to not be a victim of the manager's influence. Even when it came to taking drugs, I always knew confidently that I can live with or without them, and the choice was always up to me.

So when I would see these messages about not giving away your power, I would naturally think this doesn't really apply to me.  I could check that box off my ""to do"" list.

However, this past year, having done more internal work on my fears than ever before, I realized there had been an elephant in the room my entire life that I had been giving my power to.

The best way I can describe it is that I always felt I had been banished to live within certain limits.  Growing up in a lower middle class environment, I just always assumed that I was never going to be ""one of those"" people.  Some people lived a great life who got to have all of the nice things, with a family, a nice house, a nice car, and a job that they loved. But I was not one of those.

I created this ""phantom God"" in my mind, who limited my existence to where I could only live in apartments and work minimum wage jobs.  Maybe if I were really lucky, I would be able to even have a spouse that loved me.  But overall, I was to live in this small circle of limitations, and other people were living beyond the circle.

So when you think of who is really controlling you, it might not be as obvious as you think.  It might not be an authority figure that you can point to and say ""There! That's it!"".  It might be something much more ethereal and vague than you could have imagined consciously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/ejmv7p/whowhat_is_the_saturn_in_your_life_why_it_may_not/,161,What does everyone think of Saturn in the 8th? ,2020-01-03 22:24:53

621,9q8s28,False,None,26,Notes on the Full Moon in Taurus and what it could mean for you,astrology,"(hi)

Happening at 1 degree of Taurus on October 24th, this month‚Äôs full moon is the dramatic crescendo, the climax, the plot twist that may define how these recent narratives of love and relationship will end. What drama are you currently embroiled in? What cast of characters are off-script? Or is it a soliloquy, a one man show diving deep into the players of your own psyche? October 24th marks a halfway point to these stories, but not an intermission. Stay seated, stay grounded. This is the Taurus way.

This lunation is ruled, again, by a retrograde Venus (now at 4 degrees of Scorpio), injecting themes of love, romance, relationship and value into our emotional awareness. In Taurus, these themes will be apparent and solid, brought down from the ethereal into real, from ideas into practice, and from hopes into reality. That is the groudedness of Taurus, a place where the moon delights. Where the Venus-ruled New Moon in Libra had us grappling with thoughts or concepts, the idea of balance and reciprocity, and initiations of what we want to come, Taurus will now have us grappling with what ***is.***

We know by now that the retrograde movement by Venus in Scorpio is unearthing all of our junk. And if we‚Äôve been good celestial students, we have been confronting the shadows and blind spots that do not serve our highest good when it comes to Love with a capital L. It is no coincidence, then, that this Full Moon is known as a Hunter‚Äôs Moon. It is the time, metaphorically, where we seek for those things that will fatten and insulate us through the winter‚Äîso apropos for Taurus. RX Venus in a Mars-ruled sign is that hunter, seeking for those things that will fill us up, nourish us, and get us through‚Äîif not first by identifying those things that won‚Äôt. What is learned here can insulate these areas of your life, cushioning and comforting you with new understanding.

Into the specifics...

Retrograde Uranus accompanies this moon at 0 degrees of Taurus. Uranus is the element of surprise, and full moons always illuminate what was kept under cover of darkness. This could be the about-face, the sharp left out of left field that turns up the stakes in this story. Easily, this subverts the stability of Taurus: two left feet, everything left topsy-turvy. But what is realized, whatever honesty or bluntness or change or shock that is endured here can become the foil to our hero‚Äôs journey, the motivating factor that then fortifies our way forward into a just and peaceful result (Venus). And this could be an internal struggle, a sudden insight or understanding brought forth from you to you, the most important relationship of all. A Sun to Uranus opposition here (1 degree orb) invigorates our will and ego, encouraging us to try something different, assert ourselves in new ways. Uranus helps us to ***be*** the change we wish to see in our lives, or else invites us to accept the ones that come. As with any opposition: moderation. May your revolution be soft. Let the Moon in Taurus ground you through any upset, and help you take plot twists in stride. The story isn‚Äôt over. Root and regroup.

All this reckoning could use a backbone. Saturn enters scene at 4 degrees of Capricorn, forming both a sextile to Venus and trine to the Moon. As James Brown would say, ‚ÄúPapa don‚Äôt take no mess!‚Äù Meaning both, Saturn energy won‚Äôt allow you to be knocked around and that Saturn energy won‚Äôt allow you to fool around. Saturn contacts to softies Venus and Moon can be serious and sober, but the light touch of a sextile and trine ensures these are supportive ones. Saturn in Capricorn loves building things, strong things. This sets the stage for more mature perspectives on love and value, ones that take into account the long view. It is what we build here, right now, that can carry us forth into strong new beginnings and behaviors. Saturn asks us to manage our boundaries, where we have too little or too many. Where we are too allowing, or too restricted. Can we manage our expectations where they may be too high or too low? Saturn reinforces, so make sure you pour your concrete exactly how you want it before it dries.

Lastly, Mercury in Scorpio at 21 degrees will be throwing a square to Mars in Aquarius at 17 degrees, and a sextile to Pluto in Capricorn at 18 degrees. What you and others are saying and thinking around this full moon is charged, as a Scorpionic Mercury amplifies the voices of the inner troublemakers and ground-shakers. Again, the potential to be thrown off during this lunation is high. But Mercury can help you call upon those inner reserves of strength and communicate or ruminate on them.  Here, there is a fine line between being in power and being ***em***powered. The urge to use speech and thought to control and protect what comes up will be there‚Äîbut at what vibration? As discussed before, Mars is the courageousness that helps us break new ground, or the anger and impulsiveness that can break down. Pluto‚Äôs refined touch here can grant you a serious study, the wisdom to think before you speak, the command to convey and persuade, and the depth to contain what is said. This is a mind and these are words that can pierce past the facade, and acquaint us with truth and the authenticity of ourselves and others.

And Taurus rules the vocal chords‚Äîthe literal conveyor of words. This is a beautiful synchronicity and a reminder to go softly no matter how rough the going can get around this moon. There is a substantial presence and power to the Taurus bull upon first look, maybe even a meanness. But past that, there is always a peace and placidity in their eyes.

623,fyil51,False,None,70,The Planet Jupiter,astrology,"I felt compelled to write about my thoughts on the planet Jupiter for anyone who might be interested- the good and the bad. 

Imagine you're staring up at the stars or standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon overlooking the *vast* expanse in front of you. It's *awe-inspiring*. It fills you with *wonder*. It makes you realise that there are much greater forces at work beyond your tiny little self. The realities of bill paying and mundane chores are a world away. You look out at the horizon and start to think big and dream and hope. You suddenly have a sense of perspective, understanding, faith, belief in something greater, something higher, something *more*\- this is Jupiter. It is epic in scale, legendary, mythic, beyond words. It fills you up and carries you on a high, makes you soar on optimism and a fascination for what's out there, waiting to be uncovered and explored. It makes you seek out and discover, it gives you meaning and purpose in life, it's your compass. This is why it's the Greater Benefic. It rules priests and sages and gurus and philosophers and scholars. Those who dispense advice and spiritual wisdom.¬†Those who journey to find the truth and then teach and preach it to those willing to learn. And Jupiter does have the potential to shower you with knowledge, wonder, and blessings. Astronomically it's the Great Protector, its gravity pulling in comets that would otherwise smash into the Earth and slinging them away into deep space. 

HOWEVER Jupiter can also become self-righteous, self aggrandising and self-mythologising. Like the Sun it can have an inflated sense of self importance, which with Jupiter can veer into ""I'm divinely chosen, my beliefs are the *right* beliefs, and I'm meant to do something great, it's my calling."" Jupiter can become a zealot. Jupiter can also be too abstract and theoretical and ungrounded, not at all rooted in reality. The professor who lectures from their ivory tower, who promises a lot with big dreams and grand visions but doesn't always deliver. Jupiter can leave you disappointed and disillusioned, the expectations you had about your life lying in pieces all around you. You'll see all these themes (the good and the bad) in the two signs it rules- Sagittarius and Pisces. You'll also see in them Jupiter's indulgence- its indulgence in experiences, alcohol, drugs, food, TV- whatever your vice is, Jupiter (when unhealthy) will want more of it. The expansiveness of Jupiter becomes untameable and unmanageable and can spiral into addiction.  

I wrote a bit of an essay there but I love writing about Jupiter. I feel I can speak to its nature with some authority because I have it conjunct my Ascendant and aspecting other vital planets in my chart. But I feel it's important for all of us to access our Jupiter and find that greater sense of purpose and vision in our lives.

637,erg3e4,False,None,36,Understanding your chart using the Ship Analogy,astrology,"I read an analogy a while ago that helped me. 

Imagine your chart is like a ship. Your asc would be the bow of the ship, and represent the direction you are heading. This is your life path. Everything you meet in life, and everything you send out to the ‚Äúocean‚Äù passes over the bow. Lots of people call our asc our ‚Äúmask‚Äù but that‚Äôs not totally accurate, it‚Äôs more like a filter or lens. Yes, how the world sees you is colored by your asc, but your asc also tells how you see the world. Representing our direction in life, the asc is the most important part of the birth chart (speaking generally, there can be exceptions to any rule.)

Anyway, back to the ship, your Midheaven is your ship‚Äôs mast, it is the first part of your ship people may see coming up over the horizon, this is where your flag waves to announce to the world ‚Äúthis is who I am‚Äù and where the wind meets your sails to carry you forward.

Your descendant is like the deck of your ship, where people come aboard. 

Your IC is the bottom of your boat, hidden under the water. All boats are built from the bottom up, it is your past. It is the foundation that carries you along.

Your chart ruler is the captain of your ship! What state is he in? Is he restricted by Saturn or amped out by an unruly mars? Is he in a good position to see the direction the ship is headed? Is he shining in exaltation or hindered by detriment? His house placement tells us from what area of your life does he command the ship. Aspects to other planets tell us what crew members help or hinder his rulership. The zodiac sign tells us how he expresses himself.

Also every other planet near a key point of your ‚Äúship‚Äù carries extra significance. A fallen moon near your IC makes the bottom of your boat leaky, an exalted Venus at the Midheaven fills your sails with beauty.

641,givarb,False,Discussion/Debate ,19,The Oversimplification of the Sextile,astrology,"(((The following is a write-up of a PERSONAL view of the Sextile aspect through PERSONAL research and experimentation. Feel free to agree or disagree. )))

Aspects have been an incredibly important staple in astrology since the study of the stars first began. The twelve signs of the zodiac are always ‚Äúaspecting‚Äù each other - - viewing or existing conversationally in one way or another. Planets become energized by these aspects of signs, which can be more or less benefic (trine and sextile), malefic (opposition and square), or a  powerhouse of a wild card depending on the combination of planets involved (conjunction). 

Through the years of studying astrology, I‚Äôve seen a great number of astrologers downplay the beauty of the sextile. The conjunction, the opposition, the trine, and the square are all payed adequate homage to, yet the sextile is either lumped in as a simpler satellite to the trine, downplayed as fundamentally weak, in league with minor aspects, or an aspect that shouldn‚Äôt be examined at all unless its orb of influence is particularly tight. 

I feel this is a great mistake. For one, the sextile IS a major aspect. According to the Thema Mundi, it carries the nature of beautiful planet Venus, because Venus-ruled Libra forms a sextile with Sun-ruled Leo, and we never, ever downplay Venus, smitten with every good thing she affords us. Sextile signs are of different modalities but the same polarity - - like people from neighboring nations with different cultures coming together to achieve a common goal. So incidentally, the gifts granted by the sextile are not automatically available to you like they are with the trine, and instead have to be discovered, explored, and cultivated.

In some ways, I feel this can be more powerful than the trine, the aspect lorded over by the greater benefic, Jupiter. Why? Because when blessings and talents are so readily given without being tempered by active cultivation, it can dampen the motivation to *work* towards something with those gifts. Hence the trine being associated with laziness. 

Imagine if you will, a person born into considerable wealth, having never needed to work for said wealth yet benefiting from it as their birthright. That would be akin to the trine, the greater gift. Now picture a person born into a middle or lower-class family, but possessing gifts that have the potential to accrue substantial wealth for the native IF they discover what those gifts are, and work towards cultivating them and bringing them to light. That is the sextile, the lesser gift. We tend to prefer the former, but the latter has its place. 

The sextile, like the trine, is a beneficial aspect, but comes with its own energy and blessings, not to be confused or combined with that of the trine. I believe sextiles are more important than what they are currently given credit for. And I feel that people should not gloss over their sextiles, but study them and work out the buried gifts and talents that they are promising.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/givarb/the_oversimplification_of_the_sextile/,155,"I once read, and I think it was here, that in order for the sextile to work for you, you need to overcome the squares in your chart.

&#x200B;

**Our first shift:** [**Mercury retrograde in Pisces**](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/03/05/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-horoscope-march-5th-march-28th/)

*Summary:*  

Self care is always important, but during **Mercury Retrograde in Pisces**, it will be forced to the forefront of your brain. If you aren‚Äôt taking care of your mental health, expect those retrograde dilemmas like accidentally dropping your phone in the toilet or yelling on your phone about your 3rd canceled flight in a row, to really accelerate and force you to sit still for a moment with your self and decide what‚Äôs worth getting angry about and what‚Äôs just a temporary set back.

Remember, that‚Äôs all **Mercury retrograde** is ‚Äì a temporary set back, delay, or a review of your past. Relationships that develop now will teach you a lesson, break ups that happen now will resolve long standing issues, and each of these will most likely be temporary and will disappear or return around **April 17th** when we **leave the shadow period.**

**Our second shift:** [**Uranus enters Taurus**](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/03/05/uranus-enters-taurus-progression-comes-after-earthquakes/)

*Summary:* 

**Uranus** is not happy in **Taurus**, this sign being its fall position. **Taurus** is very slow, steady, and traditional. **Uranus**, though it is a slow outer planet, desires quick changes, progression and innovation. This means we‚Äôre about to see some rather strange happenings with those normal, material structures we‚Äôve had for so long.

Take grocery shopping, for example. You might go to the store and purchase a loaf of bread, or you may get it sent to you via the new Amazon Fresh feature. Expect to see more of these in the future. Uber Eats, Postmates, and Thrive Market are just the beginning. Automation will also be booming over the next 7-8 years, aiding in the growth of a gig economy as people are replaced and move over to more musical, artsy and crafty jobs.

**Our third shift:** [**New Moon in Pisces**](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/03/05/new-moon-in-pisces-a-new-creative-freedom-to-cleanse-and-dream/)

*Summary:* 

Dream, and dream big! The seeds we‚Äôre planting now are full of lofty goals and fantasies, especially with this magical **Neptune** conjunction. Dispel the illusions that your ego tries to spit at you, and allow yourself to float freely in the gentle waves. All is well. Take it slow. Allow your mind to wander to a beautiful future filled with abundance and love.

If there was ever a time to craft an extremely expansive, completely fantastical and opulent goal, now is the time, the best time, to plant that seed and give full faith into yourself and your guides that it will manifest. I highly recommend going full force into self help books, manifestation and Law of Attraction teachings, tarot, oracle, and any spiritual tool or interest you have at this time. You‚Äôll be surprised at the wonderful things you will create.

649,ceuzas,False,Transits,32,Transit Guide for Beginners (5 Steps),astrology,"
1. There‚Äôs two kinds of Transits you can look at:

a) by ASPECT: the planets in their current position in the sky (= ‚Äútransit planets‚Äù) making aspects to the planets‚Äô position from the time when you were born  (= ‚Äúnatal planets‚Äù). They can aspect one or more planets in your natal Chart.
The nature of the Transit will be shown by the basic energies of all planets involved, as well as the nature of the aspect. Generally harmonious aspects feel smooth, empowering and rather pleasant while disharmonious aspects may feel frustrating, threatening and generally unsettling. Remember though: transits show the kind energy that is currently in your life - they never show the outcome and the way you deal with it is up to you always. 
By showing you what is going on in your life, astrology can guide you to work with these energies instead of against them.

‚ÄúHarmonious‚Äù = trine, sextile, (sometimes conjunction, depending on the planets involved)

‚ÄúDisharmonious‚Äù= opposition, square, inconjunction, (sometimes conjunction)

PS. You can also look at minor aspects  (above I only listed the major aspects). As a beginner, I‚Äôd suggest starting with the major aspects, though)

b) by HOUSE: as the planets are constantly moving they will basically transit counter-clockwise through your natal Chart over the years. Due to their difference in speed, this will take them a different amount of time. Thus, the Moon (fastest moving planet) moves through your whole Chart every 28 days while Pluto (slowest) takes around 250 years (in 2. I will explain why this is important).
The current House the planets are transiting through will show you the area of life where that planet‚Äôs energy will be showing up, asking to be integrated. Usually the transit feels stronger at the beginning of the House and the effects lessen once the planet has traveled towards the end of the House, about to enter the new one. During its stay in each House you have the opportunity to individually learn about and integrate the themes of the planet + the House (i.e. Pluto in 1st House = Transformation (Pluto) of the Self (1H) or Jupiter (expansion) in the area of 4H (family, roots). 

1H = (AC) the self, identity, physical constitution, birth, conditioning, beginnings 

2H = money, income, values, self worth, your belongings, resources, real estate, living conditions, shelter, food, the body

3H = communication, learning, siblings, peers, neighbourhoods

4H = (IC) childhood, family, home, the mother. private life, the private persona, roots, ancestors, emotions, the soul 
 
5H = fun/play, children, romance/ affairs, young adulthood, hobbies, self-expression, (the father) 

6H = work, routine, health, servitude, animals, daily life, the mundane 

7H = relationships, love, commitment, close friendships, connection to other people

8H = the hidden, sexuality, intimacy, death (and rebirth), occult/taboo stuff, ‚Äúdark‚Äù themes, supernaturalism, psychological resources, other people‚Äôs money (inheritances etc) 

9H = world views, travel, spirituality, higher learning (like university)

10H = (MC) career, society, the public persona, (the father)

11H = groups, friends, the collective, societal causes, humanitarianism, the internet 

12H = the subconscious, dreams, solitude, spirituality, out of world experiences, psychedelic substances (drugs), endings 


2. When looking at transiting planets, always look at the outer planets (Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, (Chiron), Saturn) first. Their Transits are of greater significance in comparison to the Transits of quicker moving planets such as the Moon, Venus, Mercury or the Sun. They set the underlying tone of your life‚Äôs phase, they take longer than Moon/Venus/Mercury (...) Transits and they often are once-in-a-lifetime, marking character developments, challenges and turning points in your life.
As a general rule, I look at Transits of: Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Chiron, Saturn and Jupiter and at a few instances at Mars and Venus (but only if I‚Äôve been feeling Mars-y or Venus-y and want to find out why :)

Pluto = (inner) change, transformation, authenticity, purging, buried/hidden/dark parts of the psyche, trauma, resilience, strength, core 

Neptune = dissolution, release, universal love, dreams, creativity, spirituality, confusion, loss, dependency, lack of boundaries, addiction

Uranus = (outer) change, independence, freedom, breaking free, disruption, upheaval, shock 

Chiron = pain, (old) wounds, sensitivity, healing

Saturn = maturity, accountability, structure, law and order, cause and effect, restriction, Karma, blocks/ obstacles, growth, patience, fruit of labour 

Jupiter = expansion, opportunity, luck, happiness, fortune, overdoing things

3. As for the natal planets that are being aspected, the personal planets (Sun, Moon, Venus, Mercury, Mars) matter a tad more than the generational planets (Pluto etc). Your personal planets are ‚Äúvery personal‚Äù as someone only born a few days before or after you might have them at completely different positions (esp. the Moon, which represents our feelings). They make up the ‚Äúbasic 5‚Äù of our personality. Transits to our personal planets are felt more directly as they mark changes to our very core (which doesn‚Äôt mean that Transits to the other planets don‚Äôt matter though but to keep it simple I will not go into detail about them here)

Sun = self, identity, action, wants, males (esp.the father)

Moon = feelings, needs, sensitivity, females (esp. the mother)

Venus = relating, showing love and affection, sensuality, beauty, money, the (inner) female

Mercury = thinking, communicating, expressing one‚Äôs self, moving, siblings and family members, neighbors and people from your immediate surroundings (class mates, room mates etc) 

Mars = energy, acting, assertion, aggression, fighting, sexuality, the (inner) male, lovers 

4. Keep in mind: The Transit isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmaking‚Äù you feel or experience something. The analogy I use would be more of how you Chart and it‚Äôs Transits are like a clock - they work after the principle of synchronicity (‚Äúas above, so below‚Äù) which means what happens with you can be seen in your personal Transits but it‚Äôs more of a mirror of what‚Äôs happening with(in) you - and not the other way around. So basically saying things like, Mars‚Äô energy is making me angry, isn‚Äôt quite accurate. The anger that is manifesting in your life right now is shown/ signified by Mars in your Transit Chart

5. I swear to God : Google is your friend :)
With this guide you have a small tool-kit to roughly have an idea how to find out what‚Äôs going on in your Chart transit-wise. However, once you‚Äôve seen (for example) that Pluto is transiting your AC or Neptune is squaring your Sun, I‚Äôd just advice you to simply google the Transit - there‚Äôs many great sites out there, explaining them brilliantly. 
I still do this all the time and it‚Äôs always an eye-opener :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/ceuzas/transit_guide_for_beginners_5_steps/,153,"Thanks for posting a topic for astrological discussion! Please remember:

Also I‚Äôm sorry but I wasn‚Äôt able to make bar graphs for all placements like I promised, I didn‚Äôt really know how to. I went on Excel and made 3 bar graphs but they looked really ugly and confusing so I decided to only make bar graphs for the most common sun, moon and rising sign. If you want to see that as well as the pie graphs that google forums automatically generated you can find that here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/PH8YjIG](https://imgur.com/gallery/PH8YjIG)

680,9z3vey,False,None,20,Notes on the Full Moon in Gemini and What it Could Mean for You,astrology,"**11/23/2018**

Out from a tumultuous period of retrogrades, from the cosmic weight of planets rolling in the deep of Scorpio, the Full Moon in Gemini now invites us to *think* our way forward instead of *feeling* our way around in the dark. The skies are bombastic now, full of opportunities and choices, of adventures and possible foibles. Our hero‚Äôs journey sees us out of the dark woods, standing looking upon a vast expanse of land. From Little Red Riding Hood, desperately uncovering the disguised wolves of our lives, trying to make it out alive, to Peter Pan‚Äînimble, cheerful, unending youth and curiosity. It is here where we can be born again into wonder and levity, and their older siblings, rumination and objectivity. This Full Moon will form the backbone of a T-Square, among the most tense configurations in Astrology. And so Gemini comes bearing the gift of flexibility, massaging what is taut, entertaining new and clever ways to hack the system. As Peter Pan said, we can learn to fly using *lovely wonderful thoughts,* so here we can mitigate any trouble by forging forward with a new set of ideas, and thinking our way into new possibilities. 

But be discerning. A retrograde Mercury rules this lunation from 10 degrees of Sagittarius, the sign of its detriment. Add to this, the Moon opposing broad minded Jupiter at 3 degrees of Sagittarius. There is massive potential here for giant thoughts, giant words, enthusiastic conversations and realizations. But, too, is there potential for overlooking details, miscommunication, and generally thinking, saying, and doing *the most--*open mouth, insert foot. The beauty of a Gemini moon is not having to stick to first impressions, triggers, feelings, or impulses‚Äîespecially the bad ones. Any breakdown in communication, or breakdown in emotion, can become breakthroughs when we learn to see them differently. There are two sides to every story, and with Gemini, maybe even three, four, five. Choose the one that empowers you forward, or exercise those mental muscles until you can. With dignified Jupiter in the picture, conjuncting the Sun with a 3 degree orb, our challenged thoughts and communication can meet an ultimate alchemy. There is nothing too big for Jupiter to heal or help. The bigness that may lend itself to sloppy encounters, can then become a mythic sized redirection of purpose. All you need is a little *faith, and trust, and pixie dust.*

Teeing up the T-square is Mars, taking up residence at 4 degrees of Pisces after months of back and forth between cerebral Aquarius and calculated Capricorn. Here, martial energies are relaxed, soft, and lacking rigor. Mars in Pisces is compassionate action. Where the past few weeks or months may have laid bare and raw where our lives aren‚Äôt working, here Mars comes to assist in spiritual clean up, casting a kinder eye on ourselves and our stories. The drive of Mars may feel diluted in Pisces, like trying to rev a water-logged engine, but all the same is a healing respite. And even the lyrical underwater movements of Pisces can move us forward in subtle ways. So to be sure, there is no resting or stalling when Mars is around, but at least Pisces takes the edge off, as Pisces, boundless and expansive, has no edges. We can look to the apex planet of any T-Square to find relief from the tension of the opposition (here, between the Sun and Moon, Moon and Jupiter). And so Mars reminds us that empathy is our get out of jail free card, that acting on higher minded ideals of universal love and understanding set us free from our smaller, more personal problems. Mars in Pisces is also the lover, the creative, finding the inherent poetry beneath any situation. So dance, cry, write, draw‚Äîactively romance your way into loving where you are. Like Pan--*If you cannot teach me to fly, teach me to sing!* So if you can‚Äôt soar above it, learn to love it. And should this sound too airy-fairy Tinkerbell to you, know that Saturn will be sextiling Mars from 7 degrees of Capricorn, substantiating and making practical the healing done here, and helping us make decisions that support our long-term growth. 

The Moon, Sun, Mercury, and Mars are all under Jupiter‚Äôs rules this lunation, making Jupiter the relevant final dispositor of this chart, this moment in the sky. All actions and reactions, therefore, can be taken in the spirit of, well, high spirits. Even though manic panic planet, Mercury, may seem to threaten the cosmic order we‚Äôve been waiting for, Jupiter looms larger and with optimism. Even Uranus, still opposing Venus in the night sky, is ruled by this positive motivation. So to me, this full moon is expansive and reassuring. Where you teeter totter into overdoing or overlooking or over-feeling things, a Jupiterian caution, Gemini comes in with mental acuity and detachment, with wonder and flexibility, helping you to mind your *mind.*

681,9fdjz6,False,None,61,"Playing with fire, about fire signs (Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) and their differences.",astrology,"**Sun signs don‚Äôt mean everything, in fact this is also having to do with the sign in its raw power as well as how it can be associated with other planets.**

I am going to do a few of these but wanted to start off with fire signs first due to some unique reasons.

**Apparently they are considered among the most ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù**

Aries is considered to be the most masculine sign out there, not saying this is a good or bad thing, followed closely by Leo. Sags are right behind them which makes fire signs the most masculine, not saying that this is a good or even a bad thing. Cancer which is the most feminine sign which is why it is associated with being more motherly. I found it unique in the sense that these signs express themselves more openly but I will get more into how they are different about it.

**In terms of how we typically think of astrology, which is sun signs, Leo is domiciled in the sun while Aries is exalted**

I am sure by now most of us are all too familiar with the words domicile and exalt but if you aren‚Äôt, you should probably look those up as that will also be mentioned. So while Leo is supposedly the ideal placement for a sun sign like Capricorn is for Saturn and Libra is for Venus, Aries is the sun expressed at its greatest extent which is its exaltation. It never really gets mentioned for some reason in astrology and I actually had to look it up, for a while I never knew that the sun had any domiciles or exalts.

**Now lets get to the differences I‚Äôve noticed between the signs and how it plays to their nature.**

**1 - Aries is a ball of raw energy that is fearless yet it moves on.**

I‚Äôve rarely known an Aries to do things like holding a grudge or holding on to things in general unless their chart had other placements that would indicate such a thing. An Aries is the kind of person where if you piss them off, they‚Äôll punch you in the face or chew you out then and there, after that they will just forget about it. In terms of examples, think of Aries as almost being child-like in a good way, they tend to go head-on and not care too much about what may happen, the true example of fearlessness.

In worst cases, it can mean some drunk guy at a bar who will pick a fight with anyone but in the best cases, it means a freedom fighter or someone that comes up with a brilliant idea in tough times. Unlike a lot of the other signs, expect for Aries to tell you what is on their mind then and there. I find them to be very forgiving compared to the other fire signs.

While the popular idea is that Leos (more on them later) are people persons, in reality I find that Aries tend to have a lot of friends and be popular because they just don‚Äôt care all that much, especially in younger ages where bold behavior is admired. 

**2- Leos might be fearless but they plan a lot more, never forget and can get away with a lot, it speaks to the nature of them being a fixed sign.**

In terms of pure raw energy, Leos cannot match Aries and they also do care a bit more about what others think of them yet they‚Äôll always do things they set their minds to. There are a lot of misconceptions about this sign but the one thing I have often found to be true about them is that they are very good at reading people. While flattery can get on their good side, they can often tell if it is fake or genuine. I‚Äôll say of all the fire signs, Leos are tactical in that they will see things through to the very end, for better or worse, and speaking of that‚Ä¶.

One thing I‚Äôll note about Leo heavy charts is that there is a lot of class and upscale type of vibe associated with them, its tough to explain in words alone but if you know enough Leos you just sense that.

I would say that Leo is the only sign that will not only hold a grudge for the longest of time but unlike other signs who just think about it but rarely act (e.g.:  Scorpios which is pretty much an all bark no bite type of sign), they will always act on it. To make matters even worse for someone, they almost always get away with doing a lot of damage to people as we have famously seen with politicians and celebrities that have this placement. Even if they smile in your face and pretend to forgive, they‚Äôll always carry out their revenge behind closed doors, always. 

Getting on a Leo‚Äôs bad side is the equivalent of a king repeatedly stabbing you with a sword as the crowd cheers, they‚Äôll get the world to turn on you and hit you where it hurts, hard. Compared to other fire signs, they‚Äôre not above fighting dirty but unlike other signs that also fight dirty (e.g. Scorpio), they‚Äôll look clean doing it. 

At worst, I would say a character that embodies a Leo well is Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars, very good at scheming and often the cruel sign out there when angry that is creative in making someone‚Äôs life miserable. At their best, I see them as a sign that is capable of inspiring a lot of people through a lot of the better qualities that are associated with the sign.

Of all the signs, this is the last one you would to offend outside of maybe Capricorn. Word of advice, do not offend their ego.

**3 - Sagittarius are the old souls among fire signs, wise beyond their years and the most resourceful.**

A Sagittarius can get itself out of the worst situations and also has the power to make the most out of a bad situation. I have found that of all the signs out there, they tend to travel a great deal. Initially I thought that Gemini was the sign that traveled but it is actually Sagittarius in a natal chart that indicates a person is the type to travel a lot.

Of all the fire signs, I have Sagittarius to be the most open minded and free to trying new things. I have also found that this is the one sign who can be your enemy one day but if they see it beneficial to be friends with you, they will be friends with you. It is a sign I think should be embodied by diplomacy and fairness.

Now I have found this sign to be wise beyond their years, for some reason I noticed a lot of my college professors had this sign. Imagine a cafe with people talking about intellectual things an average mind cannot grasp, without question it is Sagittarius territory. The sign is almost like a sage in some ways, the voice of reason in a room.

It happens again in 2020.",astrology,"In late fall of the year 1894 BCE, Saturn had just transited Pluto at the end of Capricorn, and Jupiter was aproaching to do the same. Saturn left the sign before Jupiters transit of Pluto, and there were no retrograde periods to bring them back together. At this time, the ancient city of Babylon was established by Sumu Abum, an Amorite King. The city was small and insignificant, but within a few short generations it grew. By the sixth dynasty, less then 100 years later, the King Hammurabi codefied a series of simple rules and regulations inspired by Samash the Sun god, by adopting previously existing edicts into new socio-economic realities. These regulations inspired by divinity were etched in stone, and have influenced all modern law to this day.   


Unlike the triple conjunction that birthed Babylonia, which lasted only a few months, the coming trifecta in Capricorn will last almost an entire year. Jupiter enters Capricorn in December of next year. In mid March 2020, when Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto are all within 10 degrees, Mars and the Moon will join the super stellium. Saturn will cross into Aquarius soon after, but retrogrades will pull all three back together in Capricorn for the summer. In October, all three will again be moving direct, but now within 6 degrees. The triple conjunction persists until mid December when Jupiter and Saturn move into Aquarius.

Aries - They will literally do anything for their partner and love spoiling and loving them. They are patient with their partners

Taurus - They have some serious balls. They are SO focused when they're working toward something, and Taurus communication is clear and very to the point.

Gemini - They are way more emotional than meets the eye. Their emotions move at lightning speeds and it can be hard for even a seasoned Gemini to control

Cancer - They are super stylish and will tell you exactly what's on their mind. They're comfortable enough to tell you what they're thinking

Leo - They are known for ego, but Leos actually want everyone to be happy. Other people being happy gives an incredible glow and boost to a Leo's mood. 

Virgo - Virgos are super independent. Whether in thought or action, Virgo is a very prominent sign

Libra - Libras are always beautiful. They have a certain purple glow that's absolutely magnetic

Scorpio - They are always thinking. They don't ever stop thinking and feeling. Their death and rebirth happens because they live lifetimes worth of thought over and over again

Sagittarius - They are absolutely wild. Their quest for knowledge often runs through experience of everything, so na√Øveity + fearlessness + bravery = the wild stallion that is Sag

Capricorn - They're not all these dry, boring workaholics. They're fun, love to party, and they are absolutely loyal- comparably with Scorpio

Aquarius - Aquarius are insanely intelligent. They would (and can) change the entire world. They will listen to your problems for hours and hours and offer real, logical solutions

Notice i say *feel* because thats what Pisces is all about. Their logic is swayed by *feelings* and their own inner world. I find myself and other pisces mercury‚Äôs struggle with overthinking/anxiety. Its as if they are too susceptible to their ENVIRONMENT, and when in a toxic environment, its easy for them to become intoxicated. 
It feels like im constantly in a daze (a lonely daze) because its easy for pisces to be a martyr and feel sorry for themselves, or that the world revolves around them. I find unevolved pisces energy cant SEE the big picture (like aquarius for example, can) and instead they only see what they WANT to see based off their imagination.
Its like being in a constant vortex? 


Pisces Venus is also considered an exalted placement but I for one think its also very challenging. Love is complicated, and Pisces is willing to explore love, and have unconditional love, but they also are willing to suffer more than whats necessary. Again, UNHEALTHY venus pisces will literally MAKE themselves suffer at times because they need to feel like theyre being that martyr, fighting a good fight, and if theyre not suffering are they really loving????

690,g2h9a9,False,None,63,The key to Saturn transits,astrology,"Is patience. Saturn is very unrelenting. But what ppl don't realize is Saturn is mainly self imposed. Planets that come after Mars or the personal planets are reactive. It's the world around us reacting to our own actions. It's out of our control yet still impacted by our decisions. Pretty much, it'll happen regardless. Saturn, Saturn is conclusive. As is Mars and Pluto and combining them gives a person killer instincts. Not in the brutal way but very much in a finalizing way. And with Saturn, he closes useless chapters. Pluto closes destructive chapters. Mars closes whatever chapter he chooses. But they all end things.

With Saturn you have to be patient. To have to let the storm pass. You have to take care of business, do what has to be done so you can lighten your load. But you still have to deal with the ramifications. I see that now as Saturn is transiting my moon until it moves back to Capricorn. It opposes my leo moon. Let me tell ya, I'm lonely, a lil depressed and just agitated. But with the moon we often reflect. And with Saturn, we are buried alive. My emotions are doing just that. But you have to be patient. The storm always passes as does Saturn. Saturn offers strength and wisdom by cutting you off. You are cut off from what you deem important. And when you are all alone, all you can do is think. But you have to do more than that because destruction with Saturn can be hard to stop. He is habitual by nature and uses repetition for his method. 


But just be patient. It's a test of virtue. Like Hercules who I feel is also represented by Saturn, he is a task completer. He finishes the job and gives his all. Cronos, was not always bad. it was his fear of karma that consumed him. Before that, he ruled with Grace and honesty. That's the flip side to Saturn. But he comes to add depth, wisdom and strength. He comes to uproot things, untangle weeds and allow for growth. He removes restrictions by showing them. At this time, I must grow but when I do.......
It will be powerful. I slipped into some very bad habits But I can overcome them. All it takes is effort. 



So I will March down this path...... alone, hurt, angry. But these are all emotions that I must uproot so I can be emotionally calm, stable and at peace. I wish I knew how this ends but I don't. But I have been on the positive side of a Saturn transit and when I was patient and controlled.....the benefits were just....amazing.

Literally, his actual house. It's probably full of different tools of from different fields -- like various scientific equipment, books on different subjects, writing utensils, scholarly articles. Maybe there's a telephone on the wall, a TV flipping channels, access to the internet -- it's full of potential pathways of interest. Mercury likes to keep busy and stay informed, and experiment with new knowledge, so these are the things he fills he house with.

If Mercury's house (3rd house) is under the sign of the Capricorn constellation, maybe the house is surrounded by high mountains right at sunrise, inspiring accomplishment and aspirations. The structure of the mountains are reminiscent of tradition and order, and their ancient age reminds us of our karmic fates. This is the atmosphere that the 3rd house is residing in here.

And who's here, visiting Mercury's house (3rd house), under the Capricorn stars (in Capricorn)? Why, Mars is passing through. How does forceful and powerful Mars interact with the objects in Mercury's house? How is he influenced by the environment of Capricorn? He sees the tools of interest and education laying around, and the stars fill him with an energy to make something out of it all. And with Mar's red, pulsing energy, he is driven to do a lot with the tools here in the 3rd house! Sure, he might get a little frustrated and tear the place up, but with the right help from his neighbors, he may very well be able to build something great with the tools Mercury left.

I've been struggling with understanding how the planets, constellations, and houses exert their energy in their unique ways on the native. When I started thinking of the planets as actual beings, with desires, personality traits, and a will of their own, it helped me a lot. Maybe it can help you too?

Think about what each planet might be like if they were personified. What would their houses/dwellings be like? What would their home constellation look like as a natural environment?

Now put more than one planet in a specific house. How do they interact with each other in that environment? 

And then to think about the aspects -- Neptune can see Moon across the way waving at him --- they are at a harmonious angle, so the Moon is always sending Neptune smiles and good vibes from her house across the chart. They are at a good angle to each other.

But Pluto, he sees the sun over there, around the block, he hates that guy. He's always sending dirty looks around the corner.

702,bwch29,False,None,120,Moon in Scorpio Overview,astrology,"Believe it or not, even though Scorpio is a water sign and Moon is the natural ruler of Cancer (these signs are in trine), Scorpio is the most difficult position for the Moon to be with.

Water signs are very tuned into emotions and it can come as a surprise that Scorpio is such a difficult position. It is said that Moon is in ‚Äúfall‚Äù when Scorpio inhabits it. Because Scorpio is such an intense sign, it is not compatible with Moon‚Äôs nurturing and gentle attributes. It is difficult to live with Scorpioinc intensity on day to day basis. Natives with this Moon position feel intensely about everything and even if they are happy and content, and nothing special is going on in their lives, they will still feel the seething intensity within them.

It is no wonder that Scorpio Moons are more prone to have addictions than any other Moon sign or even Sun in Scorpio. When I say addiction, it doesn‚Äôt have to be drugs, alcohol or sex. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be recognized as an addiction. It can be something benign and even beneficial that you start using to feel better (like meditation, exercise, needlework, etc) but soon you get addicted to it to the point of obsessively doing it just to numb the intense feelings raging inside you. Over time you realize that you are not doing it just because you like it, but more because it tames the intensity. Even if it‚Äôs not harmful, it‚Äôs still an addiction and in the long run, it can prevent you from doing other things that you love that require you to feel intensely. This is why relaxation methods (whichever they are) don‚Äôt work with Scorpio Moons and can instead have a counter effect.

Scorpio Moon natives often live in the survival mode. They see this world as a constant struggle and are acutely aware of the dangers that lurk at every corner. This is why they can get easily suspicious of people around them through this is usually subconscious. While Scorpio Sun will be aware that they are suspicious of people, Scorpio Moon people may only feel a strange sensation when meeting people that they can‚Äôt even properly articulate. Moon is our subconsciousness, it‚Äôs buried deep within us, it is our very soul. That is why it has the strongest influence on us.

These natives are very perceptive and intuitive. They understand the dark side of the human soul, though it depends on other planetary positions if they will try to ignore it or not.

Usually, these natives are quiet and observing, though if their descendant is in a more extroverted Sun or Ascendant sign (air or fire) they may portray a more outgoing and even loud personality. It‚Äôs only a facade and they can use their Sun/Ascendant to purposefully appear different from how they feel on the inside. They are not doing it because they want to deceive you. They are doing it to protect themselves. The best way to protect your true self is to act in a way that it appears that you aren‚Äôt hiding anything. Scorpio Moon natives know it best.

Scorpio Moons are naturally mistrustful of people. Because Moon represents early childhood, it‚Äôs possible that in that period these natives experienced some kind of abandonment or betrayal. Maybe they had a difficult birth, their mother‚Äôs affections were erratic and not constant, or maybe their mother just had to work hard and spent long hours at work. Whichever may be the case, the child felt from the early age that mother‚Äôs affection could be gone at any moment and that they can be easily abandoned. This created that deep mistrust which resulted from the fear of being abandoned by the people the native loves the most.

It‚Äôs a subconscious fear and the native may often not even know they have this fear. After all, Scorpio Moons usually see themselves as strong and self-reliant people who don‚Äôt need others for help. In order to survive in this cruel world, they must rely only on themselves. If they open up and let go of that fear, they will not be able to protect themselves anymore.

In love, Moon in Scorpio natives are either very cautious or very reckless. Mostly they are cautious because they have that deep need to protect themselves. Even if they are reckless and go from partner to partner without much thinking it‚Äôs only because that way they don‚Äôt have to attach too deep with them and can experience passion and intensity on their own terms. If they do get to trust you, they will form a strong bond with you and they will stick with you through thick and thin. Unless you betray them, which is never a good thing.

Even if Scorpio Moon native‚Äôs other planetary placements are in more detached and easy-going signs, this Moon will still give them black and white attitude towards life. It might not be obvious, not even to them, but they will have either strong loves or strong hates towards people (and things/places/etc). Scorpio Moon natives have a high tolerance for emotional pain and suffering as they are extremely resilient. Unfortunately, this often leads them to be misused by other people. This doesn‚Äôt happen because Scorpio Moon people are weak, quite the opposite. It‚Äôs because they can withstand things but also because they can understand the suffering of others that they will be the least judgemental of all Moon signs which people can sometimes abuse. It‚Äôs often people who are closest to Scorpio Moons that abuse them emotionally the most. If a Scorpio Moon gets attached to somebody they can do anything for them even to their own detriment. As long as people respect and acknowledge this sacrifice, a Scorpio Moon will continue doing it (which is not good for them in the long run, though).

When Scorpio Moon feels that you‚Äôve taken them for a fool, they are capable of switching from love to hate in an instant. Because Scorpio is a fixed sign, once their heart is set on something, it takes a lot of time and effort to change it.

709,fxh7g4,False,None,26,"This is how to like to think of and explain the big 3 (Sun, Moon, Ascendant) .",astrology,"
I want to emphasize this isn‚Äôt all my original thought. With astrology, it‚Äôs pretty impossible to not integrate the works and studies of others into  your interpretations and explanations and general understanding.
The inspiration for explaining the big 3 in this way comes from ‚ÄúThe Only Astrology Book You‚Äôll Ever Need‚Äù. In this book, Joanna Woolfolk explains the sun sign like a the broad strokes of painting (which I mention below). I really loved this analogy, and then found ways to apply that thought structure to the moon and ascendant- but also just with astrology in general. It has allowed me to be able to hold a deep yet simple enough understanding to explain astrology to others. My friends and partners always ask me about astrology, and after getting insecure and frustrated with not being able to explain certain concepts.. I (used parts of other people‚Äôs work) to come up with this. 


EXPLANATION:

The ascendant will highlight certain aspects of your personality.. some you aren‚Äôt even aware of. 
A book I read (The Only Astrology Book You‚Äôll Ever Need) put it this way-
If you consider yourself a painting,  the characteristics of your sun sign are the broad strokes that the artist first lays down in the canvas. The artist outlines your general shape, the planes and angles of your face, the way in which you hold your body.  In the same way - your sun sign delineates your general character. 
The moon in your horoscope modifies your sun sign; it brings new forces, different motivations, and special elements to the character of your sun sign ( I like to add this to the painting example, I think the moon would be the shadows and highlights of the picture, still black and white, filling in some of the empty spaces, giving you a deeper understanding of the character that is being drawn). These can often be the more hidden aspects of the personality. Your knee jerk reactions, instincts, the pieces of yourself you repress from others- even yourself. 
Your ascendant (rising) is the sign that reflects your outward demeanor, and to s great extent determines how the outside world looks at you. Very often, your ascendant is what the world first sees in you, the impression that you first make to other people. Many astrologers believe that your rising sign is more immediately revealing than your sun sign. 
I like to think that the personality you outwardly project is almost always a perfect blend of your sun sign and rising sign. It is this combination that makes your unique impact on the world. 

(I also like to add this to the painting example.. if you think about it, when you are looking at a finished painting of a character, your interpreting the final product. You‚Äôre  looking at the colors, the emotion in the eyes, the shape of the lips, the overall vibe the artist intended to give off (rising).You aren‚Äôt really seeing the broad strokes and the outline the artist first laid down to create this image (sun) but you instinctually know that these concepts are there, and these big shapes make up the image. You certainly aren‚Äôt seeing the shadows and angles and highlights that were there (moon) to tie everything in. You are really just seeing the ‚Äúmask‚Äù, the final product.. what the artist wanted you to see (rising). As you get to know the painting more, as you sit with it, It hangs in your living room you will notice more and more about it and different aspects will be uncovered (like the whole birth chart).",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fxh7g4/this_is_how_to_like_to_think_of_and_explain_the/,137,what is the best moon sign? ,2020-04-08 23:20:04

&nbsp;

The Ascendant is among the specific three sign placements that I usually notice others mention *a lot*: the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù signs (Sun sign / Moon sign / Ascendant sign). The importance of any placement and sign isn‚Äôt necessarily the same, and I‚Äôve read a number of times how these ‚Äúbig three‚Äù are written or talked about with the intention of finding an opinion of which one is the most effective or which ‚Äúmatters more‚Äù. I might do other analyzing posts like this one for Sun and Moon signs, and this one is for the Ascendant.

&nbsp;

The Ascendant is about how you see the world and how the world sees you. This is what these theoretical exaltations from ‚Äúgreatest to least‚Äù are based on. Again, this is superficial and there‚Äôs always more factors.

&nbsp;

1. Aries Ascendant (sees the world as a war zone, but likes to fight. fears relying on others and losing their independence / own opportunities)
2. Taurus Ascendant (sees the world as already peaceful, in a way. is logical and is self-nurturing, wants comfort and sees it as possible)
3. Gemini Ascendant (wants to be seen as smart and quick and sees the world as fun, exciting. fears losing curiosity and their knowledge)
4. Cancer Ascendant (believes the world is deep and emotional. sees the world as their home and fears feeling like they don‚Äôt belong anywhere)
5. Leo Ascendant (wants to rule the world with their ego and needs validation and attention. wants to be seen by the world and validated.)
6. Virgo Ascendant (focuses on details of the world before engaging with it, fears imperfection. needs to feel useful and knowledgeable)
7. Libra Ascendant (sees the world as a utopia and sees the never-ending potential of beauty the world has to offer. fears a lack of balance, chaos, and competition)
8. Scorpio Ascendant (sees the world as always wanting to hurt them. big issues with loss / fear of others ruining their life somehow)
9. Sagittarius Ascendant (sees life as an adventure and an extravagant experience. fears losing their sense of freedom)
10. Capricorn Ascendant (sees the world as a ladder to success and fears never fulfilling their duty and reaching a high social status)
11. Aquarius Ascendant (feels a need to never conform and always stay ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù / unique to feel like they matter)
12. Pisces Ascendant (views the world in a delusional way where all people aren‚Äôt as bad as they seem even if they are)

&nbsp;

I've come to find a lot of wiggle room and nuance in them. As Capricorn Season approaches, and all of us are inundated with the holiday season fervor, I looked first to the GOAT of the zodiac.)*  

You may wonder why Capricorn season corresponds with two of the biggest celebrations of the Western calendar year: Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Eve. And across different cultures, societies, and ethnicities many more celebrations occur during this time of year. So what is it about the Saturn-ruled, stoic goat that hints at anything but coldness, dryness or despair. Or in pop Astrology terms‚Äîthe workaholic. Seems more like Sagittarius‚Äô job to impart the gifts of conviviality. Centaurs were known, after all, for their rowdy parties, excess, and disregard for manners. Sounds suspiciously similar to the type of audience you‚Äôd encounter at a bar or club on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and the materialism you witness during Christmas. But it may surprise you to know that these correspondences are no accident, and rather point to a side of Capricorn rarely ever talked about: **the joyful and giving party animal**. Let‚Äôs look briefly at Saturn, Capricorn‚Äôs ruler.

Our modern Christmas bears historical similarities to the ancient Roman festival, *Saturnalia.* Held in honor of the god Saturn and on the Winter Solstice, *Saturnalia*, a week-long extravaganza, had all the typical signposts of the holiday season we know today: partying, gift giving, and masses of food. Plus, slaves were freed for the day, given agency to act how they pleased, and moral misgivings were not only forgiven, but encouraged (i.e. gambling). Some even describe the day as distinctly Mardi Gras (*named after the planet, Mars‚Äîbut that‚Äôs another topic for another day!)* in nature, with chaos bleeding through the streets. People dressed as crazily as they could, played raunchy games and chased people around. All this plus a bevy of booze. How, you ask, does this debauchery relate in any way to Saturn, Saturn who we know to preside ominously over law, order, and integrity? 

In Roman mythology, Saturn was said to rule over The Golden Age, a time of abundance and equality. Agriculture, and the seasonal structure of crop and bounty were taught to the Romans by Saturn. Saturn also gave them laws and societal structure, but not under the pretense of rigidity. Saturn was not tyrannical. Rather, Saturn established order, that there is a time and place for everything‚Äîincluding fun. And so in talking about Saturn‚Äôs rules and rigors, we must also acknowledge its lighter side, the satisfaction achieved through meeting those rules and rigors, and the justified celebration of a job well done. Here, Saturn is not like Jupiter, giver of gifts just for the sake of it, or excess in excess. *Saturnalia* was limited to a seven days. This should sound familiar‚ÄîSaturn restricts. But our modern view of Saturn leaves out the grace periods, seeing it only as an energy of work or hardship, unending. *Saturnalia* reframes this bias‚Äîwhere Saturn is measured and practical, so is it practical that life should be enjoyed.  Work hard, play hard‚Äîthat is optimal balance. We can see this concept mirrored through our understanding of The Saturn Return. A period of hard work and stress is then rewarded, usually through a sobered maturity, status, accomplished goals, economic gain or heightened responsibility‚Äîall things that serve to enrich life and make it more enjoyable, even if in the long run. And have you ever thought about the spelling of Saturday? It is Saturn‚Äôs day. Saturday can be a day of rest or leisure following the traditional Monday through Friday work week. (*I get paid on Saturdays, thanks Saturn!).* One last tidbit: the greeting during the festival of *Saturnalia* was ‚ÄúIo Saturnalia! Io, Io, Io!‚Äù Though yet proven, many believe this to be the root of Santa‚Äôs famous catchphrase, ‚ÄúHo, ho, ho!‚Äù Could Saturn be Santa Clause? Maybe. Saturn does represent, in some ways, the energy of an old man tallying up whether you‚Äôve been good or bad, and then rewarding you accordingly. Only now we can understand that Saturn doesn‚Äôt only give coals, but cherished gifts too.

Tied to the holiday season is also the idea of charity‚Äîbeing altruistic and spreading cheer, especially to people and communities of need. All this as the Sun makes its annual dalliance into a Saturn-ruled sign. The Scrooge? Think again. Saturn is concerned with equality and order, setting up structures (and safety nets) wherein outcasts (economic or otherwise) are brought out of the fray and into consideration. Giving to the needy, spreading happiness to the forlorn, spending time and energy on causes oft ignored the rest of the year-- these all speak to a Saturnian balance. So forget what you think you know about Saturn being the bad guy. His law and order often protect and serve those otherwise forgotten. And what good is holiday cheer if everyone hasn't the chance to be cheerful?

Related to the word Capricorn is *capricious*, given to fickleness, impulse, and unpredictability. Sounds distinctly un-Saturnian. Look at any video of a baby goat and you‚Äôll see it prancing, frolicking, and jumping around, as if free from worry or care. But it is precisely this changeable nature that can give Capricorn their surprisingly sharp humor or infectious happiness. So why is depression the only part of the spectrum ever talked about? Jump deeper into the history of Capricorn and you find gems that confront our modern understanding.  The Greek myth of Capricorn surrounds Pan, the God of the wilderness, music, always surrounded by nymphs. What a party. Pan did eventually turn himself into a sea goat, the horns of which were known as the *cornucopia* or ‚Äúthe horn of plenty‚Äù‚Äîanother allusion to abundance, bounty and pleasure. In some versions of the myth, Pan was erotic and seductive, teaching his practice of personal sexuality and fulfilment to others. Capricorn, especially its ruler Saturn, are talked about now in ways that appear to limit sexuality and intimacy. But let‚Äôs not forget that Capricorn is an Earth Sign, and particularly susceptible to sensuality in all forms. Statistically, sex in couples peaks during December and January‚ÄîCapricorn season (northern hemisphere). In Babylonian Astrology, Capricorn was known as the Goatfish, and had affinity with benevolent deities, one of which was called ‚Äúthe granter of requests‚Äù, a quality you‚Äôd hope for when making a Christmas or New Year‚Äôs resolutions list, and a quality we all imbue when giving Christmas gifts. Moreover, this Goatfish invented arts and crafts, and gave civilization modalities through which to enjoy and celebrate life.

Capricorns are said to age backwards. Born as old, serious and studious souls and eventually aging into childhood: play, joy, mischief. So always inherent in Capricorn is the propensity for pleasure and amusement. Even the presence of Saturn in our natal charts ferments and softens over time, or, let‚Äôs loose! So while the serious and hardworking, or even melancholic and sacrificial, side of Capricorn prevails and is correct, all things exist in polarity. Capricorn also brings the party, and corresponds astronomically to the point in time where the Sun starts to *gain* light. So look closely at the Capricorns in your life. You may find you can take some pointers from them about how to have fun and enjoy. And if you carry heavy Capricorn energy yourself‚Äîmake like the solstice and lighten up! You may find it easier than you think.

Every couple years, a story circulates about Ophiuchus, the zodiac having been shifted, your sign ""changing"", the new ""13th sign"", etc. Since so many articles are shared here about it which are blatantly inaccurate and poorly researched, this post is meant to clear up any confusion regarding this topic. It will be stickied for a while to guarantee visibility, and [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/3xe9yp/read_before_posting_faqrulestips/) has also been appended.

**Here's the short version:** No, the signs have not changed, nothing has shifted, your sign is the same, Ophiuchus is not a sign.

**[Here's the long version,](https://austincoppock.com/zodiacnews/)** which fully explains all the technical details.

**Here's the medium version:** Signs and constellations are not the same thing, though the signs were named after the constellations, hence the confusion. Signs are equal 30 degree divisions of the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic), constellations are named groups of stars which vary widely in size. The signs don't line up with the constellations and never have. Also, there's more than one zodiac. The tropical zodiac is what you're probably most familiar with as it's used most in the west, and its starting point is anchored on the spring equinox. The sidereal zodiac is based on the fixed stars, which is why it shifts with time due to the precession of the equinoxes - which, by the way, astrologers have known about the whole time, around 2000 years. 

So, nothing has changed. Same old signs! Please refrain from sharing articles about Ophiuchus, the ""new zodiac"", or any articles which perpetuate this inaccurate and frankly silly idea. Do your research and know your terminology, and share accurate information with your friends!

Sincerly,

In our response lies our growth and our happiness.‚Äù - Viktor Frankl,astrology,"Many times in this astrological community, I am seeing posts where people are blaming the planets.  For example, (I am making this one up) ""I have Mars in Gemini.  Is that why I have a hard time completing any projects?""  There seems to be a real misconception about astrology that I'd like to address.  *Planets and planetary placements, transits, progressions, synastry, composite, etc. just create conditions.* Once you can recognize the conditions, you can choose your response to them.  Here's an analogy:  You get a weather report that shows you that there is a 70% chance of rain later in the day.  You can choose to take an umbrella with you or bring a raincoat.  You can choose to ignore it.  You can pretend you don't hear the weather report, get caught in the rain, get soaked and then complain about it.  \* Learn to identify the conditions that the planets are creating both in your individual charts (really pay attention to how they manifest for you personally) and universally (as in planetary cycles, etc.) and then see that you have a choice about how to respond.  Mars in Gemini doesn't make you do anything.  It does give you gifts, talents, and predispositions, but how you use those is entirely up to you.

As a Sagittarius, my child-like nature is very prominent. This is always the first thing I notice about Gemini! Not to be confused with childish, which is totally different. Geminis carry the love of a child with the intelligence and intellect of an adult. They are kind, gentle and affectionate. On the other side, they have to try and balance this amazing ability to think with their loving side and try to process it all at once. Geminis are called over emotional, moody, and unable to be consistent. Personally I think one twin represents the love, happiness, kindness, and absolute wonder of a child. The other twin is the adult, nervous, anxious, and lost in thoughts. Gemini is one of the strongest signs because they have a constant battle between love and logic, and think so quickly that it can be hard to process at once. People don't take the time to appreciate how hard that is. I whole heartedly believe that Gemini is the most misunderstood sign in the zodiac.

&#x200B;

I will do them from the characters I understand the most to least.

&#x200B;

**Carrie**\-

*Sun= Gemini*

1. The obvious- is she is a writer.
2. One could even argue that her Mars is also in Gemini because she writes about sex, she is also quite experimental about sex and doesn't really feel any guilt towards being sexually active outside of a relationship. A lot of the sex she has is light-hearted and fun when she isn't serious about the man, to begin with. She has a lot of variety in the men she chooses to sleep with and doesn't attach the need for an emotional connection to every encounter she has.
3. She has lots of game when it comes to men due to her charming wit that is off the charts. She always knows the right thing to say even under pressure.
4. She overthinks a lot in true Gemini fashion.
5. She can be flaky- breaks it off with Big when they are about to leave on vacation- and often runs away from him- and from other situations too.
6. She has lots of acquaintances and loves mingling at parties.  She is NOT shy. She walks right up to people even when she is not comfortable. She has a youthful vibe to her in this way.
7. She loves a good gossip sesh
8. Her aesthetic is quirky, varied and colorful.

*Moon=Leo*

1. She craves affection and passion from the man she feels an emotional connection towards.
2. She wants to be in a relationship when she has true feelings for somebody, but she doesn't expect her independence or his to go away. She is actually pretty willing to take a lot more independence in relationships than a lot of other women are (cough cough... Mr. Big). Her goal is not to enmesh with Big, but to have a partnership where they can live their current lives hand-in-hand. This is a Leo thing- wanting to be King and Queen, both powerful, both committed, and both free to make their own choices.
3. Her emotional issues with Big are ego based.  She wants to feel prized by her partner and she adores and prizes her partner in return. When he isn't showing the affection she craves, she assumes its something wrong with her taking a hit to her self esteem. The ensuing hurt-ego issues cause her to take action without much thought- like showing up at his place to have a meltdown while demanding answers when she thinks he's hiding their relationship. Leo's worst nightmare is a partner who wants to hide them and not show them off.  Leos have a hard time letting things go when their ego is at stake- they want to prove to themselves that they are good enough and will work at something- in this case a relationship- that will pay off in an award- in this case, Big being fulling committed and adoring to her, to prove that she is worthy.
4. She can be impulsive when emotions run high. This includes buying expensive shoes- as Leos have a taste for luxury. A Leo moon wouldn't think twice about indulging their expensive addictions when feeling emotional in a bad way- as Carrie does. She also takes to partying and martini's- Leos love a good party to distract them.

&#x200B;

*Combo of both:* She is independent, affectionate, flirty, youthful and values a partnership with a man she can look up to. Commitment doesn't scare her if in the right circumstance. She needs to cultivate her own honest voice and needs the freedom to express herself- even if it's impulsive.

**Samantha:**

*Sun=Aries*

1. She is extremely independent. I know some people mistake her for a Leo, but Aries are less inclined to seek out affection and partnership than Leos.
2. She overshares in almost a braggy way. She pumps her self up, but she can get away with it as being endearing because well, she's an Aries.
3. She doesn't care what anybody thinks about her character because she is ""fabulous"". The only time you see her become vulnerable is during sexual rejection by men. This is because her identity has been tied up into her looks AKA physical body- which is what Aries represents. Yet, she bounces back really quickly and moves on to the next.
4. This brings us to the ego- Aries and Leo both have big egos but they show up differently. A Leo's ego needs more external input- if they aren't getting consistent assurance from others they take a hit to their self-esteem. They are a fixed sign- so they will fixate on this hit to the ego. Aries, on the other hand, goes out and gives themselves that validation through conquest- whether that be climbing mountains or collecting lovers. Aries are better at boosting their own ego than Leos. They are more like a hurt child when their ego is bruised, each ego hit doesn't last, and eventually, their self-confidence kicks back in and they look for something new- in true Cardinal sign form. To me, Samantha is more Cardinal than fixed, and this is why I think she is an Aries, not a Leo.
5. She is a boss lady with her own company.
6. She represents true carnal passion and is physical (Aries is a physical sign- as it represents the physical body) - and it's almost innocent- she loves sex for what it is and she doesn't have an agenda when seeking sex. She gets caught in the moment and jumps in without thinking. This is very Aries. I also think she has a Taurus Mars. She likes beautiful men or men with the ability to buy beautiful things (Taurus is ruled by Venus- all about beauty). She is also extremely sensual- not just desires sex but likes sex to be an experience of all the senses.
7. Her aesthetic is red hot (literally wears lots of red) and risk√© in an expensive way. 

&#x200B;

*Moon= Aquarius*

1. Emotionally she is cold. She is not a fan of the warm and fuzzies.
2. She is fundamentally not the status quo of what a woman ""should"" be- and that is represented for all to see by how her Aries sun plays out. Aquarius is always different, and when the moon falls here it isn't a choice for the native. Being different, however that may be,  is simply their nature.
3. She is unapologetically herself and the idea of compromising her authenticity repulses her.
4. Even though she is carnal and focused on the physical in sex and relationships- she is able to philosophize her reasons for it. Instead of feeling the feels she intellectualizes and puts them up for debate.
5. She is truly caring for the group- that's where she allows her emotional displays. Her circle and not her individual one-on-one relationships is where she gets her emotional satisfaction.

&#x200B;

*Combo of both:* She is confident, independent, bold, passionate, authentic and unique. She has few vulnerabilities but is able to rely on her confidence to get through anything.  Commitment is not for her because what she values from her experience with the opposite sex is hedonistic. Emotions don't trip her up. She gets the emotional support she needs from her friends.

&#x200B;

Charlotte-

*Sun= Cancer*

1. She romanticizes emotional relationships based on love, children and domestic life while she puts sex second- yet can get freaky in the right situations.
2. She is sweet and naive which is why she attracts quintessential fuckboys. She can put up with weird stuff for a while before saying goodbye.
3. She is into art and creative expression- works at a gallery.
4. She does not have much of an ego. She is so focused on creating a connection with her partner that she isn't thinking about what her partner is thinking of her.
5. Can leverage emotional intimacy to manipulate people- sleeping with her old friend and handyman to keep him around when he feels like moving away or withholding sex in attempts to keep men interested on an emotionally intimate level.
6. I think she has Pisces Mars as she bases her want for sex on an emotional connection and prefers sweet emotionally available men.
7. Her aesthetic is a touch whimsical and feminine.

*Moon=Libra*

1. This touches on her aesthetic too- she has refined tastes especially about her home, which the moon rules over. This also touches on that √ºber classy femininity she has. ""Aesthetics matter to me."", she said- which is so Libra. Also affects why she works at a gallery- she feels at home (moon), so to speak, around beautiful things.
2. Even though she values emotions- she is not particularly highly emotional. She can even be flighty with her emotions. She'll be all gooey over a guy but once shes had it with his weird sexual quirks shes out without a tear shed. Cancer's can have a hard time letting go- but when she breaks up with a guy she can control when she gets over them with an ""equation"". That is not totally true for some Cancers who have sticky emotions. I think the Libra moon balances this out.
3. She is not emotionally satisfied unless she has a one-on-one partnership- she desperately wants it. She is partnership oriented in true Libra fashion.
4. She loves to mingle and loves romance in her relationships.

&#x200B;

*Combo of both*: She is feminine, classy, dreamy, soft-spoken, relationship-oriented and has a love of the arts. She values emotions but doesn't let emotional issues get her down due to her unwavering optimist for romance and true love. She is caring, kind, and not afraid of intimacy romantic or otherwise.

&#x200B;

**Miranda:**

*Sun= Capricorn*

1. She is an attorney and has high aspirations to gain power in her firm by becoming a partner and is willing to pretend to be a lesbian just to get invited into the ""boys club"".. very Capricorn.
2. When it comes to sex it can be very much about the act and getting off, and less about passion and romance.  believe her Mars is in Virgo. She is picky about her men and sex life and isn't particularly precious about it.
3. She is less ego-driven and more accomplishment-driven.
4. She views marriage as more of a power struggle where women lose power.
5. She is picky and critical when it comes to men and life in general.
6. She likes structure, order and enjoys having ""limits"". Ex: Her ""free Saturdays"" that she has all planned out with errands and chores which she enjoys doing, which also may be attached to how she executes a plan which is related to Virgo Mars.
7. Her aesthetic is practical and understated when it comes to displaying her sexuality or feminity- its almost masculine. One could say this is to strengthen her appearance os power.

&#x200B;

Moon= Saggitarius

1. She is outspoken when she feels emotional- and often relies on humor. But she isn't highly emotional in general.
2. She needs a level of freedom in her relationships. She struggles with the pros and cons of commitment. She sees the benefit of having a good relationship but has a hard time seeing herself in one that meets her standards because she easily feels restricted by them.
3. She enjoys the country- Sag loves nature.
4. She can be a bit impulsive at times (mostly by speaking out about the truth). But I think this is tempered by her earth sun.
5. She too can philosophize her emotions. That is why she and Samantha can go back and forth in conversation about dating and agree on a lot of it. Sag and Aqua get on like that.

&#x200B;

Combo of both: She is ambitious, practical, truthful with a tendency to be hot-headed. She wants to have a ""person"" but struggles with commitment as she views it as handing over her power because she values her freedom even if it means the ability to freely create structure and limits on her own terms. She strikes a fine balance between practical cynicism about dating and enough optimism to keep trying anyway.

&#x200B;

**Mr. Big:**

*Sun Sign= Aquarius*

1. He is detached.
2. He is unpredictable.
3. He is caring but not in a direct way.
4. He can be quite flaky

&#x200B;

*Moon Sign= Scorpio*

1. He has an emotional intensity despite being detached.
2. He is sexually passionate and seems to have a deep need for sexual connection- no matter who with.
3. He is mysterious and secretive especially about how he feels.

&#x200B;

*Combo of both:* He is detached, aloof, and magnetic. He has a need for relationships and connections yet he holds people at an arm's length. He is hesitant to jump head first into romance as he seems to know the depths he can go to- and might be afraid of it because of situations in his past (ex-wife).

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

Carrie: Sun= Gemini, Moon= Leo

Samantha: Sun=Aries, Moon= Aquarius

Charlotte: Sun=Cancer, Libra=Moon

Miranda: Sun=Capricorn, Moon=Sagitarrius

Mr. Big: Sun=Auqarious, Moon=Scorpio

Starting off this transit we have [***Saturn retrograde in Capricorn***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/saturn-retrograde-in-capricorn-horoscope-april-29-september-18/) **sextile Neptune**, bringing the support of father figures and superiors into this lifting fog. You can rest assured you will have strong support through this trial. With [***Jupiter retrograde in Sagittarius***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/10/jupiter-retrograde-in-sagittarius-horoscope-april-10th-august-11th/) making a **square** to **Neptune**, however, be mindful that you should not trade one addiction for another. You may be tempted to trade a smoking addiction for a gambling addiction, for example.

This is a great time to delve into spiritual pursuits, such as divination or meditation, to help you move forward and heal with clarity now at your disposal. This is going to be a gentle reminder that we cannot run away from our pasts forever, and that we must find a healthy way to overcome our fears and paranoias.

The mysterious shadows in the fog are often more frightening than their true forms.

764,aok2zk,False,None,56,Reframing Aquarius: How the Cool & Detached Can Offer Us Our Best Chance at Love.,astrology,"(*I started looking the archetypes of the signs and reframing how we have come to view them as strictly this or strictly that. I've come to find a lot of wiggle room and nuance in them. This time, I talk about Aquarius, romance, love and Valentine's Day. To read my reframing of Capricorn,* [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/a449d4/reframing_capricorn_how_the_serious_seriously/) )

Like Capricorn and Christmas, Aquarius and Valentine‚Äôs Day seem to be fundamentally at odds. Where the serious Saturn-ruled earth sign seems incongruous to merrymaking, so does the Saturn-ruled air sign seem an out-of-place home for one of the more *romantic* days of the year. If pop Astrology had its way, Aquarius would remain inextricably associated with stereotypes of distance and detachment. While those descriptors are certainly relevant, they are not the end of the story~~.~~  You may find Taurus or Libra more fitting for Valentine‚Äôs Day, where the planet of love and romance is home. Or Pisces, where the planet of love and romance is exalted. Perhaps even Leo, where bouquets of red and pink balloons and Leo-ruled heart-shaped boxes of candy proudly boast and roar: *love!* But in removing the superficial layers that surround the misunderstood Aquarius, we can come to understand why Cupid‚Äôs foray through this cerebral sign is no accident, and rather points us towards a more fitting, yet shocking, conclusion: that the Aquarius love is deep and endless, that the Aquarian heart throbs with undiluted passion. If this shocks you, good. Aquarius enjoys a revolution. And so may this revolution set Aquarius free from misinformation, and set ablaze a new way of thinking.

Where Taurus makes love physical, Libra makes love artful and Pisces makes love dreamy‚ÄîAquarius makes love *ideal.* In any working definition of the word *romance*, ‚Äúidealized love‚Äù makes a literal or alluded appearance. It can be said, then, that from Aquarius, the *idea* of love is born and celebrated. And from ideas, all things sprout. This isn‚Äôt altogether odd. Aquarius deals with intellect and logic. And ruled by Saturn, striving towards lasting standards of excellence and fairness, signposts of anything ideal, lines up with what we know about the archetype. So in enhancing love to its most ideal place, the Aquarius romance comes with a bigger heart and bigger mission. As a humanitarian sign, Aquarius is not particular about love‚Äî who deserves it, who is giving it, why it went away, when it‚Äôll come, how it looks, etc. With the power of scope and objectivity, Aquarius love transcends physical limitations and instead becomes a universal concept under which all of humankind can shelter. And what could be more romantic, more loving, than the unrelenting acceptance Aquarius offers? And so where things aren‚Äôt sensual enough for Taurus, refined enough for Libra, or magical enough for Pisces‚ÄîAquarius asks no price of admission, for love to them remains priceless, a public good to be doled out and shared not on pretense, but on brotherhood. It is Aquarius‚Äôs love of humankind and fraternity that expands the concept of love: come one, come all, and come as you are. 

Saint Valentine of Rome, whose written account has come to serve as a historical template for the beginnings of Valentine‚Äôs Day, acted out these Aquarian ideals. He performed weddings for those forbidden to marry and when sent to jail, healed his jailer‚Äôs daughter of blindness. Afterwards and right before he was due to be executed, he sent a letter to the jailer‚Äôs daughter, and signed it, *your Valentine.* Saint Valentine of Rome was also said to give out paper hearts while ministering to people about God‚Äôs love, and a direct line can be drawn from this action to the typical Valentine‚Äôs Day decorations we see today. In this brief tale, we meet two Aquarian archetypes, the former more recognizable than the latter: rebellion and compassion. A humanitarian thing to do despite the laws of the time, Saint Valentine, though perhaps not an Aquarius himself, extolled all of the best, yet often ignored testaments of the sign‚Äîthe push towards equality, that all deserve to have their love legitimized and recognized, endless empathy for the human condition, and the Love with a capital L that drives one to such measures. Religion aside, Valentine lived and died on one principal: that love, in all its myriad forms, is for all. Anyone who dies for love is a romantic to me. That the Sun was travailing through Aquarius as the framework for our modern conception of Valentine‚Äôs Day was underway can be no coincidence. All of Astrology bears correspondence to human events, even if they remain obscured or misunderstood for a time. But let‚Äôs mount more evidence...

In Ancient Greece, Aquarius season coincided with *Gamelion*, the month of marriage. Two festivals occurred then, roughly translated to *Sacred Wedding* and *Divine Wedding.* These festivals celebrated the union of Zeus and Hera. In Roman texts, Hera was known as Juno, the goddess of marriage. If Juno sounds familiar, it is because an asteroid was named after her and has come to represent what is looked for in marriage and commitment. Modern natal chart calculators can show where Juno is in the sky for the native, and most often it points to the characteristics of a most suitable long-term partner. So what is it about Aquarius that corresponds to these cultivations of lasting love and marriage? Look to the element and modality: fixed air. Like any fixed sign, Aquarius holds on tight and when best expressed can exalt the virtues of *fidelity.* Of course, any ideal marriage or partnership needs this brand of loyalty and perseverance. Though much is said about the Aquarius need for space, even the Aquarius need for isolation, it cannot be overlooked that when in love, Aquarius is one of the more steadfast partners, seeking not for frivolous union, but for deep connection. But the elemental structure of Aquarius sets it apart from the rest of the fixed family. It can be said that inherent in the Aquarian archetype are two life-sustaining elements: air, and water, as Aquarius is the water-bearer, often mistaken by novices as a water sign. No living being can do without air or water. And so the Aquarian love is life-sustaining, from which all bounty and blessings grow, from which all beings benefit. It is the grandeur of this concept that gives Aquarius its aloof quality‚Äîtheir love is so universal and welcoming that to the casual observer, it appears impersonal. But it is precisely the scope of Aquarius love that makes it so palpable, an equally matched breadth and depth. Where fixed Taurus can become materialistic, fixed Leo can become self-aggrandizing, and fixed Scorpio can brood and become paranoid, no more fixed is Aquarius than the air it represents: ubiquitous, self-sustaining, stretched over distance yet deeply intimate, as oxygen and the connectivity of breath is shared by all. Co-dependency has long reigned as a romantic model of love, clinginess and self-dissolution perversely used as measures of affection. Psychology has now caught up and identified this proclivity as self-sabotaging and unhealthy. The Aquarius model of live and let live in love can appear threatening to the osmosis some wish to experience, or expect to experience. But it offers us our best chance of healthy love‚Äîas when air is squelched out of the equation, breathing becomes labored, and the life of the relationship is threatened. When inserted in mutually consented amounts, air allows for space, wherein two individuals (or more, \*wink\*) can fully stretch out into their identity, their lived experience, always feeling supported, but never entrapped. That is what Aquarius offers‚Äîa love given the air to float, fly, and transcend.

In a sense, and as alluded to above, Aquarius love can be cerebral. But as all things start with thought, this isn‚Äôt to be feared. The belief of a thing creates the experience of a thing. So for Aquarius to hold you in their minds with love and affection is to tap into a potent creative energy, one that serves as the basis for all emotion and action. Intellect has no bounds. Neither do the Aquarius flights of fancy. And because these ideas are *fixed,* good luck changing the Aquarian mind. Once loved, always loved. For Aquarius, the idea of love for a person, up close or from afar, is to render that love timeless and shapeless, graduated out the physical dimensions of gift-giving, face-time and attention, and into an ethereal experience. Aquarius is the sign of freedom and independence. To give love the freedom to expand, to individuate, untethered by expectation or precedent, is to experience ecstasy. 

Aquarius is ruled by Saturn. There is, then, a resonance with Aquarius and Saturn‚Äôs sign of exaltation‚ÄîLibra. Libra, in some ways, is the sign of marriage, one-on-one partnership, diplomacy, and fairness. Therefore, there is a through-line connecting the idea of peaceful partnership and love to the Aquarius archetype. With this link, Saturn, and by virtue, Aquarius, can delight when relationships become stable and enduring, planting fertile ground for love and romance to blossom perennially. 

In sum, I invite you to reframe what you‚Äôve heard about Aquarius. Leave room for the wondrous ways in which this sign offers us our best chance at experiencing a true love, and hold space for a history that can corroborate it. Remember that as the water bearer, Aquarius has within it all the emotional capacity apparent in any other sign. Only, unlike any other sign, Aquarius shoulders these emotional conditions with impenetrable strength and understanding, turning them into nutrient, tilling human soil, watering it with compassion. In this alchemical process, all human experience, the sordid and splendid, meet their highest resolution in the arms of Aquarius. It is this level of belonging, of feeling seen and heard, that allows unbridled love to flow. It could be that the Aquarius tendency for distance and austerity is merely erected as a means of protection. That the love they feel for others must somehow be contained behind a wall, less it completely overwhelm them, less their waters drown the world. But do not be mistaken‚Äîbeyond the ideas of coldness and detachment lies a soft, loving center. A sweetness disguised, but always alive.

*‚ÄúLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind*  
 *And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.‚Äù*

The big issue isn't so much that Mars enters Aries, it's that Mars STAYS in Aries for some time - and it does indeed square the Jupiter/Saturn/Pluto combination.

Back in March, when the lockdowns were starting, Mars was conjoining them - in its exaltation, but disposited by Saturn nevertheless.  This time it's *squaring* them, in its domicile, and disposits itself.  So the energy is different, more at cross-purposes with Jupiter/Saturn/Pluto than working together with them.

What this suggests to me is that **even if** a second wave of COVID-19 breaks out (I suspect there won't be, but if there is, it would probably happen in October), people *won't* be peacefully staying at home the way they mostly were during the first wave.

In the U.S., what we are probably seeing *right now* is the effect of the May 22 lunation with Mars (ruling, among other things, violence) in the 6th house (ruling, among other things, police, and given its traditional connotation with ""servants"" it would seem to touch on class issues, which in the U.S. often means racial issues as well).

cancer :: frodo ‚Äî the calm in the storm, pretty laidback and relaxed in even the most unideal situations, pretty kept to himself and doesn‚Äôt enjoy conflict but he‚Äôs determined af. he‚Äôs hesitant with gollum at first but overtime accepts him into their clan with a nurturing attitude. also he has those big watery eyes 

leo :: gimli ‚Äî loud and proud, warm-hearted and funny!!!! a little prideful and stubborn, doesn‚Äôt want anyone to see his failures or shortcomings so he puts up a lil bit of a facade but hes incredibly loyal and he‚Äôs willing to fight for those who he loves. HAIRY AF

virgo :: arwen ‚Äî delicate mannerisms, pure intentions and an eye for detail. gives up her immortality for her love (living up to the 6h act of service or duty) a natural healer!!!!! she seems very innocent on the surface but she‚Äôs lowkey an elvish warrior bad bish 

libra :: lady galadriel ‚Äî the peacemaker, a divine source of light who‚Äôs able to overrule all types of conflict. the fucking epitome of venusian energy, she basically has gandalf wrapped around her finger with her feminine magnetism LMAO

scorpio :: aragorn ‚Äî he‚Äôs mysterious as fuck and he tends to rub people the wrong way or intimidate them only because they can‚Äôt figure him out, intense energy, literally summons the army of dead to fulfil an oath to the mortal (???? this is eighth house as fuck)

sagittarius ::  bilbo ‚Äî adventurous, fun loving lil hobbit, always longing for a taste of adventure or a new experience, never wants to grow old, can sometimes come off a lil harsh or incoherent (queue his birthday speech LMAO)

Hates being politically correct. ‚ÄúFuck your feelings‚Äù. Cynical when it concerns others, optimistic when it comes to themselves. Black and red. Physically resilient. Self-involved. Doesn‚Äôt fear death. Doesn‚Äôt believe in others. Selfish but they believe their justified because they see others as selfish too. Will snap at the drop of a hat. Will self-destruct and hurt everyone around them if they don‚Äôt care. Warriors in every sense. On the inside very scared but is aggressive to compensate. TOO INTENSE AND PASSIONATE. Sex with them is probably an experience. You might have to tell them to calm down in bed lol. Lose themselves in sex, work, and their ambitions easily. People don‚Äôt fuck with them. are childlike softies at heart. Can actually be happy and social but gets tired easily doing that. This is my mars and it‚Äôs incredibly accurate)

*Mars in Taurus*: Sensual, physically appealing, patient, chill, careful, stubborn, and possessive. (In detriment because Taurus traits do not come in handy when trying to tackle issues head on because Taurus is a more steady, feet on ground type of sign and really wouldn‚Äôt mesh well with Scorpio/Aries as an ascendant. Probably loves sex and intimacy. Very patient. Silent. Smile in your face but they know whats up. Suspicious of others so they‚Äôre probably distant but are relaxed overall. Could have very quiet, deep, and beautiful voices idk. Probably hefty or a little on the heavy side.)

*Mars in Gemini*: Talkative, mentally agile, argumentative, restless, friendly to many, close to no one, and mischievous. (Mars in Gemini with Scorpio risings could be veeerrry good at lying. Like extremely good. When mad, they probably will say some seriously fucked up shit. Liars. Scheming. Won‚Äôt steal from you outright, but will probably tell you a lie to get your money. Cheaters. ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs a game but it‚Äôs not fair, I‚Äôll break the rules and I won‚Äôt care.‚Äù Will say some fucked up shit just to get a reaction out of you. Funny dark humor. Always up to no good.)

*Mars in Cancer*: Persistent, strong-willed but not imposing, touchy, protective of those you love, family oriented, reserved, security-oriented (in fall because cancer traits does not do well when forced to interact with the outside world. Mars in cancers with Scorpio risings tend to be verry introverted to the point where it‚Äôs scary. Silent. Fuck with their loved ones and they‚Äôll see to it that you‚Äôll pay. Manipulators from behind the scenes. Probably get others to do dirty work for em. Offputting in public.)

*Mars in Leo*: Flamboyant, ego-driven, masculine, cheerful, friendly, funny, dramatic, and generous (Leos with Scorpio risings tend to pride themselves on being the ‚Äúlight of the world‚Äù. They kind of feel like it‚Äôs their duty to make people happy in this dark and cruel world. My mars is in fifth house so I can vouch lol. Won‚Äôt beat around the bush when interacting with others. If you make them angry the whole world will know. Not as bad as mars Aries with Scorpio rising because Leo‚Äôs are overall more chill but still it‚Äôs probably best not to fuck with em. They look more imposing than Aries with Scorpio rising too. Well-built and muscular. Contained in themselves. PASSIONATE. Hates that they love love. Wants attention but at the same time will be relatively silent. This probably will be evident in their flashy but dark clothing style. Black and gold. Will make black flashy and glamorous. 

*Mars in Virgo*: Calculating, nit-picky, practical, logical, detail-oriented, responsible, and conservative. (Virgo mars ppl with Scorpio risings ain‚Äôt fun at parties. In fact don‚Äôt take them anywhere. I swear they will point out every flaw both physical and personal with everything they come into contact with. You‚Äôll genuinely wonder how they‚Äôre even able to smile or laugh cuz all they seem to do is be so negative about everything. Venus or mercury in a positive sign would offset these tendencies tho)

*Mars in Libra*: Diplomatic, feminine, non-confrontational, graceful, tactful, possibly physically good-looking, and emotionally distant. (In detriment in mars cuz libran traits don‚Äôt do well when going after what you want. Mars Libras with Scorpio risings tend to be in denial about how they see the world and try to see it more positively but, due to that denial, the unfortunate things that keep happening to them repeatedly prove them otherwise. They want to be beautiful in this ugly, cruel world.

*Mars in Scorpio*: Cruel, reserved, mysterious, blunt, honest, passive-aggressive, ambitious, and very sexual. (Dignified because scorpio traits can help you when trying to go after what you want, or when trying to just get by. Mars Scorpios with Scorpio risings are kinda tragic imo. Like every Scorpio rising they probably found out that the world isn‚Äôt what they thought it was but instead of being direct and confrontational with the world like Aries with Scorpio asc, they‚Äôve become what they fear in the world in order to survive. These natives are way better at hiding their soft side compared to aries with Scorpio asc, because they‚Äôve lost themselves in their own world. They dont force themselves upon anything like an Aries w/ Scorpio asc would. They just... survive by becoming their enemy. Very sad. they could also be the exact opposite due to Scorpios tendency to be very extreme. Not necessarily happy go lucky, but content with themselves and their animal instincts. They may embrace their animalistic side and see nothing wrong with it. Dark humor. Could view society as too secretive and mysterious. 

*Mars in Sagittarius*: Cheerful, jolly, lucky, friendly, detached, honest, goofy, and wise (Sagittarius with Scorpio risings tend to want to make people lighten up around them because they know how fucked up the world can be however they don‚Äôt pride themselves on it like Leo mars with Scorpio asc would. They just want to share their happiness with this cruel world.

*Mars in Capricorn*: Reserved, logical, hardworking, responsible, ambitious, patient, and unemotional (exalted cause Capricorn traits have the native do enough to achieve his goals but not necessarily flourish as fast as  like Scorpio and Aries because of their patience and slowness, however they probably won‚Äôt make as many mistakes as them either. Mars Capricorn‚Äôs with Scorpio asc tend to be very detached from people and focused on their work. However if they like you they‚Äôll stick by you no matter what. They probably choose not to go out much and aren‚Äôt necessarily buzz kills. They‚Äôre just kinda grumpy and awkward.

*Mars in Aquarius*: emotionally Detached, logical, unemotional yet considerate of others in their groups, talkative, unique in their own ways, very chill, and friendly. (Mars in Aquarius with Scorpio risings tend to be so damn chill and funny to be around. Very witty people. But also very detached like they fear getting serious with people. But they‚Äôll talk about societal issues with so much passion cuz that Scorpio Ascendant has a hand in how they see the world.)

*Mars in Pisces*: Emotional, sensitive, empathetic, kind, adaptable, hospitable, and somewhat physically detached from human beings. (I honestly don‚Äôt know why this position isn‚Äôt falling in mars. These people are worse than libras and Taurus when it comes to trying to live on their own and they can be easily taken advantage of due to their kind nature. INTUITIVE AS FUCK. PSYCHIC. will be able to tell what‚Äôs wrong with you EASILY. To the point where it‚Äôs scary. These people need to be protected. ESPECIALLY if their rising sign is in scorpio. Scorpio risings already see the world as too much for them but couple that with a mars in Pisces and this combo can make this person very depressed. Mars Pisces with Scorpio risings could avoid the world altogether and just be drug addicts or monks or something. These people know how weak they could Be to others so they need ppl by their side at all costs. Not even that, but these ppl NEED some type of emotional support when shit gets real for them. And it does. Often. They also need to have a good home probably with some good books or movies or something to get their mind off shit. Love these ppl tho Pisces are so cool

There is indeed also an relation with the Eagle (Scorpio has been described also as an Eagle and Snake).

804,aswfby,False,None,138,Water signs,astrology,"I am drawn to water signs. So many men I have loved and known are water sign folks. Handful of Scorpio and Pisces people that I love and hold dear in my heart. But it has never been smooth as I would have expected. These are supposed to be the emotional guys! I always found myself still unable to tap into their emotional quotient or potential. I have even gone as far as wondering how I misjudged these folks. 

Today, it clicked. It clicked to me that most of these men and women lack air. That means they feel all these emotions but they have no idea how to express it or communicate it. Communication has always been a hindrance I have had with my dearest water signs. I understand it now, I think. I want to offer them some of my air qualities that most of these dominate water sign charts need. It must be hard, to not be able to freely communicate. 

This is eye opening to me, something so simple that didn't occur to me till this date. I don't know what the antidote is. I suppose similar can be said about Earth and Fire. Even though water/air and earth/fire are seen incompatible, much needed lessons can only be learnt from the incompatible signs. 

Edit to add: Of course, we all walk around with some glasses on. I have lot of air in my chart and I always assumed everyone was comfortable talking or even wanted to talk. It literally blows my mind at times that people don't want to talk things out and sort things out. Until I started hanging out dominant water charts. Maybe this is my moment of ""OH, maybe it doesn't work that way"". Some are happy the way they are, some are looking to bring more balance by bringing all elements. Whatever your story is, it has been great reading all the perspectives. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/aswfby/water_signs/,117,"I am a pisces sun, leo moon, gemini asc. 

I love this combination, it makes me very open and confident and not overconfident or to a narcissistic point where I need all the attention. 

I have had the most awkward conversations with strangers in the most unlikely places and have made lasting friendships with them thanks to my gemini communicating skills.

My pisces sun controls these two signs. The only downside is when Leo gets hurt I become explosive and full of pride like Poseidon! 

And Gemini is like a teasing fairy. It kicks in when I need my concentration the most and whatever I am doing at the moment it changes completely ten minutes later. 

So if I‚Äôm on the computer finishing some work I might find myself twenty minutes later drinking a coffee with some stranger and then again one hour later at the cinema and then suddenly reminding myself I had to finish the job on the computer. It basically turns me into a procrastinating god. 

Good thing is these three make a very intelligent being. So I can still come back and finish the job on time. 

I consider myself a more evolved pisces because when I read about the characteristics of pisces and their uncontrollable emotional nature I can‚Äôt relate at all. I am very empathic and I‚Äôm always attentive to others. Which some people see as a ‚Äúweakness‚Äù. 

One of the things I love of being a pisces is the ability to live in parallel dimensions or dreams with full blown adventures. I can create the most unimaginable worlds and literally live there and at the same time be here present at the moment. Sometimes it gets a bit out of my hands and I might seem disassociating but I still am present. 

When I am in love my full attention goes to the person I‚Äôm in love with. I might be a bit overwhelming with the power of love and I have had girlfriends being madly in love with me but needing a break from so much freaking love [you see I used the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù like a gazillion times]. This attention I give is different from being clingy. I do like my space as well and absolutely need my solo time. 

What I give is too deep for some to hold up. I am hardcore faithful and will never ever cheat on anyone.  But then again I can ghost someone like a king without feeling any remorse and if I‚Äôm being hurt (like deeply hurt) I disappear from your life in a heartbeat. 

When we are young we might suffer from multiple personality disorder but as time passes all these personalities merge into one.  I think we are the perfect liars we know the mechanisms of a lie and how to make it so convincing we believe it ourselves. We would make the perfect spy. 

You‚Äôll typically see a Pisces engaged in some sort of spiritual activity or being all into conspiracy, illuminati, lizards aliens, Mandela effect theories. I am myself very much into Theosophy and Hermeticism. And due to our emotional empathy we can often times vibrate in the mental, emotional and energetic frequency fields of others. 

Well those are my two cents. Basically it all depends on your education, the environment where you grew up and the combination of the astral positions of your planets.  ",2019-02-21 00:50:48

Her health wasn't great but not too awful so it was surprising when she died in July, 2019. She died 7 days after her 70th birthday. Her birthday is 7/7, sp she died on 7/14. She was the quintessential Cancer momma, I was so blessed. So here's what's been bugging me. In January of 2019 I was trying to encourage her to become a youtube astrologer so she made a few videos for the Cancer full moon that month. She wasn't too into it so only made a few and I thought to myself ""when she dies those videos will be my treasures."" But then I stopped myself from thinking that bc she wasn't that unwell and I thought why am i thinking she's going to die? I'm juat being negative and morbid. 

 She died at the Cancer New Moon. Since that happened i've had to scramble to completely reshuffle my life. I inherited her house and everything and I've been redoing the floors, purging her things, rearranging and handling all the financial and legal matters so that everything is ok for my SO to move in. So when the Cancer Full Moon comes back, everyhtign will finally be handled and I will have fully transitioned to a life without her (except the grieving part which will be forever most likely). 

When I think back to January 2019, when i watch those videos I can't help but wonder....how did I somehow know this was all going to happen? She did die and those videos are my treasures and it all coincided with the Cancer moons, her sign. She gave me a home, which i own outright--how canacer is that?? And How perfect is is all? How can i feel sad when everything is so perfectly in line? Since she's been gone these weird syncronicities keep happening that give me the willies but in a good way, like she really is still with me even though I can't see her or touch her....does anyone else have stories like this?

810,hjlwgy,False,Modern,18,"Neptune Retrograde in Pisces: anxiety, discomfort, and potential scandals.",astrology,"As of June 23 of this year, Neptune went retrograde in its home of Pisces. Now lately, I was noticing some things which made me wonder what in the world was going on. June ended on such a weird note that I had to do some research on what was going on.

In my immediate life, I noticed that a lot of people were starting to be either ""exposed"" or quite a few people started to show their true colors. The company I work for is one of the largest companies on the planet and when the lockdowns went into place and people took the outbreak seriously, our CEO and leadership told us to not worry and that they will be understanding. Not long after that, right around the time of the retrograde, a good bit of people in results-centered positions got an email from the CEO saying that the lockdowns are no excuse to have bad results.

I also started to notice that in my immediate social circle, people who had a higher status, were respected, and seen in a favorable started having a more modern-age witch hunt going against them. In some cases, the witch-hunt was warranted as we found that a couple of people had been playing up a lie. In other cases, we found that the witch-hunts exposed the envy of people who seemed to be friends with the given person.

**So what is going on with Neptune?**

Neptune represents the imagination, desire to escape from reality, dreams, and the quest for the ideal. On the negative side, Neptune is also associated with deception, delusion, and governs things like escapism. In Pisces, Neptune sits in its domicile. What we see is that Neptune rules idealism at its best and deception at its worst, yet there is a root to it all, when it goes retrograde then things were not as they seemed.

*Retrograde Neptune. In other words, time to get real.*

Think back a year, in many ways, things were actually pretty good if you were say an American. The economy was powerful, jobs plentiful, and things were looking up. Many people I know took this all for granted but just like bad times, good times do not really last that long. We were a bit blinded by it all, perhaps a bit delusional in what we could actually do.

We were going to do all these unrealistic things like start our own business and be millionaires by the end of the year, get that job we were truly unqualified for, and chase our wildest dreams. In many ways, we were out of touch and the good times kind of softened a lot of us. Maybe we took one too many risks that were unwarranted and not based on logic because obviously, the economy and everything is going to remain good for so long.

Perhaps we thought that the one friend we made is such a cool and trustworthy person. Maybe we were a bit too trusting and let our guards down, now as it went retrograde, the reality sat in. Perhaps that good pal of yours that you made was not saying such positive things about you behind your back. Maybe that person wanted to be your friend for an ulterior motive.

**Remember what pain, anxiety, and worry feels like? Well, it is going to turn up until late November.**

Yeah, at one point you felt so invincible through it all, everything was going to be okay. Things like anxiety, worries, sleepless nights, and that gut wrenching feeling of your life going down a path you wish it was not going down? Well, they were probably not as present in the past times but man are they making a come back in these next few months. 

Oh how you wanted that nervousness to be over and done with. How you were so happy that the very thing whether it was a critical event or a relationship that gave you jitters and goosebumps got magically resolved. Whether it was due to dumb luck, an act of the Heavens, or something going in your favor, it ended up getting resolved. 

Once it got resolved, you got back to your ""normal life"".

**But what if this one is actually a call to change your reaction to such events and yourself instead of letting dumb luck take care of it?**

Maybe that rumor about the one time you posted a mean tweet which you deleted out of fear was spread but it kind of died out. Perhaps that one time you constantly talked crap about people you hated behind their backs never really came back to you. How that one time you made the wrong kind of friend who almost fucked up your life but you got out just in the right moment, mainly due to sheer luck.

Boy oh boy though, I bet you were *worried* about those times weren't you? You were probably a bit anxious that the one thing you were guilty of or failed to get right might come back to you. Somehow though, it all kind of faded away.

This is a time to not avoid tough times or unflattering things about yourself. Rather, this is the time to change yourself for good. Change how you react to those scary goosebump inducing situations that focus on your life. Learn to change your daily habits that are not productive. Evaluate relationships that are amounting to little and break free from them. 

Stop kidding yourself and thinking that you are shielded from the harshness of life or that it is all ""going to be okay"", it is going to be okay when you make it okay by changing yourself. In other words, get real with *yourself*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/hjlwgy/neptune_retrograde_in_pisces_anxiety_discomfort/,113,u/pisces0317 ,2020-07-01 23:37:04

I have traveled around the sun enough times to have come to the startling revelation that when you are in the sun, your body is exposed to the rays for longer, which has an effect on your internal clock. Your internal clock controls your aging so essentially the closer to the sun you get the slower you will age. While you are further away from the sun, your body temperature is lower, which slows down your metabolism and makes you slower to the same extent as your body temperature goes down, and your internal clock is affected by lower ambient temperatures.


The more I think about it, the more I think it's the same reason the sun is a bit higher and the air is a bit lower. To notice these things you have to take the time to stand still and observe things around you, and you will notice things. But while you are noticing these things you are aging relative to your distance from the sun. If the sun were to disappear, I'd think that the human clocks would also slow down or even stop working. You would be frozen in time, probably looking up at the sky wondering where the light went.


This all leads me to one prediction I have been making for what is to come in the not-so-distant future. Come the year 2080 Elon Musk will use SpaceX to launch an entirely new business venture, an anti-aging business for the 1% where wealthy individuals will pay to board a rocket that will orbit the sun closely for four months so that their internal clocks will be retarded. Even in the vast stretches of the universe the laws of capitalism and vanity apply. Because of this I have chosen to invest once a month in Tesla stocks for I wish to hang around the sun a few decades from now so that my skin may be smooth as a crystalline lake. By investing I can ensure Elon has enough money to launch this business in 2080, and I will have made enough from my investments to take the trip.


God bless Elon. God bless the Sun. ",2020-02-13 02:39:10

814,bcuggp,False,None,118,Moon in Cancer Overview,astrology,"Moon is in domicile in Cancer. This means that, since Moon is the natural ruler of Cancer, it feels at home with this sign.¬†Moon represents emotions, the inner self, our personality and needs and well as the feminine energy and the mother.

The reason Moon feels best when in Cancer is because Cancer embodies all the qualities Moon represents: Cancer is caring and emotional, introspective and (usually) family oriented. Cancer Moons are unusually perceptive when it comes to emotions, even more than Cancer Suns. They seem to instinctively know how you feel and what you need and will do their best to take care of your emotional needs. That is unless they are too preoccupied with their own emotions that they have to put you on hold until they sort their problems out. It's not that they don't want to help you, because they do, but their own emotions can at times be so overwhelming that they have to deal with them first.

If, on the other hand, a Cancer Moon native is not dealing with the intense emotions of their own, they are the best confidants you can find. They will listen to you and actually care about what you're saying. If you feel bad, they will feel bad, too (if they like you, of course). They have very warm and soothing energy unless they go into their crabby moods and start sulking. Nevertheless, their sulking behavior is not destructive and they will try to smooth things over as soon as their emotions are stabilized.

If poorly aspected, they are prone to pushing their way, sulking and pouting when things don't go as they wished. They want peace and harmony but on their terms. Luckily, because they do genuinely care about others, if you present them your case from the emotional point of view, they are likely to concede. The key with a Cancer Moon is always emotion. Because they see the world through the lenses of their feelings, they will be sympathetic to your feeling as well.

The biggest problem for anyone with strong Cancer influence, be it Sun, Moon, personal planets or Imum Coeli in combination with two or more of the personal planets/Luminaries, is the insecurity. That‚Äôs the main issue all the other issues stem from. Because Cancer is so insecure it very often results in all of the selfish and manipulative behavior. Let me be clear here - Cancers are not manipulative because they want to or because of some devious reasons. No. Cancers are manipulative because they don‚Äôt feel safe. If a Cancer would feel safe, all of this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.

Moon in Cancer people are avid of love and acceptance. It‚Äôs not only that they want to receive love, but they also want to give love‚Ä¶ big time. They are very perceptive of other people‚Äôs emotions but because of the insecurities we mentioned before, a Cancer Moon person also tends to read into things that are not there, like taking a slight from a simple, misinterpreted look.

Depending on the rest of the chart, If the Cancer Moon native doesn't get the attention they need, they might seek it through passive-aggression. They will not be doing it on purpose or even be aware that they are doing it, but if they feel that the other person is not giving them the amount of attention they feel they deserve, they may either attack the other person (verbally) or sulk and pout until that other person does what they want.

Nevertheless, when they do care about you, they are capable of moving mountains for you. Because they are so intuned with your feelings, they will do important things for you that you haven‚Äôt even asked them to. They will take care of you and your emotional needs as long as you show them enough attention and love and, for them, it‚Äôs almost never enough.

If you find yourself in any kind of trouble, rest assured that these people will make their own personal mission to help you out, no matter what. Remember that video of a crab (animal) helping out his crab friend? Cancer Moon natives are like that - they might not know how to help themselves, but they will risk everything to help you if they truly care for you.

but i feel like the coronavirus has some Saturn energy tied to it because of the vengeful nature that it has. because saturn is known for being karmic etc etc and for repaying what people give out. i‚Äôm not saying all the patients got it because of karma, what i‚Äôm saying is that the biggest stories that surface about the virus and the groups involved tend to have some sort of lesson to be learned from it.

for example, in singapore, there was some christian church group who talked mad shit about the coronavirus being some sort of ‚Äúdivine retribution‚Äù like a punishment from God because of the growing LGBTQ+ support in the country. and IRONICALLY, a while later, the group contracted said virus, and it spread to many members of the church. it was like a talk shit get hit kind of situation.

then, there was a korean christian cult that was rather notorious and they experienced the same thing. where a woman literally refused treatment to spread it to the rest of the cult because she believed that they were the chosen ones to go to heaven or something like that. don‚Äôt quote me lol.

there have been a few more instances of stuff like this that i‚Äôll get into if requested, because it‚Äôs a lot. and very complex too, and i‚Äôm a little too tired to type it all out.

can anyone give any insight into the karmic energy attached to the coronavirus? according to the timeline i think also the virus might have been born during Capricorn season, which is ruled by Saturn.

818,eqavyz,False,Horoscope,23,Aquarius Season 2020/ The Art of Detachment #AstroWitch,astrology," 
On Monday January 20th, 2020 the sun makes its way into Aquarius. The sun is detrimental in Aquarius and gets burned easily. It doesn‚Äôt want the light shined only on itself, rather it‚Äôs light shined on its knowledge. In astrology we call Aquarius the mature one of the air signs and it‚Äôs key phrase is ‚ÄúI Know!‚Äù Aquarius in the chart represents friendships, organizations and inspiration. Are your friends inspiring you to be your best self? 

Aquarius energy can often come off as detached. This is due to their wisdom of being an individual while also being apart of the collective. Aquarius season asks us to detach from our personal feelings and connect to the ALL! The Art of Detachment is NOT running away or fading to black. The practice of detachment is the ability to be fully present in any situation while detaching from the pain and sadness coming from individuals. I compare this to those who work in emergency care, they are focused on solutions and healings all the while screaming and pain is all around them. They do not run and hide, yet detach bc they KNOW you are in pain and are finding solutions to the problem. Chaos is always around us, chaos does not have to be within us. 
 
This zodiac adapts and gets to the solution using its knowledge. The new moon in Aquarius on January 24th will give us the a fresh start with our emotions and feelings. This opportunity will allow us to let go of the idea that something is happening to us and flow into the feelings of I‚Äôm happening to something. Neptune and Venus are both in intuitive Pisces, heightening our psychic abilities and also showing us victim personality that may be attracting the situations we profess we do not like. Dream big, attract big. 
 
The Full moon on February 9th, in Leo is an heartfelt moment to tap into your inner child. Is she still there waiting for something? Go within and speak the words and give the comfort to your inner child, bring her to the present. Give her the apologies and forgiveness she deserves to move forward. 
 
Saturn in its comfy spot of Capricorn has a few more weeks before it makes its leap to rebellious and unique Aquarius. Spend these moments checking off your to-do list, setting up healthy boundaries and structuring your goals. 

In tarot the Fool card is governed by Uranus while Aquarius is governed by The Star card. Both cards remind us this is all apart of the journey. While these days ‚Äúfool‚Äù is used in negative context, in tarot the fool is free. The fool does not care what the masses perceive and goes foolishly on its journey knowing all is right and exact.

They found that 40% of the members in the study had their Sun in Pisces, while the majority of the remaining 60% had their Sun in either Scorpio, Cancer, or Capricorn.

They also found that only 8 members in the study, past and present, had their Sun in an air sign.

What‚Äôs with all the water? The thing that REALLY surprised me was the large percentage of Pisces.

It‚Äôs been complete hell for me and mostly I everyone I know. 

WHY?? üò≠

Scorpio ‚òÄÔ∏è Aries üåô Capricorn üåÖ",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/d75atw/is_virgo_season_over_yet/,111,"Jupiter and Neptune have been having a series of squares over the past few months. The previous Jupiter-Neptune squares were on Jan. 13, 2019 and June 16, 2019, and the final pass, a couple of days ago with Jupiter now pulling away. These squares are probably more intense for people with something at 14-18 degrees of Pisces or Sagittarius (and by the same token, Virgo and Gemini, the axial mutables) but can also be activated by midpoints and also parallel and contra-parallels as well as other contacts that may not be as readily obvious as the traditional Ptolemaic aspects (square, trine, etc). 

There is also the impending Saturn/Pluto conjunction coming up in January 2020, the effects of which are probably starting to build up now. Outer planet transits take a LONG time. They build and are perhaps subtle at first but they continue to build and then once the aspect has reached partile, it seems to ease fairly quickly but then we are left to deal with the fallout. 

Some may feel Virgo season was very tough and I see comments about mental health issues... Neptune would be indicated here, Jupiter expands and enlarges whatever he touches. It all relates personally to the position and integration in the individual's chart as to what extent and precisely how it manifests. There was connections going deeper with the outers who were in a position of a lot of contacts whilst sun was transitting Virgo. So this only serves to intensify where in a Virgo month that did not have any substantial contacts with outers, Jupiter in a different sign just for one instead of a mutable, the effects would be more subtle. Virgo time is about finding our service and devotion. That is the best way to cope with adverse effects, especially with Neptunean involvement as it dissolves structures. Reality may have felt surreal as Jupiter and Neptune made contact for the last time this series. 

In my professional opinion, it is more the outer planet activity which had become partile (there is also Saturn stationing direct) and sun in Virgo was a very small part of it but like a window through which light shone onto what the outer contacts were facilitating. More of a frame to see the whole picture, and the tension could be quite uncomfortable for a lot of people. Of course with the knowledge that Virgo and Gemini (both Mercurial signs ruled by Mercury) have a natural tendency towards anxiety to begin with. ",2019-09-21 03:14:23
848,b9gzr3,False,None,113,Moon in Aries Overview,astrology,"When people think of Aries, the first thing that comes to mind is a high-intensity warrior who goes after what he wants without taking obstacles into account. They are goal oriented people with an instant gratification streak.
 
This is mostly true for the Sun in Aries people (mostly, because one‚Äôs chart is not composed only of their Sun sign), and even though it‚Äôs also true for Moon in Aries natives, it‚Äôs very different from the Aries Suns.

The greatest difference between a Sun sign and a Moon sign is that Sun is overt and Moon is covert. What I mean by this is that that you should see Sun as the character and Moon as a personality. Sun is seen by everyone (who get to know you a little bit, that is, because otherwise, the first thing people see when they meet you is your Ascendant), and Moon is seen best only by the people who know you well. Some people exude their Moon Sign characteristics more acutely than their Sun Sign but generally, this is the rule of thumb.

If we translate this to the Aries Sun/Moon, it goes like this: Aries Sun will be outwardly active if a little aggressive and pushy. Aries Moon will be like that on the inside while they may present a different exterior to the world (unless they also have Sun in Aries).

Moon in Aries people feel the intensity and impetuousness of the Aries on a much deeper level. They may not behave like an Aries, but they will certainly feel like one. Their emotions will be constantly in turmoil as they feel acutely about everything around them. Nothing is lukewarm with them. In that sense, there is a similarity with the Moon in Scorpio but unlike this Moon, Aries intensity is more positive and brighter. Though they get upset easily, they don‚Äôt tend to brood and ruminate like the Scorpio Moon. They get upset, go through that emotion with both intensity and velocity and once it passes, they forget about it. That the good thing ‚Äì Aries Moon natives don‚Äôt hold grudges and they generally forget things as easily as they get upset by them. It‚Äôs all flowing naturally and fast for them ‚Äì they are the fire that initiates (Aries is a cardinal sign) but doesn‚Äôt burn too long.

On the other hand, it‚Äôs not easy to have an Aries Moon. Because the Moon represents the inner Self and the emotions, taking things too intensely on a daily basis can be overwhelming. That‚Äôs why it would do good for an Aries Moon to do some sports, to vent out all those intense emotions they are having inside. They usually do have the inclination to do sports or do some other physical activity that will match the intensity inside. Even if they are not playing any kind of sports, you‚Äôll usually find them walking briskly and/or leading a fast-paced life.
 
Aries Moon is action driven and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs difficult for them to stay passive. Even if the life circumstances require them to lead a more passive life they won‚Äôt definitely be happy about it. They‚Äôll feel like a tiger trapped in a cage. Regardless of the rest of the chart, once they feel cornered they will explode in a frightful manner.

How strong the Aries Moon will manifest itself for the native and if there will be any issues, depends on the rest of the chart. Still, when we compare Luminaries (Sun and Moon signs) there are some Sun signs that can tolerate Aries Moon better and some that won‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs find out which Sun/Moon combination is smoother for the native and which one is more explosive.

850,a2k2mg,False,None,104,Do you relate to the appearance descriptions of your Rising sign?,astrology,"**ARIES:** Tend to have sharp and distinctive features and prominent brows. Aries rules the head and face, and some may have birthmarks, scars, etc. on the face or head. Males may tend toward baldness -- all that testosterone, perhaps? Strong bone structure, quick movements, and an upright posture are associated with this sign. Some of this sign have a ruddy complexion; all will tend to have a strong constitution. They may tend to glance around the room, as opposed to maintaining a steady gaze, and tend to have a confident, brisk manner of walking.

**TAURUS:** Frequently large bodied (not necessarily plump or fat), but could also be muscular and sturdy. Dark hair and eyes ‚Äì remember, eyes could also be dark blue and hair dark blond as well as brown or black, with a serene and steady gaze. Interestingly, members of this sign often have smaller-than-expected ears. Their hair tends toward naturally curly or wavy. Ruling the throat and neck, this bodily area is often eye-catching -- maybe a thick, ""bull-like"" neck, or perhaps a long, graceful one, but generally prominent in some way.

**GEMINI:** Highly expressive faces, reflecting their mood-of-the-moment. These people give off a feeling of energy, even when at rest. They may jitter a bit or shake their legs, but even if they're not actually moving, there's a sense of energy, simply waiting to explode. Often graced with ""small features"" -- it sounds odd, but look at the face, and it may seem somewhat doll-like, with the features more centered than spread out. Fast-paced speech goes along with extremely quick minds. Physically agile with a naturally slim build (although some weight gain is a possibility) they just seem like they ""should"" be tall and thin, even when they're not. Most often pale-complected, with restless eyes that seem to take in everything all at once, they frequently possess high foreheads.

**CANCER:** Their most prominent feature is a round face. Even when skinny they frequently have rounded soft features, and apple cheeks. This sign rules the stomach and breasts, and these are often noticeable in some way. The stomach may be rounded and Santa-like, or flat with six-pack abs; the female's breasts may be large or small, but tend to be well-formed and pleasing to the eye in either case. Rounded eyes tend to give a ""moony"" or ""dreamy"" expression. High cheekbones and a prominent brow compliment the look. Extremely expressive features with long limbs compared to the trunk -- even short natives often have a ""lanky"" look to their arms and legs.

**LEO:** In keeping with their Zodiacal symbol, lions frequently have mane-like hair, framing their keen-eyed, well-shaped faces. They tend toward high color in complexion, sometimes tending to ruddy. These natives will have a regal bearing, erect posture, and graceful movements. Their movements can be slow, but dramatic and extremely ""leonine!"" Eyes tend to be almond shaped, often a dark shade -- again, not necessarily brown or black, but dark blue, dark green, dark hazel. They may have a tendency toward ""bad backs,"" or pain in the back, neck, and sometimes the shoulder area, although the shoulders themselves tend to be strong and broad.

**VIRGO:** Gentle and graceful of movement, as well as a youthful appearance, they tend to seem younger than their years. Some blush easily, though more often because they've been embarrassed by being singled out, rather than from prudishness. While this sign‚Äôs symbol is the Virgin, this doesn't mean they are cold or asexual, but they do tend to be modest. Look for bright, clear eyes with a gentle but direct expression, delicate noses, and well-shaped, curvy lips. They can be obsessed by their own appearance, seeing flaws that no one else does, and they go to lengths to ""hide"" them. You may catch them staring at their own expressions in the mirror, busy analyzing perceived flaws, but only when they think no one's looking. When it comes to the things they can manage about their appearances, Virgo goes to extremes: neat beyond imagination or the consummate slob - both typify this sign‚Äôs nature. Frequently they can look somewhat fragile, but surprise you with their physical strength. Digestive problems, upset stomachs, and outbreaks of nervousness and insecurity are frequent.

**LIBRA:** Truly Venus's children, with well-shaped lips and noses, sometimes heart-shaped or oval faces, dimpled cheeks and cleft chins can be common. Generally, they have well-proportioned features and pleasant expressions, even when they're not in a pleasant mood. Their movements tend to be graceful, and facial features tend to be more rounded than angular. Another characteristic is a clear and mellifluous speaking voice. Even when not conventionally attractive there will be a certain charm to them -- their faces have character, whether they're what would be considered beautiful or not. They are graced with a gorgeous smile and lovely, infectious laughter.

**SCORPIO:** This intense sign is really is all about the eyes. Dark or light, the gaze will be piercing and direct, and unless they're shooting vengeful daggers from them, people will often comment on how beautiful their eyes are. Direct eye contact is this sign's hallmark, they are never ""shifty eyed."" Sharp features, prominent cheekbones and noses, are common, some what similar to that of a bird of prey. These people tend to have strong constitutions, and often powerful-looking physiques. Many are pale-complected (remember, ""paleness"" does not always equate to ""whiteness"") and can maintain the famous poker-face, able to keep their inner emotions from their outward expressions. Ruling the reproductive organs, these natives may be prone to possible health problems in this region of the body. Magnetic and mysterious, sensual and compelling is their natural gift.

**SAGITTARIUS:** ‚ÄúClumsy grace‚Äù is this sign‚Äôs most noticeable physical trait. This may sound contradictory, but it's really not. Think of a newborn foal, teetering and tottering on its legs, while still showing glimpses of the powerful, athletic horse it will one day become. Openness and friendliness show in the Archer's face and posture. You may find these natives may lean forward when conversing with you, getting physically closer to engage emotional closeness. Broad foreheads and cheerful expressions are the norm, as are quick movements and dramatic gestures. They sometimes play with their hair, mostly unconsciously, casually tossing their head to sweep it back, or grabbing a lock and tugging at it. They often have beautiful, clear, sparkling eyes. Naturally, they tend toward a strong, athletic build, but can become plump due to their love of food, drink and (due to their ruler, Jupiter) excesses.

**CAPRICORN:** When talking to a native of this winter sing, you may often be struck by their well-modulated, often deep speaking voices. Frequently they have naturally straight hair, and dark or olive complexions. Lacking the jittery energy of other signs, the Goat will generally make slower, more deliberate movements. When at rest, they'll exhibit steady, somewhat serious expressions. This face will generally sport a straight, well-shaped nose reaching up to seemingly prominent eyebrows exhibiting the ‚ÄúT‚Äù shape this sign is known for. Their skin tends to be sensitive, sometimes subject to rashes, outbreaks, or easy bruising. You notice their teeth -- perhaps because they're straight, white and even or crooked or have many fillings. Graceful in manner, but sometimes because they have difficulty relaxing; this sign may appear uptight, bored, or uncomfortable. Once they get past their discomfort, they will appear fresh and warm.

**AQUARIUS:** One common trait of this sign is a ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù well-defined forehead. Generally soft-spoken and polite, this sign can fly off at a moment's notice into eccentricity. They often have dreamy, light-colored eyes, naturally straight and light-colored hair with finely-chiseled, attractive facial features, and lovely profiles. They're frequently broad through both hips and shoulders -- males and females alike with strong, shapely legs. Members of this sign are very sensitive to weather and barometric pressure, so expect to find them bundled up in the winter and stripped down in hot weather. These people are great listeners and equally known as great story-tellers.

**PISCES:** Gentleness combined with keen intuition that shows in the soft, dreamy round eyes is the keynote of this water sign. Graceful, quick movements that resemble the fish that represents their sign are common. These natives tend to have a quite charming manner and a lovely smile. Ruling the feet, they often have small, delicate feet, or overly large ‚Äúclodhoppers.‚Äù Their hair tends to be soft and fine, sometimes naturally wavy and most often lighter-colored. Their skin is almost always soft and may tend to be pearl-like. Elegant, flowing movements are indicative of this sign and they seem to appear ‚Äúsmall‚Äù for some reason, even the tallest among them. Look for tranquil expression, giving a languid affect along with beautiful smiles, mischievous grins and tinkling laughter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/a2k2mg/do_you_relate_to_the_appearance_descriptions_of/,109,"Link: https://imgur.com/a/mzyn8aP

851,8t79nq,False,None,47,CANCER SEASON SURVIVAL GUIDE,astrology,"Cancer season (June 22-July 23) is wonderful - it marks the beginning of summer, and if navigated correctly, it can be a great period of positive internal change. But it's also known for its emotional messiness and general turmoil, and it can be especially rough for people who lack water placements in their chart. However, I believe that if one uses each season's unique conditions to grow and adapt, they can create a cycle of positivity throughout their entire life! So, using my experience with the zodiac seasons, I will give you some tips on how to turn this messy season into a positive one! 

1. Spend Time With Loved Ones. This season can bring on an onslaught of insecurities, fears, and emotions that you may have never realized you had, and may have trouble understanding. And the instinct for many people (especially air-dominant and mutable-dominant people) may be to isolate themselves until the storm passes, so that no one else has to deal with them. But in excess, isolation can become extremely detrimental! You must remember - everyone around you is experiencing the same energies you are. Yes, it would be less than ideal to call your friend at 1 AM crying; but Cancer season is a time where emotional vulnerability makes strong bonds even stronger, and loved ones can help each other heal. So if you're feeling moody or lonely, consider talking to a friend or loved one. You never know - they may be feeling the exact same way.

2. Get Some Alone Time. I know this directly contradicts the previous tip, but I believe balance is important, especially if you're extroverted and don't often think to give yourself alone time. The emotions that surface this season have a purpose, which is to show you subconscious problems you need to resolve. And in order to solve these problems, you have to spend some time with yourself, looking within. This takes practice, and it's not always pleasant, but it always leads to better self awareness.

3. Remember That Your Expectations Affect Your Reality. During this season, people are especially vulnerable to negative mindsets. But if you walk into a situation believing it will be terrible, it will inevitably be terrible. This applies to everything from running errands to your self image. So, try to catch those pessimistic assumptions early on. Even if it feels like a total lie, keep telling yourself that it's better than you think it is, that it's just the season's energy making you feel that way. And you may be surprised that things aren't half as catastrophic as you think they are! (Of course, it doesn't always work - but it helps retain your sanity.)

4. Be Open to Change. Cancer season is a time of emotional vulnerability, but a lesser known source of the turmoil is Saturn Retrograde, which often occurs at the same time. This is a time where one must learn harsh lessons in order to grow, often causing misfortunes of all kinds, of varying intensities. There are few ways to prepare you for these harsh lessons - except to remember that change has purpose. No matter how bad you feel, you must always remember that this experience is teaching you something valuable, be it strength, honesty, trust, or selflessness. Sometimes, the only way out is through.

I have a firm belief that every season has a purpose in the cycle of internal growth. And Cancer season may be a lot to handle, but it is essential in developing inner clarity and strengthening bonds, and because of that, we would be worse off without it.

856,8z7u5h,False,None,81,"Descendant as the mask you wear to the world, not your Ascendant.",astrology,"Hi all. Hope you‚Äôre well. 

I don‚Äôt want to change anyone‚Äôs mind about the ASC sign and how many, including myself, have come to see it. I only want to add a further interpretation I happened upon. Or maybe for some this isn‚Äôt new at all.

Be that as it may.

I was reading a scholarly article about Evolutionary Astrology, drawing some from the  work of Carl Jung and archetypes. 

The authors proposed something I‚Äôd never considered‚Äîthat your Descendant sign is the mask, persona you take on in the world in order to protect yourself from the perceived vulnerability of your Ascendant.

Before I give an example, their logic was this: your Ascendant sign, and the traits therein, is something that is innate, comes naturally, couldn‚Äôt change it if you tried. But the simplified definition of the Ascendant that we often hear is that it is a persona, but a persona requires *conscious* choice, as the very definition of persona implies you crafted a character on purpose. A mask is something you put on on purpose. So if the Ascendant is inherent and instinctive in a person, there is no choice. Rather, the choice is how we respond to it‚Äî-which is then mirrored in the Descendant. Or the you that you choose to be for other people (which is a 7th house theme). 

The example they gave was of a Scorpio rising. The impulse in that person is to be emotional, intense, to share with others, to be suspicious or volatile. But the Taurus Descendant is how they protect themselves or respond to that emotional intensity. So instead they adopt Taurean traits and give off the impression that others are not needed, that you are solid and NOT emotional or intense, and self sufficient. If Scorpio wants to invest, Taurus is selfish and keeps. And you do that to contain and protect yourself from the intensity of the rising. So you‚Äôd cultivate personality of Taurus‚Äîthat is the persona, the mask.

Does it make sense? 

A Gemini Rising who constantly seeks for knowledge, wants things to be logical, changes their mind, who has breadth not depth of thinking‚Äî-would then adopt the mask of Sagittarius which is concerned with Truth and Wisdom‚Äîdepth. So the Gemini Rising protects themselves from the fact that some things defy logic and that they don‚Äôt know everything by projecting Sagittarius‚Äîthat everything they think is Truth. That they are wise. 

Is it making sense?

Simple one: Cancer ascendent can abhor that it is so instinctually emotional and needing. Then they may project stoic and cold Capricorn to the world in order to protect themselves from the fact that they feel everything so deeply and so often. They may become career oriented like a Capricorn in order to further distract. 

So the Descendant then becomes the way we make up for the perceived weakness of the Ascendant sign. That‚Äôs why we seek for the traits of people with our Descendant sign‚Äîto make up for an imbalance we feel. 

Not only did I find this tremendously eye opening, I also found it healing. Because through knowing this we can confront our shadow side in ourselves and in others. 

They went into mucho more detail than I feel is necessary here. But basically the impetus for this thought is that the sign you have on the Ascendant correlates to the kinds of desires your soul has, and then our separation from Soul-based living (aka feeling separate from others from Universe/God, whatever, because of a society that is ego-based) then creates a crisis we try to make up for by projecting the DC.

I‚Äôm interested to see if anyone sees themselves in this???

So severely, in fact, that last night (and I feel comfortable sharing this here because it won't hinder my purpose or burden anyone in the space/people ""I'm"" currently of use too), I experienced, what I believe to have been my final ego death. The person that was ""me"" is no longer. I grieved; Essentially had a funeral and ""died"" (it sounds cheap now, writing it out, but it was so...incredible in a variety of different ways)...But, I am awake now and feeling better and more comfortable with the ""death""/epiphany (that has, lifelong, sat there, in the back of my mind), and ready to work on what is calling me to service.

863,fdjiq8,False,None,16,"""Love your planets. A well-loved planet is a happy planet"" : Astrology and Nature's 7 Doctors",astrology,"I was looking through some old notes I took during an Astrology University webinar. The lecturer, **Kira Sutherland,** a medical astrologer, was giving pointers about how to maximize your 7 inner planets for health and well-being. It was an interactive webinar and I think either I or someone else asked about Mars in the first house and she said ""take your Mars on a walk! Daily."" Or something to that effect. The point being--these natives need to move and exercise in order to healthfully integrate Mars into their lives. When doing so, you are ""loving"" that planet and loved things behave better. I was remembering this during my martial arts training today and wanted to pass along this information.

From Kira on Naturopathy's 7 Doctors:

*The plan is simple: if you work with these Seven Doctors you will do a lot to improve your health and longevity.*

1. *Sunshine / Get adequate safe amounts (*Sun*)*
2. *Wholefoods / Good nutrition (*Moon*)*
3. *Clean water / Hydration (*Moon*)*
4. *Fresh air / Proper breathing (*Mercury*)*
5. *Exercise / Movement (*Mars*)*
6. *Sleep / Rest (*Venus and Saturn*)*
7. *Mental and emotional well-being (*Jupiter*)*

Here is an example of how Kira suggests feeding the Sun and Moon:

**Sun**

Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Sports, hiking in nature

Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Gardening, walking pets, reading

Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Reading, sitting and socializing

Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Meditation, walking near water, going to the beach

**Moon**

**Aries**  
Adventure, time to yourself and sports. Brain foods such as olive oil, coconut oil, walnuts and iron-rich foods. Make sure you don‚Äôt become dehydrated with all that ‚Äúfire‚Äù. Keep caffeine and alcohol to a minimum.

**Taurus**  
Creating, cooking, music and art. Foods such as salads, fresh fruit, seaweed and prunes. Nothing too heavy or in excess. Opt for hot water and fresh lemon slices and try to limit red wine!

**Gemini**  
Socializing, reading and study. Food for the nervous system, such as raw seeds and nuts, olive oil and whole grains. Carry around a water bottle for hydration as it‚Äôs easy for you to forget to drink.

**Cancer**  
Being near or in the water, emotional expression, writing or journalling and relaxing at home. Foods to strengthen the digestive system, such as bitter greens, warm, hearty soups, stir-fried vegetables and fresh fruits. Herbal teas are great for hydration, as is warm water with fresh lemon slices.

**Leo**  
Using your creativity, playing sport and listening to music. Foods for strength, such as spinach, eggs, beetroot, salads and the broccoli family. Be aware of dehydration; as with all fire signs, you need good amounts of water due to excess heat and sporting endeavours.

**Virgo**  
Routine, feeling useful and productive, mental stimulation. Foods for easy digestion like bitters, lemon, lightly cooked vegetables, fennel and olives. Water is ideally warm, or opt for digestive herbal teas like dandelion or chamomile.

**Libra**  
The arts, socialising and helping others. Include foods like seaweed, fresh salads, berries and celery. Try to restrict sweets. Fluids such as vegetable juices help limit the consumption of alcohol and sweetened drinks while socialising.

**Scorpio**  
Deep conversation, research, time to oneself for reflection. Foods of a cleansing nature, like vegetable juices, citrus and salads, cherries and beetroot. Herbal teas, filtered water and limiting alcohol are vital for you as a water sign.

**Sagittarius**  
New activities, freedom and inspiration. Foods for energy, like oats, greens, seeds, nuts and iron-rich foods. Fresh water in substantial amounts depending on how high your activity and sport levels are.

**Capricorn**  
Being productive, responsible and being a leader. Foods of a warming nature, like soups, stews, root vegetables and leafy greens. Water is best at room temperature, warm in a herbal tea or consumed hot with fresh lemon.

**Aquarius**  
Independence and being original. Foods for grounding and the nerves, such as root veggies, seeds and nuts and good oils. Remember to drink plenty of fluids. Chamomile and lemon balm tea are soothing.

**Pisces**  
Imagination, creativity and connection. Foods of a warming nature, like soups and stir-fried vegetables. It‚Äôs also important not to over eat or drink. As the sign of the fish, you‚Äôll need plenty of water. Remember, alcohol does not count as fluid intake!

&#x200B;

*How do you feed your planets?* For instance, if you have Mercury in Libra in the 3rd: listening to a meditation with gentle music in the background while taking deep breaths would be a great way to reset. Or getting out to take a stroll through the community while breathing fresh air. Similarly, a Mars placed here would maybe enroll in a community exercise class, perhaps something elegant and calming (Libra) like yoga, tai chi, or synchronized swimming! Move Mars to the 10th, and it'll enjoy authoritarian types of exercise, like a boot camp, or a personal trainer who holds you accountable to goals. Move Mars to the 11th and you'll love a large zumba class or even work out at home to YouTube videos. Venus in the 6th or 2nd may place emphasis on a ritualized and materialized night time routines before bed, in order to ensure a deep sleep: lavender linen spray, cozy lighting, a cup of tea. Venus in the 12th may need to meditate before sleeping, or engage in meditation as a form of disengaging and rest. Venus in the 9th may read a Bible verse before bed, or engage spiritually somehow.

Take your placements and plug it into the framework above. Let me know what you come up with/or are already doing.

The day of the exact conjunction bearing down on his Sun in a Capricorn in the 12th house of endings, loss, misfortune.

He actually also said he knew something was wrong on the day of January 12th, when he experienced shortness of breath. 

His solar return for this year had the Saturn Pluto conjunction taking place in his 3rd house. While it may be a stretch to assign the function of breathing to the 3rd house, lung capacity and the actual mechanics behind talking goes hand in hand with being able to consistently communicate and verbalize ideas over a broadcast radio show. He said he will have to be off air and miss some shows in order to receive treatment. Chiron is also in his solar return 6th.

His solar return Moon in Leo is conjunct his MC. That he had to come out and make an emotional revelation that will affect his career is in direct opposition to his Aquarian sensibilities ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like making things about me,‚Äù he said in the release.

888,9u8xcu,False,None,31,Notes on the New Moon in Scorpio and what it could mean for you.,astrology,"**11/7/2018.**

Happening at 15 degrees of Scorpio, this New Moon lands right in the middle of the Sun‚Äôs annual dip into the scorpion‚Äôs sign, pulling us all, if only for a moment, into the undercurrents of our lives. For some, this may feel like drowning. For others, a momentary swim into the deep end of the pool, treading water, affirming that you must stay afloat. Either way, it is Scorpio‚Äôs demand that we move away from the shallow end, where sign posts warn: *no diving*. But dive we must. And safer in the depth that Scorpio contains than to bump your head up against the shallows of your life, the things that don‚Äôt budge, the patterns that don‚Äôt work. Such is the pain of a life unexamined. And so the Sun and Moon join, like buddy detectives, to give us a chance to dig into those things that dig into us, cast away the thorny bits, and intend to begin again with a new sense of profundity about ourselves. Scorpio‚Äôs briny waters can irritate wounds, but so can they locate and force us to acknowledge them, to heal them. And what once were wounds become places where light can enter. 

*You‚Äôre lost at sea, then I‚Äôll command your boat to me again.*

The New Moon will be trining Neptune at 13 degrees of Pisces, acting as a sort of light house, a star in the distance that we can hitch our wagons to. Neptune is a healing salve here, reminding us of universal love and compassion, the tools we need to come into acceptance of ourselves, our stories and of others. The command is to let wishful thinking become wishful *knowing*, a conviction that all that is tended to here, the dark and ugly, can be transmuted into something bigger and more beautiful that can serve the unfolding of your life. This is the alchemy of Neptunian water--base metals, rough and penetrating (Scorpio) can become smoothed into gold. But with Mercury squaring Neptune from 8 degrees of Sagittarius, this dreaminess can easily become a dream, the delusions that fuel our demons, and the fantasies that keep us from attending to what is. By all means, see life through a softer lens. Just don‚Äôt layer the filters up so high that you lose track of what is real. Go forth practicing your *practical* magic.

*Catch a wave and take in the sweetness.*

Mars in Aquarius, ruler of this New Moon, will be squaring ever-expansive and hopeful Jupiter, now in his final stretch at 29 degrees of Scorpio. Mars catalyzes what it touches, and with Jupiter in the picture, this is the galvanization of optimism, courage and enthusiasm. (And oh what is to come when Jupiter returns home the following day!). The great benefic has been traveling the murky waters of Scorpio since 2017, ensuring an ultimate warmth and camaraderie around matters hidden or held deeply entrenched. Let Jupiter be a beacon of hope, the inflation into a depleted life jacket. Any turbulent time can be reframed by asking and considering what there is to be learned. Wisdom is also a gift of Jupiter‚Äîknowing better, doing better, feeling better. In the middle of whatever bad may be happening, no matter how tempting it may be to let yourself be overcome with overwhelm, a gaseous and gregarious Jupiter rides the waves, always afloat, reminding us: this, too, can be good.

*The darkness, the deepness, all the things that make me who I am.*

A sextile from the New Moon to Pluto at 19 degrees of Capricorn may feel like a rip tide. Just when you thought you‚Äôd gone deep enough, here Pluto comes to pull you deeper. Sextiles operate a bit softer, but nothing is ever subtle with Pluto around. While this won‚Äôt capsize you, it will demand you batten down your emotional hatches. Pluto in Capricorn breaks down structures that are not strong enough to weather storms, and Moon in Scorpio, its detriment, can be sensitive to the Plutonian intensity. The call here is for personal power and resurgence. The waters that threaten to drown you can become the tears called forth for catharsis, and the sweat from battles never conceded. In the end, all can be transcended. The symbiosis of a sextile is between two elements that feed one another. Here, water feeds earth, and earth grounds water. Whether you feel you‚Äôre at rock bottom, or just between a rock and a hard place, learn to soften it by leaning into your emotions this New Moon, knowing that the Pluto promise is that they will soon be transformed into new life and seen in a new light.

Oh, you thought we were done talking about Venus Retrograde? Though not the ruler of this lunation like she was for our prior two, Venus is still very much around and worth a quick mention. On this New Moon, Venus will be opposite a newly regressed retrograde Uranus in Aries from 26 degrees of Libra. Matters of love reign, literally. Venus in Libra is dignified, out from soupy Scorpio and ascended back to her throne. This is a lighter Venus as retrograde themes come to an end. Uranus is still the shock factor, so always expect the unexpected, and here, in your relationships. But leave room in your heart for the pleasant surprises as well. This retrograde season isn‚Äôt going to end as darkly as it may have begun, and that alone is surprise enough for those beaten and battered. Uranus may threaten the Libran balance Venus strives for, but balance can always be achieved when you consider what deserves to be on your scales.

*Don‚Äôt look too far, right where you are, that‚Äôs where I am.*

New Moons are primo times for setting intentions or writing down goals. But in the dark waters of Scorpio, and hidden in the night sky, leaving behind a palpable absence, this inky New Moon may instead be a great opportunity to just be still in whatever currents are within you. Knowing bright new horizons are on the way and that the cosmic dance of planets in and out of signs, backwards and forward, will soon dazzle us all, is even more of an invitation to just be. The gift of this New Moon doesn‚Äôt have to be future-oriented, something you‚Äôll later get or seize or understand. Rather, it can be something to be enjoyed in the present. For Scorpio, the depth of discomfort you hold now, then becomes the depth of joy you can hold later. So hold on.

892,8xqk7w,False,None,53,Jupiter is Direct Y'all. Let The Church Say AMEN!,astrology,"I'm interested in how Jupiter's retrograde worked out for you all. What did you learn, how did you grow, what did you acquire? And how will you use it to know go forth?

Jupiter RX'd in my 6th whole sign house, and stomped the breaks on my day jorb and to a lesser degree, my health. A raise I was promised was halted. I felt very stuck in my job and was considering all these radical (and nonsensical) ways to leave. My daily routines were becoming boring and borderline depressing and out of step. I hit a plateau in my fitness journey. I had health ""scares"" (mostly hypochondria), and my mental health plummeted. I had to take a break from my tarot readings. Money flow was TIGHT. SO TIGHT.

And because Jupiter was in Scorpio, I fell down a rabbit hole of examining everything to death, piecing together deeper meanings. It was a rich, introspective time that spawned from a lot of external turmoil.

Mostly what I learned was confidence in self and what I can offer to the world. I also learned not to rush things, as Jupiter RX makes luck and blessings seem THAT much more out of reach, and I was rushing around trying to create them for myself.

During the last few days and certainly today, I don't feel blocked anymore. I've been optimistically throwing my resume around, pitching myself for projects, creating random content and ideas. Most surprisingly (and a lil coz of Uranus), I got a lightening strike idea for a business I want to start, and am receiving help and guidance there.

Coincidentally, today I am finally seeing a new doctor (6th house!)--one who has compassion and bed-side manner through the roof. I've been seeing a really stoic, cold and clinical doctor for years who just throws pills and unhelpful advice at me, and today I am cherishing the chance to be seen by someone who actually cares. Thanks Jupiter!

I'm feeling very hopeful now, and in the midst of some upcoming eclipses on my Sun and money houses, the addition of Jupiter direct makes me feel like a turning point is truly on the way, and gives me an extra boost of joyful anticipation. A grand trine this week too.

893,g0s0m9,False,None,96,"why outer planets don't make good sign rulers, and why 1st house does not equal aries, 2nd house does not equal taurus, etc.",astrology,"So, being a part of the astrological community - and working professionally as a traditional astrologer - when I talk about rulerships or houses, there is no doubt that someone will quickly reply with ""But you're wrong. uranus rules aquarius!"" or referring to things as ""Scorpio/the 8th house is about... \_\_\_"" 

   this is a super touchy subject, and people tend to get a bit upset when told that as a solar pisces they are actually jupiter ruled and not neptune ruled, etc. 

Things get taken personally, feelings get hurt, resentments get built, and its just not productive at all, and both the traditional rulership person and modern rulership person walk away feeling worse than they did before.  So I thought I would make a post talking about WHY traditional astrologers use the rulerships and house associations they use.

   So first of all, the reason why traditional astrologers still do not use outer planets (Uranus Neptune Pluto) as rulers is NOT because they don't ""believe in"" or use these planets.

  First of all, in traditional astrology, we classify the relationship between a sign and a planet using what is known as essential dignities & debilities. In traditional astrology, there are not just rulerships, but several different types of relationships that a planet and a sign can have.  For the sake of simplicity here, we will focus on rulerships, but here is a table explaining the traditional dignities and debilities. [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/dig2.html](http://www.skyscript.co.uk/dig2.html)

So, I will say that when the outer planets are used, Uranus does find its dignity in Aquarius, Neptune in Pisces, and Pluto in Scorpio, (they also have signs in which they are exalted, in fall, in detriment too) so there is a relationship between Scorpio, Pisces, Aquarius and the outer planets! But, the outer planets do not RULE these signs, or any signs at all, and there is a reason. The reason is that if we take Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, and use them as the rulers of signs, it messes up the complex system of dignities and debilities.  

   Here is one reason: with the exception of the luminaries (the Sun = Leo and Moon = Cancer) each of the other 5 planets rule 2 zodiac signs - we have: 

Mercury - Gemini & Virgo,

 Venus - Taurus & Libra, 

Mars - Aries & Scorpio, 

Jupiter - Sagittarius & Pisces,

 Saturn - Capricorn & Aquarius. 

   thus, if we add in the outer planets of uranus, neptune, and pluto as rulers, knowing they are not luminaries who can get away with ruling 1 sign - we would have to assign the 3 outer planets 2 signs each. No one has been able to figure out a way to do this that actually makes sense. 

Now onto the houses: in traditional astrology - 

  the 12 houses being ruled as 1H = aries, 2h= taurus is a baseless modern disambiguation. there are 0 source texts that define the houses this way. 

certain planets have what is called a ""joy"" in certain houses -and that is the closest we come to houses being consistently associated with signs or planets. Here is a great paper by astrologer Chris Brennan that talks about the joys, and the themes of all the houses. [http://www.hellenisticastrology.com/the-planetary-joys.pdf](http://www.hellenisticastrology.com/the-planetary-joys.pdf)

The joys are as follows:

Mercury's joy is in the 1st house, the Moon's joy is in the 3rd house, Venus' joy is in the 5th house, Mars' joy is in the 6th house, the Sun's joy is in the 9th house, Jupiter's joy is in the 11th, and Saturn's joy is in the 12th house. 

the other houses that do not have a joy just do not have a planetary joy - no planet necessarily ""rejoices"" in houses 2, 4, 7, 8, and 10. 

No one knows exactly where the ""1st house = aries, 2nd house = taurus, 3rd house = gemini"" idea really took root. My theory is that it seemed easy, there were 12 houses and 12 signs so - why not line them up? Its a totally modern creation heavily utilized within pop astrology as a way to simply break down the houses. But technically, it is inaccurate, with no basis in any astrological source texts. 

   And if you want to say that the source texts of astrology make no sense, and are old and dusty and nonsensical and our modern intuition has rendered these ideas archaic and inane? Maybe read a few traditional astrology texts first. Sometimes the wording or spelling can be a little....huh? at first, but I have found so so much more value in these texts than on tumblr blogs or instagram. (not that i don't have some favorite IG & tumblr astrologers!)

   It is simple to do the houses this way, and shit, it was my introductory idea about the houses too. But as I read charts, I began to find that it didn't make too much sense. Why do we need two different things that both mean the same thing as Aries? As well as this, this idea about the houses and about the outer planets as rulers have caused people to begin to mishmash the house meanings, sign meaning, and planet meanings together, losing the distinct value and original ideas about each separate concept. A great book to read on this is called ""The Houses: Temples of the Sky"" by Deborah Houlding. (I had a free pdf version but can't find it. 

Now, Houses do still have rulers, but it changes depending on the orientation of the houses in each natal chart. Whatever your first house is, the ruler of that sign is the ruler of your 1st house, and then the ruler of your 2nd house sign is that ruler of that house, and so on. (ex/ Cancer ascendant = 1st house ruler = moon, 2nd house is leo, ruler = sun, 3rd house is virgo, ruler = mercury, and so on. PS. I prefer the oldest house system, whole signs, over the popular Placidus, but that's a story for another time, or for the comments or something. )

 Another distinction to make is that the outer planets move soooo slowly that the sign they are in makes 0 personal or individual distinctions about the querent themselves. (Uranus takes 7 years to move through one sign, sometimes longer. Neptune takes about 14 years, Pluto takes anywhere between 14 and 30 years. So, if anything, when talking about something like ""Uranus in Capricorn"" we should look at it as the ""Uranus in Capricorn generation."" Similarly, aspects between two outer planets, like Neptune conjunct Uranus, Neptune sextile Pluto, etc., do not have personal significance. 

Things that WILL make an outer planet notable within an individual personality are: 

1) an outer planet closely conjunct the chart angles (AC or DC, IC or MC). Just being in the angular houses (1, 4, 7, or 10) does not have nearly as much significance as when they are actually closely conjunct one of these 4 axis points. 

2) An outer planet involved in a MAJOR aspect (conjunct, square, trine, opposite, sextile) to an inner planet (It also has to be within orb. Neptune being 8-10 degrees away from the Sun/Moon etc. is not a conjunction, or being 7-10 degrees away from an exact square/trine to the Sun/Moon etc. is not a relevant square/trine, whatever, either.)  

I just wanted to put some distinct information out here on why traditional astrologers say the things they do about rulerships and houses. If this is strongly worded, I apologize, I just want to clear things up a bit. 

   If anyone else has anything to add: put it below! And please, let's keep it civil. All astrologers, amateur, professional, modern, traditional, uranian, etc., are extremely bright and valuable!

TLDR; the outer planets don't rule inner planets because all inner planets (other than the luminaries, aka sun/moon) rule 2 different signs, so if we add the outer planets in, it muddles everything.

The houses being lined up with the signs i.e. aries = 1H, taurus = 2H - is a modern creation of convenience. The rulers of houses change depending on your chart (if your ascendant/1H is taurus, the ruler of 1H = venus, 2h=mercury, and so on.)

Edit : I am not suggesting we get rid of the outer planets, I love the outer planets personally. I'm just explaining this logic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/g0s0m9/why_outer_planets_dont_make_good_sign_rulers_and/,100,"I am personally gravitated toward true sidereal astrology which includes Ophiuchus and uses the actual sizes of the constellations. The way I understand houses (I'm a beginner so this is more of a question than a statement) is that the first house begins at the ascendant and moves counterclockwise in equal 30 degree division (about the ecliptic). Is that right? If Midheaven is lower in the sky, does that mean the house divisions appear unequal in a chart (since the houses are divided with respect to the ecliptic coordinate system)?

I found that the inequality of the constellations is hedged by the equal divisions of the houses. I have a lot still to learn about interpreting the houses but my immediate understanding is that they represent ""stages"" of life that are very personal to the subject since it completely depends on the location and time of day they were born.

Not sure how your post applies to true sidereal astrology but I would like to learn more! ",2020-04-13 21:26:18

I've done a little research. Here's a few examples:  
(apologizing in advance for any typos, I'm a native Portuguese speaker so my English is kinda broken)

**1- Jenny Slate**[Jenny Slate comedy bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUlocCSm4ns)

*March 25, 1982 at 11:19 AM at Milton, Massachusetts, United States*

Jenny is a sensitive, vulnerable, pure and optimistic type of comedian. Her text is flirty and has a lot of energy. She's a metaphorical speaker focusing on her inner life (feelings and perceptions) to build her comedy material. (""I feel like a turtle that just got roller skates and realized that things can be fast."").

**Jenny's interesting aspects:**\- Sun trine Uranus - it's common amongst skilled storytellers. She's also a poet.- Mercury conjunct MC - I think these people tend to be straightforward and rather precocious when it comes to communication and I think this aspect itself shows us someone thriving through storytelling as a career.

**2- Sarah Silverman**[Sarah Silverman comedy bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPzDqCE7Lc4)

*December 1, 1970 at 6:30 AM at Bedford, New Hampshire, United States*

A very sexual, dry type of comedy. She's outspoken, she curses a lot, she's very sarcastic... she does a lot of dirty jokes (which definitely didn't make it to SNL...)

**Sarah's interesting aspects:**\- A Sag sun with Sag rising and Mercury in Sag. There's a loooot of fire going on.- Mercury square MC: Sarah's a real mouthful with a restless brain, the ""I might get in trouble because I talk too much"" type. Her mind is bubbling 24/7, there's always something going on. Might come as a little self-centered sometimes, communication-wise.

**3 - Donald Glover**[Donald Glover comedy bit](https://youtu.be/xs_zLnXsZH4)

*September 25, 1983 at 5:56 AM at Bakersfield, California, United States*

He's a jack of all trades and a master of all of them. This guy was still living at his NYU dorm while writing Emmy-winning episodes of 30 Rock. He sings, he raps, he does stand-up, he's hot, he does everything. There used to be an outsider aura to his early stand-up works, in which he puts himself as a geeky guy, but as he grows older his material earns layers and layers and becomes dense, and so does his art and personal aesthetics...

**Donald's interesting aspects:**\- Virgo rising gives me some of the geeky vibes in his early comedy days. Ya know, the fast-paced speeches (Mercury culture...), the pop culture references...- Mars trine Neptune, Venus in Libra: I think both of these aspects say lots about his music and his suave persona. When you compare his early works to his [SNL monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C23p96MI88&t=182s), you find it difficult to believe we're talking about the same person.

These techs starting from the 5G will start a cascade of tech implementation that can possibly lead to an easy implementation of global control and surveillance. Besides the 5G possibly affecting the Schumann Resonance and the Neuralink with a high risk of mind control, I see this as a violation of our ability to access the divine.

If shit hits the fan (again, disclaimer, maybe paranoid) we should be ready for this. How will we communicate, how will we act resistance, how will we live in resistance? How will we win?

923,a83nj6,False,None,79,Saturn is about to move in to 10¬∞ alignment with Pluto...,astrology,"... and financial markets have seen the worst December decline since the Great Depression, protests are on the rise in Europe, and tensions are growing between China and North America.

In chapter 5 of his book *Cosmos and Psyche*, Richard Tarnas describes Saturn/Pluto periods as

""... especially challenging historical periods marked by a pervasive quality of intense *contraction:* eras of international crisis and conflict, empowerment of reactionary forces and totalitarian impulses, organized violence and oppression, all sometimes marked by lasting traumatic effects. An atmosphere of gravity and tension tended to accompany these three-to-four-year periods, as did a widespread sense of epochal closure: ‚Äúthe end of an era,‚Äù ‚Äúthe end of innocence,‚Äù the destruction of an earlier mode of life that in retrospect may seem to have been marked by widespread indulgence, decadence, na√Øvet√©, denial, and inflation.""

The First World War, Second World War, 9/11, First Crusade, founding of the Ku Klux Klan, and the rise of fascism/totalitarianism in Europe in the 20's (Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler) are just a handful of the examples Tarnas gives of this archetypal complex manifesting in history... Yikes.

Obviously the first thing that comes mind when thinking of present-day manifestations is the Trump phenomenon, along with the growing polarisation in geopolitics marked by strong nationalistic and anti-globalisation/anti-immigration tendencies. Since Trump has taken office astrologers have all been quick to point out that the apex of this Saturn/Pluto cycle is falling directly opposite of his natal Saturn.

I'm also interested in whether all this debacle around finance keeps up much longer, especially given that we're still at the tail end of the Uranus/Pluto square (remember, the 2008 crash happened during a Saturn/Uranus/Pluto alignment). Once this Saturn/Pluto conjunction really starts cooking Uranus will finally move in to Taurus, which brings financial matters even more in to the equation. I'm starting to wonder whether grandmaster Saturn intends on inspecting the stability of the global capitalist order....

Personally, I will be bracing myself, as this sucker is lighting me up. I would advise everyone else to check whether 22¬∞ Capricorn is a sensitive part of your chart, and prepare accordingly :P

925,etff8e,False,None,8,Good beginner book for learning about transits,astrology,"Here's a good start for beginners on understanding transits. Understand it is beginner, meaning lots of descriptions are simplified, and so, one has to go beyond this book for further and deeper understanding of the transiting planets and their impacts. But it is an excellent place to start.

[Astrological Transits, by April Elliott Kent](https://www.bigskyastrology.com/astrological-transits/)

[Table of Contents](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479718451875938304/670349632567640064/unknown.png)

For each transiting planet in a sign she gives a guide at the end of that description. And i want to explain a bit about that. [Here's a screenshot.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479718451875938304/670349664540688384/SNAGHTML6e30f34.png)

She uses, as shown in the red box, 3 guides of interpretation. What she's doing is saying that when  transiting jupiter is in capricorn (just in this example), then if you have planets in the listed signs, here's what that may be like. So... these will always be specific to the transited sign that's being described......

""Biggest rewards"": these will be the *natal* signs that are conjunct or trine by the transiting planet.

""Pressure to take risks"": these are the *natal* signs that will be squared or opposed by the transiting planet.

""Significant opportunities"": these are the *natal*  signs that will be sextiled by the transiting planet.

As a companion, i highly recommend you find a copy of Robert Hand's book Planets In Transit, which describes in much more detail, every transiting planet in each sign, in each house, and in each aspect to each natal planet (major aspects, no minors). But his book is just that, the descriptions of the transits. Kent's will help you understand how transits work, so i'd start with hers.

926,dsaisa,False,None,23,An Oft Ignored Side-Effect of Neptune in Pisces: Binge Watching Television,astrology,"I read a lot about this Neptune in Pisces transit as it relates to the rise of spirituality, astrology, activism, legalizing weed, human rights advances and diverse celebration of the arts. And even sad things like the opioid crisis, especially when Chiron was co-present in Pisces.

I don‚Äôt know how I arrived at this thought but it felt apt to include that the rise of binge watching television and just a general surge of fantastic content is also due to Neptune in Pisces. 

A few months after Neptune entered Pisces, Orange Is The New Black premiered on Netflix as the first show to release *all* episodes at once. It was the start of binge-watching television.

Neptune in Pisces of course enhances the arts. But Neptune as an archetype is also the principle of numbing and disassociating. Binge watching television is a socially accepted form of checking out of life, and in Pisces, checking out of life by indulging in the arts. the word ‚Äúbinge‚Äù itself is often associated with consumption disorders, either food or alcohol. 

Whether you see it as good or bad, it can definitely be attributed to the Neptune in Pisces transit. This era has also saw the rise of streaming platforms like Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, etc., and network television apps that offer what Netflix set out with OITNB. Also‚Äîthe rise of the internet and YouTube influencer. 

Now even Facebook has original tv shows. 

We are drowning in content, in things to watch in order to numb, to retreat, to enjoy, to...whatever.

928,9runz7,False,None,41,Famous People‚Äôs Astrocartography Lines,astrology,"I‚Äôve compiled a little list of examples of astrocartography maps of various famous people, including celebrities, presidents, and political figures.

Hopefully this will give my fellow astrocartography geeks some insight!

Okay let‚Äôs start:

- Kim Kardashian has a Uranus line running right through Paris, which indicates sudden and unexpected events. Paris is also close to her Mars and Pluto lines, which can indicate hardship and near-death experiences. This resulted in her getting robbed at gunpoint in a Parisian hotel. Kim also has a Jupiter line close to her hometown, LA, where she‚Äôs had massive success as a celebrity

- Harry Truman‚Äôs Pluto line runs directly through Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, where he decided to drop the atomic bombs in WW2

- George Bush has a Mars line in Afghanistan, which he decided to invade

- Donald Trump has Mars lines near Washington DC, North Korea, the South China Sea, and the Russian border near Poland, which is more ‚Äútrouble spots‚Äù than any other president in history (very scary if you ask me)

- Yoko Ono has a Venus line running through Liverpool, where John Lennon was born, and John has a Venus line near Tokyo, where Yoko was born

- Bill Clinton‚Äôs Venus line runs through Chicago, where Hillary Clinton was born

- Ellen Degeneres has a Venus line in Horsham, Australia, where Portia de Rossi was born

- JFK‚Äôs Pluto line runs directly through Dallas, where he was assassinated

- Arnold Schwarzenegger has Venus and Jupiter lines (which indicate popularity and success) near Sacramento, where he became Governor

And something I just found out today that makes so much sense:

- Azealia Banks was born and currently lives in NYC, which is right between her Mars and Saturn lines. This makes the region like a battleground for her, which explains her outspoken and aggressive manner towards society, which in turn retaliates and fuels the fire. This makes life in general more difficult and oppressive for her. That being said, I‚Äôm one of her biggest fans, so STREAM ANNA WINTOUR ON SPOTIFY!!!!!

931,fd0jfo,False,None,47,Let's look at whether it is possible to create a program that can analyze every possible combination in an astrological chart and give us an accurate computer-generated report that is unique to every single person's natal chart.,astrology,"Some think it's possible. Some say it's not mathematically possible. Of course, the sampling below doesn't even begin to cover all the altering factors for a chart delineation, but it certainly does answer our question.  u/thatotherothergirl has worked out the math, just using only the Moon as an example to work from:

You get so close to infinity combinations so fast, it's not gonna be possible. Let's do some back of envelope math, starting with moon, like you said.

12 possible moon signs

AND 12 possible rising signs

AND 12 possible sun signs

AND 3 possible mercury signs (only gets so far from the sun)

AND 3 possible venus signs (see above) *sorry, typo: should read 5*

AND 12 possible mars signs

AND 12 possible jupiter signs

AND 12 possible saturn signs

let's break for a moment and see what we're at already in terms of combinations.

12\*12\*12\*2\*3\*12\*12\*12 = 6\*12\^6 = 17915904 -- almost 18 million combinations. Now let's add in the possible outer planet placements

AND 12 uranus placements

AND 12 neptune placements

AND 12 pluto placements

17915904\*12\^3 = 30958682112. Over 30 billion. Figuring out how many possible aspects the planets can make between them gets more complicated. But even just assigning one to each possible house roughly would square that final amount.

So 30958682112\^2 = 9.5844e+20 (meaning move that decimal place over to the right 20 spaces).

Now let's say you have a team of 1000 astrologers to work on this project. They create a specific interpretation of one whole chart combination possibility at a time. The average professional astrologer takes about 3 hours per chart for a paying client, not counting the time they are taking to counsel the client, just doing the upfront looking and note-making. So 9.5844e+20 \* 3 hours = 2.87532e+21 man (or woman) hours of chart interpretation. If each astrologer devoted 40 hours per week to this task, it would take 7.1883e+16 weeks to complete. There are 52 weeks in a year so 1.3823654e+15 or 1,382,365,400,000,000 years. The current estimated age of the universe is 13,800,000,000 years. **So this task would take 100171.405797 times the age of the universe to complete.** Again remember we aren't even accounting for aspects.

If every adult on earth spent 40 hours a week on this task, that's 5.7 billion people. It would take 242,520,242 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fd0jfo/lets_look_at_whether_it_is_possible_to_create_a/,93,Probably with ai like costar üòâ ,2020-03-03 20:05:08

What sign placements or house placements or aspects do you associate with procrastination?",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fbjuy0/astrological_indicators_that_can_point_towards/,94,"Neptune is a big one. I have mars in Scorpio in the eighth house as my chart ruler. This is supposed to give someone a really strong drive and endurance to do anything your passionate and committed to. However moon conjunct Neptune is one of my strong aspects (0 degree orb) and I have found this makes me COMPULSIVELY DAYDREAM about EVERYTHING I want to do more so instead of actually doing it. Pisces is also the ruler of my 12th house but I don‚Äôt really understand yet if that has even more significance with the moon Neptune aspect and it increasing procrastination tendencies. 
But moon conjunct Neptune makes for a very very sensitive person in every aspect and way there is to be sensitive. So in that case it can increase escapism behaviour - drugs, daydreaming, etc. 

However I have also noticed on the high side of this Neptune/Pisces aspect in a chart - if the person turns to surrendering to a higher power (which can be hard to understand until you actually experience surrendering to a higher power) amazing results can show in the persons life.

However, I think the change of the ages is actually massive and intense and I think it affects everyone around the world on a very personal level. 

The changes I have seen which I believe can be attributed to the rise of the age of aquarius are the following:

1. Intense, abrasive, instantaneous karma. The words you say, the energy you put out and the actions you take are mirrored back to you almost instantaneously.

2. Twin flame and karmic relationships. I believe Aquarius is the sign of karma which is why you see the rise of these twin flame and karmic relationships. 

3. An extraction of emotion from the world. People empathize less and sympathize less because we are no longer in the feeling sign of Pisces. Contrary to that, we are in one of the least feeling signs, Aquarius. 

4. The outing of sexual misconduct because Aquarius is the collective karma of our entire consciousness. 

5. The rise of hyper intellectualism because Aquarius is incredibly intellectual and a vey thinking sign.

6. A lowering of spirituality and religion throughout the world. People don‚Äôt cling to the unseen anymore.

966,9ha186,False,None,17,Notes On The Upcoming Aries Full Moon and what it could mean for you (9/24/2018),astrology,"(I was inspired to make this a separate thread in response to my post in the ""what happened to the news!"" thread. I'm sorry if you're seeing this twice, but I've also added some new info).

I am looking forward to this Full Moon as a time of culmination and movement, but just as easily, for some, it could be a time to pause and reflect. Here's my take:

Happening at 2 degrees of Aries, opposing the Sun at 2 degrees of Libra, highlighting the axis of self and others. This will be a full moon that certainly deals with our relationships to others. Central theme: where do my needs fall in relation to the people in my life, where can compromise be made, what conversations needs to be had, what relationships need tending, and, what may need to end. Sounds dramatic, and opposing planets always kind of insert tension. Look to where Aries and Libra fall in your chart in order to get context. For example, the moon will hit my 11th house and oppose the sun in my 5th. A consideration for me: are the connections, groups and friends I have in balance with the pleasure and joy I seek to create and have? And it can happen in your life, or just be something your observe in others.

I'm looking forward to it especially because Mars rules this Full Moon, and Mars is finally direct. Where the summer had many of our desires and pursuits on pause (and for good reason if you used it as a time of planning and reflection), September 24th, to me, marks the official end of this holding pattern. Aries, cardinal fire, wants to start, to move, and its ruling planet is finally done taking a nap. I always set intentions for what I want to experience during any moon cycle, and for this one it is the courage to finally make some moves, have some chats, and get out there to get what I want (especially because its an 11th house theme for me). It brings a physicality to any manifestation work you've been doing during this summer of downtime.

(Remembering that Mars can rule the physical body and Aries has ties to the first house of self: will the relationship I've been desiring finally show up in the form of an actual human man?! Just a fun lil thought I'm having. What have you been trying to manifest into your physical reality?)

Retrograde Mars may have hidden our courageousness and assertiveness for some time, or just our passion/desire, and his implied marriage to this Full Moon could mark a return to feeling an emotional joie de vivre!

But anyway, Saturn, also newly direct, is in the picture as the focal point of a T Square between he, the Sun and the Moon. Sobering. But ensures a practicality. Mars is also in a nice aspect to Saturn, so it could be that actions taken are done so in a tactful way, with a dutiful eye on what the long-term implications will be (rather than just having rash Aries movement, Saturn tames the fire, but could just as easily douse the joy for some. Depends.). And then Saturn and Uranus continue to have a nice little tango. Marrying the Uranian nature of change and re-calibration, with the action of Mars and Aries, with the integrity and structure of Saturn says to me that whatever may be endeavored upon during this Full Moon will have legs, substance, and long-term dividends. Saturn being the focal point of the T-Square is also where we can look to ease any tension felt with this Sun-Moon opposition. So that is looking for your saving grace in being patient, mature, wise, and approaching whatever comes up with a healthy detachment and with a calm affect. Saturn is the long game. Full Moon emotions are transient. Let Saturn anchor you. If need be.

Two other things of note: Chiron and Mercury are also joining in on the conversation here. Chiron will be conj the moon, and Mercury conj Sun. Each forming vestigial little legs to the T-Square. Sun spotlights, and Mercury is communication. Again, what needs to be said, and to whom? Moon is emotional landscaping and Chiron are the wounds therein. Potential for hurtful communication, given or received? Yes. But also potential for HEALING communication, given or received. Or healing that eventually does come from a conversation had. Again, this Libra-Aries axis has me thinking this is relationship oriented. Mercury is also the mind, so these conversations could be happening internally.

Mars is also over the south node again, where he was for that Lunar Eclipse in Aquarius this summer on July 26-17. Very well could be a continuing theme for whatever was brought up then, and could be a time where it meets its ending and culmination. South Node again hinting to some emotional discomfort, but all the same an opportunity for healing and cleared karma.

Some logistical notes:

-This full moon may be felt more strongly by people with cardinal sign placements (especially personal planets) between the degrees of 0-9.

-A Libra New Moon is to follow on October 8th, providing fertile ground to begin, begin again or refresh any relationship woes (or relationship endings) that could be provoked by this Full Moon. Or, it may solidify and reinvest in what may have started. It will be ruled by a newly retrograde Venus. More on that later, maybe.

-This is a Harvest Full Moon, falling in line with the Autumnal Equinox. A new season, a new beginning. A Harvest Moon is, well, when things come to harvest, placing another emphasis on what is to be received, enjoyed, and started with this Full Moon after putting in the work, spiritual or otherwise. Time to eat the fruits of your labor after a nonsense summer!

I think that's it.  Thanks for indulging me this!

*Summary:*

**Gemini** is a master of words, both written and spoken, and we may find ourselves less likely to strike back with our fists during this period and more likely to strike back with sarcasm and witty comebacks. Prepare to be provoked and debated!

In fact, this would be a really good time to hold presidential debates, but **Mars** will have long since moved out of **Gemini**. We could expect to see some reports and books being penned at this time (penned, not reviewed) that will greatly shape how we move forward in the future. Parliaments, congress and their own debates may become quite heated this month.

971,a8m0mm,False,None,15,The best christmas Present: an end to Retrograde Season,astrology,"This retrograde season has made a profound impact on me. I actually got into astrology just before it kicked off with Mar's reverse motion in the summer (which, though exciting and even reckless at times, seemed to last forever!). I had a chance to remember what type of active energy really gives me the thrill of living to the fullest. I went back to basics and found many of my peers and friends (and even literary characters!) to be excellent mentors and role models for my strengthening Mars aspect. Mars retrograde was a profound, prolonged wake up call after a few years where I had become outwardly passive and inwardly paralyzed. You don't know what you are capable of until you really test yourself!

Next Venus came along. The retrograde kicked off with me bungling a promising affair with a beautiful yet much younger vixen. After not having dated for years, the terrible, nightly self-inflicted pain of losing 'what could have been' ate at me until I stared deeply enough into it to find the treasure it had for me: I had to admit, finally and fully, that I had no idea what 'relationship' really meant. I had cultural ideas of the idea relationship, but I had never been brave enough to find my own relationship bliss. Venus also helped me become aware of just HOW MANY relationships we have in our lives, with people, pets, ideas, vices, habits, objects -- everything is in relationship. This realization is just a step away from the holy grail, enlightenment, oneness, normality -- whatever you want to call it. Venus deserves the attention we heap upon her.

And finally, Mercury. The mind. Through my later 20s, I felt like parts of my brain became less and less accessible to me. It wasn't a total loss: I became intensely perceptive of subtle energies. The flows that drive so much yet normally pass conscious attention. But the basic, lucid mental functioning required of anyone who wishes to convey a point, was slipping away from me. I am a Gemini Sun, my natal Mercury is in Gemini, and this loss of focus and mental discipline was a very painful and frustrating phase to live through. Mercury retrogrades are fairly frequent, but I think we have to admit that this one is especially special. Not only is it happening at the end of two other major retrogrades, acting as the golden cap of knowledge upon the pyramid of experience, but we also see it occurring in Sagittarius at the very beginning of Jupiter's glorious 12-year homecoming. The higher mind and the lower mind. Woo and reason. The King of the Gods, and his Swift Messenger. Synchronize your watches, ladies and gentlemen. 


I was looking up some important dates for when to take a ritually symbolic infused epsom salt bath. And it struck me: Mercury leaves it retrograde shadow on December 24th. That means when we wake up Christ-mas day, it will be the first day of a new life. A life after the trials and tribulations of retrograde season. Enough! Life calls again, we all have our new operating system. Now is the time to see what it is capable of.

I've definitely found this over the years. A few off the top of my head:

Gemini: Geminis have a strong self-righteous, argumentative, often bluntly rude aspect that is very overlooked. I've known many Geminis and not one hasn't had this. They really think they know best in most cases.

Cancer: I feel as if the caring aspects of this sign are highly over-played. I'm sure there are some very caring Cancers, but I've met maybe one, and only to her own kid.

Leo: Leos have a major quiet side that is often ignored. Even very gregarious Leos have the capacity to be extremely quiet and distant at home, or when they don't feel the need to perform.

Libra: I feel like the cardinal, determined aspect of Libra is often downplayed. And their love of trying to make people mad and being rebels.

Sagittarius: The Sagittarius description often reads like a clown, and overlooks their almost universal propensity for anxiety and intense spells of negative emotion.

Capricorn: I feel like the Capricorn love of creature comforts is often overlooked. It is an earth sign.

Aquarius: Yes, they are all a bit eccentric, but they are also capable of being quite calculating.

Thoughts? Any others you've noticed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/971e9c/downplayed_or_overlooked_aspects_of_certain_sun/,88,"Disagree with most of what you wrote. 

No to anxiety for Sags. 

Why would Leo's perform when they are alone? They wouldn't.  So this observation makes no sense. 

If a Libra is trying to make people mad it's from their Scorpio energy not Libra energy. 

Who wouldn't enjoy comforts?Of course Capricorn does; they just won't indulge and go overboard because they can get by on the bare minimum.

I want all of you and none of you at the same time. I want to know all of your secrets, all of them, I need them. In a crowd I have already assessed you, looked at your friends, your shoes, your hair, everything that can give me a sense of who you are, I have looked at. In work, I can be a strategist and look at all my options, I need to be in control of what happens to my career. The few friends I have know I am an open door, they can come and go as they please. I don't really need to hang out to know your my friend, but if you need it than I am happy to make room for you. In love, I will tell you stuff that even has me questioning ""WTF"", ex: I want your babies. <---- I am well aware of the financials of a kid and understand that the relationship isn't at that stage, and we should slowly make our way there, but fuck it, it feels good to say. It's my creepy ass way of saying "" i care for you, i am here for you, I like your face""

982,bq4aar,False,None,37,The Culmination of the last 6 months: Full Moon in Scorpio,astrology,"Hello! Mai Gaia here! Full Moons bring around a culmination of lessons. These lessons have dated back 6 months to the previous new moon in that sign. Think back to the New Moon in Scorpio we had in November. What new seeds did you plant then? How have they manifested? Who are you now?

**Full Article:** [**Full Moon in Scorpio 2019**](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/05/18/full-moon-in-scorpio-the-butterfly-emerges/)

*Summary:*

**Scorpio** is best represented by the phoenix. After one final blaze of glory, the phoenix fizzles and dies, cremating itself and falling into a pile of ash. In that ash is a tiny chick ‚Äì the phoenix reborn, and it will grow to be stronger in this incarnation that it was previously. This is the cycle of life and death that manifests within **Scorpio**. 

This **Scorpio** full moon will be lightly influenced by several different planets. A **sextile** to both [***Pluto***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/pluto-retrograde-in-capricorn-horoscope-april-24th-october-2nd/) and [***Saturn retrograde***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/saturn-retrograde-in-capricorn-horoscope-april-29-september-18/) while opposing [***Mercury in Taurus***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/05/06/mercury-enters-taurus-solid-decisions/) will highlight the [***energies at play yesterday.***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/05/17/daily-forecast-for-may-17-2019-retrograde-revelations/) In order to achieve, you often have to tear down and rebuild what you‚Äôve made. **Mercury** wants to keep thinking in one direction, as **Taurus** often does, but the **Moon in Scorpio** has a need to let it all go so it can change and be reborn. Those who have succeeded have failed thousands of more times than their peers, and understand that sometimes you need a new approach to solve a problem. **Mercury in Taurus** would rather sit in their failure and accept it as reality, whereas **Scorpio** would burn it all down and try again. 

In order to metamorphose, a caterpillar must give up their identity before becoming a beautiful butterfly.
