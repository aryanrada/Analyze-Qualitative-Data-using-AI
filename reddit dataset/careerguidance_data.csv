0,g4d70n,False,Advice,158,Are you seriously trying to quit your job during a global pandemic and impending recession? o_O,careerguidance,"This will probably be downvoted to hell. That’s okay. 

But really, there has been an uptick in people posting about quitting their jobs. This isn’t to berate you. If you aren’t happy, you really should find a way to leave. Your mental health and professional fulfilment is much MUCH more important in the long run. 

HOWEVER, if you know that you don’t have a fat kitty saved up or a wealthy family to fall back on- please don’t make the jump just yet! The same goes for those in jobs with an easier ‘replacement index’ or ‘entry bar’ (cringe). Don’t do it!

Think long and hard. Where I am, the depression from the lockdown retrenchments alone has led to a rise in suicides. Quitting your job and then finding yourself in the cold may put you in a worse off position.

This is sounding harsh but it is coming from a good place. Things are going to work out. We just don’t know when. In the meantime, hang in there. Take this global lockdown time to plan your exit meticulously, save up and start skilling up for the jump. 

Good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g4d70n/are_you_seriously_trying_to_quit_your_job_during/,980,"Preach!!!!

1,gh3k6s,False,None,202,"Anyone else graduated, got in a 'career' and realise there was more to life than work?",careerguidance,"It's probably the number 1 thing driving me into depression. I can't come to terms with the fact that as I'm coming to 30, never have I felt more certain that the idea of a 'career' or working for the rest of my life in some repetitive job just to support my housing, family and retirement, is just NO life.

I'm not sure if it's bad experiences, or not knowing what exactly it is I want to do. Heck, I'm being paid 55k, but have already decided I will resign before the end of the year, leave London, and move back to my hometown (where opportunities are limited). This is simply because, after several years of slaving it out in an office, I so desperately miss feeling PURPOSE in life. Whether that's living under mum's roof and feeling the love of living with my family, being at University, and being surrounded by some of the best friends and richest experiences, being young and adventurous, traveling. Living life. 

Ever since I graduated and got into the 'workforce', aka, sitting at my corporate desk all day every day, life has been a misery. Eeach and every day typically morphs into the same scenario, wake up early, feel tired, commute, spend x hours under intense stress, commute home, change, cook, wash dishes, maybe go gym, bed, repeat. Then the weekend. Even weekends are duller than they used to be because people are so busy or spend time with their other halves or whatever else.

I came to realise through a lot of self-reflection during lockdown, that it's not the job, or the industry (I changed industry to mix it up and try something new). I realised that selling all of my time just to receive a paycheck, is nonsense. To the point where I'd rather resign and be unemployed whilst preparing for long-term travelling. It's strange because I want someone to tell me I'm barking mad, to leave a nice paid 55k job in the city for what I want - but you can't help what you feel. I'd imagine it's like a gay person and bottling up their feelings and then eventually coming out. For me, the truest thing I feel in my heart is that I just don't want to work 9-5 for the rest of my life, full stop. I want more out of life than living for the weekend, than defining my life and value by my 'work'. I can't derive value from anything else because I spend 80% of my waking time at work/commuting. No job has ever brought me any sense of purpose in life. It just draws me down further, gradually.

I just think it's an incredble shame, that we spend our lives in the pursuit of careers, selling our health, our time, our relationships and everything else just to put money in the bank and jump on the old societal bandwagon of buying a house and settling down. I thought after going into uni and then into the exciting world of financial services, that I had life set. But suddenly, I could not want it less. Even the idea of spending 30 years paying off a mortgage disinterests me. I find it a grim and miserable idea. What's wrong with me? But scarily, there's no viable alternative. It seems though a lot of people around my age who think similarly travel, so that's what I'm considering also.

Any others feel the same way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gh3k6s/anyone_else_graduated_got_in_a_career_and_realise/,927,"You’ll regret quitting when you realize you can’t find a job. The market is so competitive now. Add this pandemic, it’s even tougher. ",2020-05-10 15:32:34

3,gyyc4j,False,None,118,"I hate office culture, I hate my job, am burnt out and my mental health is suffering. After COVID dies down, I just want to work on building a life where I'll be happy. How can I make a realistic plan?",careerguidance,"Firstly, I'll just preface this post by saying that I KNOW I'm lucky to have kept my job during COVID. I'm aware that many people have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and been forced into difficult situations (and my heart goes out to them). However, I hope it can be taken into account that many of us are struggling in many different ways right now.

Without getting into too much detail, I've been extremely unhappy with my job for some time now and was planning on leaving until COVID happened. I'm a copywriter at a marketing company. I honestly hate sales and marketing writing. I also now feel stuck and like I can't plan a proper exit strategy. I'm currently experiencing total employee burnout and my performance is really starting to slip. I haven't slept at all in the past night and this happens regularly. I'm also not eating properly and am just dealing with anxiety, depression and fatigue. I can hardly think or focus on anything.

However, my general feelings about this really aren't a result of what's happened with COVID. I've honestly been feeling this way for quite a long time now. My company's current work from home setup has not improved any of this, but even pre-COVID my company was very poorly managed, with a lot of inexperienced people running the show and an extreme lack of organization. There's a lot of trite, stupid stuff the company forces everyone to do to try to ""make sure we work as a team"". There are constant, excessive amounts of hour-long, sometimes two hour-long meetings (with an increased frequency during our current WFH setup), where nobody contributes anything valuable to a conversation and where I get the sense that they're only arranged so that managers feel relevant. There's a whooole lot of office politics and people getting their own way by kissing up to the right people. It's all so repulsive, fake and so many of these processes just take away from my productivity.

As someone who is by nature quite introverted and who greatly dislikes having to navigate through annoying people problems, constantly having to tread around the politics, put on a face and play a game every week has become so mentally draining. And that's not even on top of all the work I have. It's a regular occurrence that I work MANY extra hours on top of my regular ones, all of which I'm not paid for. Before we started WFH, I'd regularly stay at the office until 8, sometimes 9pm trying to get work done. Now, I just keep working and don't turn my computer off until late hours in the day.

I've had several people tell me I should find a better job and that my current company isn't run well, but I honestly fear that every office job is like this. That every office job will involve having to say things that you wouldn't normally say to people for 8 hours a day, having to participate in pretentious, vapid and unproductive meetings for the sake of making the more ego-driven staff feel important, having to listen to coworkers talk more about other people than the work itself, being constantly distracted, having to tread on eggshells, etc. I know many have probably said something of the like before me, but it just seems like there should be so much more to life than this. I see other people at my company who seem so excited about the culture, who seem so personable and like they fit into it so well, and I can't help but wonder... is it just me who sees through all of this, or are they just better actors than I am?

I'm a writer and an artist and as much as I am preparing to hear answers such as ""this is life"", ""most people have to deal with this to get by financially"" and ""you won't make any money and will struggle taking an alternative route"", I really can't fathom the idea of spending another 10 years of my life dealing with office culture and putting my time and energy into a climate I despise so much. I really want to value myself, my talents and my life more than this. I really don't want to live anymore if this is all there is to life.

Does anyone have a story they can share about how they transitioned out of this lifestyle and took on a job that allowed them more time to work on their creative pursuits? Such as working at a coffee shop, restaurant or something where you can clock in/clock out a little more easily? I know taking a pay cut is inevitable, but I want to explore the possibility of actually living a lifestyle that will make me happier.

How should I have handled this situation?",careerguidance,"The allegedly misspelled word was 'Licence'. In America, and possible other countries that use American English, the word is spelled 'License'; in Canada and the UK, it is not. 

On my resume I have a section near the end that lists a few licences and certifications I have. The interview was for a very large engineering company that gave me the interview after a recommendation I received, so I assume they only glanced at the resume before giving me a call.

The interview itself was supposed to be an hour, but it only lasted around 45 minutes. I was being interviewed by a man, Joe, and a woman, Jane. Near the beginning of the interview Joe points something out on my resume to Jane and smirks, I knew the area of my resume he was looking at and assumed it was to do with a cert I have that doesn't formally expire so the formatting is weird.

The interview went really well, but it all fell apart at the end when we were wrapping up, Joe said ""just one last question, how do you not proofread a resume?"". He followed it up with a comment about how it otherwise looked great and I obviously put time into it, but this typo was jarring. I asked what typo and he just pointed at 'Licence'; my reaction was shock and a stunned silence before I said ""that's how you spell that"". Which he didn't like. He chuckled at my comment and sounded really annoyed when he just spat out that no, it wasn't. I didn't know what to say so I doubled down and he got very annoyed / angry and became pretty condescending. He started lecturing me about how he was trying to help me, how I obviously wouldn't be getting this job but in the future I should just focus on my spelling and not to attack interviewers. We started to argue and bicker over it and it was getting heated when he told me to leave. I said check your drivers licence and tell me how it's spelled there but he wouldn't. He just ended the interview on that note. While I packed my things and put my coat on, Jane checked, and told Joe that it's spelled licence there.

Current occupation: Medical Lab Assistant

Satisfaction: 6/10

I don't have an actual degree, more a collection of certificates and diplomas, but altogether it was a year of fine arts and three years of graphic design and illustration.

I don't know if job shadowing would have helped in my case, because graphic design (and other illustration/fine art related jobs) SEEM fun and cool, but no one really warns you about the downsides when you're a student -- little job security, tough competition, work being outsourced. There's also the fact that if you don't work for a design firm or in-house as a company graphic designer, then you pretty much have to freelance, and guess what, there's even less job security there. And, to succeed you have to be just as good at business, networking, and all that jazz as you are at the actual art/design.

It's not like we didn't visit countless design firms in my program (we did, and even went to NY to visit ad agencies and typography foundaries and the society of illustrators)... but somehow I guess I never realized that my personality and natural skillset did not fit these fields at all.

I almost screwed myself over trying to change careers, too... I jumped into a medical lab assistant program without really realizing that it would be 90% phlebotomy. Job shadowing really would have helped me there!! It's not the needles and blood that bothers me, it's the constant interaction with patients, a lot of whom are grumpy because they're fasting, or because they're sick, or scared of needles, or tired of waiting an hour for blood work... and so on. I'm an introvert and I tend to take on other people's emotions and it was extremely difficult to have so many different interactions with the public in one day.

Thankfully, my workplace has opportunities for lab assistants to work behind the scenes at the testing lab, receiving/sorting specimens and helping to set up cultures for the lab techs, and that's what I do now. No more interacting with the public. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to make that switch. I was seriously a basket case working as a phlebotomist, and I dreaded every day -- yet I couldn't change careers yet again because I'd exhausted all my sources of support. I'm so thankful I was able to make a lateral move like that.

Anyway.... I guess what I'm trying to say is that job shadowing can be useful at times but not in all situations! It really depends what kind of a headspace you're in, too. When I was younger I was much more willing to delude myself and gloss over troubling things about my proposed career. I was wearing rose-coloured glasses. ",2020-02-16 20:22:17

Oh but there's more. Much more. Not going into details on here, especially since I post on this subreddit with my other account. I wouldn't want people to identify who I am and know these sordid embarrassing details. But in my case, I not only ended up in a job I was overqualified for that I detest it, but it took years just to find that. Right after college, I struggled and was stuck working in retail. I ended up literally homeless because my parents reached a point where they said I was not able to stay at home anymore, and I didn't have enough money or credit to have my own place. Eventually when I got back on my feet, it was only because I worked 72 80-hour weeks in menial jobs such as at a restaurant and a warehouse. Just being able to climb from the Dirt 2 lower working class was a huge amount of hard work as it was. What's really pathetic is, my most recent job felt like a godsend to me, even though it was a job I was overqualified for that only required an associate's degree when I already had a bachelor's degree. After I started there, the job got worse. I got transferred to different times within five years. My job has multiple branch locations, so it's easy to short people around. Also, they stopped giving out any raises whatsoever as part of a salary freeze due to the government budget cuts. So for more than half the time I worked there, I received no raise in sight. The people that worked with seemed really cool and friendly when I first started, but over the years the people I worked with didn't seem so friendly. They seemed Katty and clicky.

25,hhj092,False,None,116,Is it worth leaving a job for the sake of your mental health?,careerguidance,"TL;DR: The behavior of my toxic boss has taken a toll on my mental health to the point where I now take medication and seek therapy to get through working with her. I have a part-time job on the side that doesn't make much or has any benefits. Is it worth leaving this job for the sake of my mental health and stick out working part-time until something better arrives? 

I've been working for an organization for the past year under an extremely toxic boss. At first, I accepted her micromanaging because I was working in a field that I had no experience in and wanted to make sure that I was doing my job correctly. After a few months at the organization, I was asked to take on additional responsibilities because a co-worker left and that only exacerbated my working relationship with my boss. She constantly lied to me saying that the other manager I was assisting thought I was doing a horrible job and didn't understand why I was doing what I was doing. She demeaned my work performance (whilst managing two brand new roles), telling me I was unqualified to do even the basic functions of my job. I try to work as independently as possible, but because of her micromanagement style, she doesn't hesitate to complain to directors that she constantly has to manage my work. I've tried going back to the directors about this, and they are unwilling to hear my side of things. 

But as a result of the constant undermining, I've started to notice a decline in my performance. I'm constantly on-edge with everything I do and say. Not only does she negatively critique my work and performance, but she also doesn't hesitate to criticize the way I write my emails to vendors and other associates too. It's gotten to the point where I'm petrified responding back to any email I receive. Currently, I'm going to a therapist to help me cope with her behavior and started taking anti-anxiety medication.

I spoke with the person that had the position before me and they ended up leaving the role after five months due to the stress and anxiety our boss caused. 

I've worked in other high-pressure roles in the past but nothing compares to working with her. 

Luckily, I'm in a good position financially if I need to quit. I also have a part-time job that I've had for 15 years that's not a part of my career path, but can offer a temporary income (albeit not much).  Would it be worth leaving this role to work on my mental health and wait for something better to come around?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hhj092/is_it_worth_leaving_a_job_for_the_sake_of_your/,460,"It’s all about how much you care. 
I was in the exact same position as you few months back until I realised.. why do I care so much? I’m just there for a pay check. Now if I do something wrong, I ask for feedback.

If anything, I now have started liking the way he works and feel I’m learning so much more. I also have an anxiety disorder and can say that you should really only take medication if that is the last straw. If nothing else helps. 
Just say f*ck it and focus on something that actually matters for yourself and your life. A random manager at X point in your life is rarely that!

What should I do?,careerguidance,"I'm really not a fan of forced socialization (especially when it's organized ""team activities""), mainly because the type of work I do at my company (and in general) is very solitary and when I have a lot on my plate, I have always seen zero benefit in having to step away from my work and socialize in a way that doesn't feel natural for me.

Right now, my company is obviously working at home because of COVID. When I found out that we'd be working from home for an extended period of time, I was honestly really happy. As someone whose job requires a lot of focus and solitude, I really thrive when I'm just by myself and can zone in on my work without distractions. However, management keeps speaking to our company like they are worried about us all being shut-in and not being in the office. We're now forced to have some meetings every day (over Zoom), that we otherwise have once or twice a week in the office (for a couple of them, it's starting to seem like people don't know what to talk about). In addition to this, management keeps planning all of these ""social"" activities over Zoom that they aren't making voluntary.

I'm the only person who has my role at my company and we've taken a hard hit because of COVID. As such, I've actually had a huge increase in my workload since this has happened, which I've tried desperately to stay on top of. I won't lie - this situation has caused me to feel extremely burnt out and stressed as I'm trying my best to cope with everything. I feel like my main duty is to do my job and stay on top of it, and having to keep breaking my focus is making this so much tougher. I just want to be at home and focus on my work so I can get through this, and all of this forced social crap is infuriating.

I don't want to say something that will get me into any trouble, but I also don't understand why they are ""forcing"" these activities and not sort of advertising them for people to do if they wish/if they have spare time.

30,e22niy,False,None,210,What is it about the 9-5 corporate life that seems to suck my soul away despite having worked much harder in university?,careerguidance,"When I was in college, I remember studying all the time, morning and night. Weekends were definitely spent studying and catching up on work. Schoolwork was a 24/7 kind of thing, and it was certainly exacerbated by my school’s quarter system. I probably put in at minimum 2X more work than what I’m doing now in my corporate job. 

Now contrast this to worklife now, and it’s fairly light in comparison.  There’s usually a cutoff time for work, meaning I can just shut off after like 6pmish. I don’t work weekends and the pay is alright. Some days I only have to put in around 4 hours of “real work” in the office. My job is not repetitive either. I work in software product management, not like data entry, accounting, or something like that. 

And yet, I’m feeling much more depressed and drained mentally for some reason. I’ve never had this feeling in my life before, and I’m actually not sure why because objectively speaking, the “work” is less than what I did in college. 

Basically, it feels like a dementor is sucking out all my energy and mood every day. When I get home I have to take a nap and my mind just shuts off.  At first, it wasn’t too bad, but then this never ending cycle started accumulating.  The days started to blend, then the weeks, now I feel like I’m counting in months. I don’t even get excited on holidays anymore because it’s a reminder of how little control over my time I have. 

I’m wondering if this is just a personal problem or there’s something I’m not catching. 

Why is it that I’m able to float around some corporate job and do 50% less work than what I did as student, get paid for it, and still feel like shit?

Is it part of the process of life? Is it the constant routine? The work actual job or company itself? Maybe because there is no more autonomy? Or perhaps my memory is selectively choosing to remember only the positive aspects of college? Or maybe I’m just mentally weak?

The thing is, I just landed my first full-time job at quite good IT company.

During my years of studying I never worked or even had an internship due to personal related health issues.

However, now, here I am, and I am in some state of shock.

How can it be that after all these struggles and years of studying - this office full-time job IS the ultimate goal that about which we should dream and fight to reach?

It's not that I don't want to work. I realize that is absolutely neccessary part of life. I always loved studying, doing stuff... It's quite okay to me to spend most time of the day just working hard.

The worse thing? I get bored. That's what drive s me insane. While I can do more and do better, it made me realize my biggest problem is being bored. First world problems my god, I really feel spoiled now.

My advice to you would be this:
We have the goals and aspirations, these are unfounded for the most part (we dont really know what the other side will be like until we are there). We can do our best to predict  and we might even get in our own heads to create a reality that isn't there or doesn't need to be but it's our responsibility to understand this and do what we can to really understand our situation and circumstances. You have the advantaged of leverage, use this and develop hobbies and or more education to go farther and do more.

We are often told school > job > retirement but it is SOO much more complex than that. School is only a couple years of your life, you still have so many more years ahead. The only way to find fulfillment is to keep moving forward and I absolutely hate that that's true but it is. Nobody is going to be happy being stagnated.

Keep going, you have it good compared to the majority of the world, use this to propel yourself beyond your current state and be EVEN better. This sounds a bit cheesy, but this is also coming from a cynic who used to contemplate suicide on a daily basis because I realized what you did but I didn't understand the purpose behind all of it which most people seldom tell you about - let alone know.

A lot of my day-to-day life is figuring things out and wondering where I'm heading and going. Most of the time, I do not know what I am doing, I am just guessing, what to eat for dinner, where to go on my day off, what jobs to apply for, everything in life is sort of guessing for me. I don't mind it, but there's no one to essentially hold your hand, and I'm wondering if other people felt the same about all this. Guessing where to go, guessing what job to take.

In high school and college, everything is given to you. Your schedule, your friends, essentially, your life. With being a free man, you have so much time at your disposal and it's kind of bizarre not to try to make anything of it.

Now I feel incredible guilt just leaving and coming home daily, putting her at risk. Her health, thankfully, is pretty good. She's a lovely person and I couldn't live with myself knowing I harmed her.

I drive under freeway signs that say to stay home.  I'm so tormented on what is the right thing to do. People scrambling to get jobs, I have a crappy one but, who cares, it's money coming in. If my mom didn't now rely on me so much, I would just move out but she does require a bit of daily care.

How can I fix this?",careerguidance,"I held a 15 minute design presentation to two Product owners a few months ago, it was to explain how a new design will affect the way that their teams will be working. During the presentation I kept on getting interrupted - as I only had 15 mins of their time, i felt frustrated and might have unconsciously been thinking negatively so i accidentally added an ""f"" word in one of my example scenarios while I was explaining. I have since apologised especially when one of the PO brought it up during one of our lunch gatherings - I understood that its unprofessional.

It had been months since the incident happened but the same PO who was in the meeting is still acting very passive aggressive towards me. For example, today she attempted to embarrass me in front of everyone during our remote meetings by asking if I'm working inside a toilet.. after that, we had a group picture on ZOOM and someone decided to use Donald Trump as their profile picture, since I was the one who took a screenshot of the group picture she accused me of adding in Donald Trump after sharing it to the group.. and she broadcasted it to everyone in our group chat.

To my defence, I am not the only one who curses in the meetings but it seems that she's just targeting me, what should I do? and please don't lecture me how wrong it was to curse, I've beaten myself too much about it already.

I had an interview that I felt went great a couple weeks ago but got rejected and no feedback as to why. This is the rejection that has really cut me up.

I KNOW I have the ability to be a great employee and have lots of great attributes but no employer can see this and it’s starting to cause havoc on my mental health. I’ve done all the hard work through university and beyond and it all feels worthless. I feel worthless. How do I get out of this mental black hole? How do you stop the constant rejection impacting your mental health?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ho9icr/how_do_you_stop_constant_job_rejections_effecting/,387,"For me, it's virtually impossible.  There's only so many job rejections that I can tolerate, you know?  I am really the very worst prospective employee that you want to reject, seriously.  I have a set limit as to how many job rejections I can literally tolerate in a row.  Let's say the number is 15 sequential job rejections....

So with each job rejection I get, I always ask WHY I was rejected.  Now some people say that I'm not entitled to an answer, but I sorely beg to differ.  I was the one who took the time to get my resume ready for YOU, and I took the time to fill out your lengthy-ass application.  Therefore, you at least OWE me a detailed one or two-sentence explanation as to why you rejected me, and the explanation CANNOT be something like, ""We hired a candidate with better qualifications.""  Well, WHAT qualifications does that person have that make him/her better than me?  I want to know so that I can actually GET those qualifications if I don't have them, know what I mean?  I also require an answer for a rejection because if I'm making a mistake, I will know NOT to make the same mistake for future applications I send out, and thus won't be wasting my damn time.  Following me so far?  Ok, good...the fun has yet to begin...

This is my standard operating procedure (SOP) for dealing with a job rejection.  Now in the early rejection phase (say, for the first 5 rejections in a row), I only email them back once asking why I was rejected.  Then when we get to the 6th through 10th rejection, I start getting more insistent...maybe 3 emails or so for each rejection.  THEN, when we get to the 11th through 15th sequential rejection, the anger starts building up to a grand crescendo, to the point of harassment actually.  I call them up, I leave voicemails, I send up to 10 emails asking for a legitimate explanation as to why exactly I was refused employment for the 13th time.

For the lucky 15th prospective employer who rejects me, that's the lucky winner!  They get a death threat, folks!  Yes!  A death threat!  (As you can tell, I am quite psychopathic, having experienced serious career trauma over the past 15 years...\*hint\* that's where my 15th job rejection limit comes from!)  Lord, when is that universal basic income going to become a reality so that at least your food and rent are covered at the bare minimum???  This would alleviate SO much anguish and potential death...seriously!!!!  To me, these job rejections are direct denials of my right to earn a living so that I can actually survive and thrive, so if you deny ME that, I'll sure as hell make sure that you don't have that right either.

How to Find and Develop Your Passion in Life

How do people find their passion? That thing that makes them get out of bed every morning
excited to face the day? Did they always know what it was or did they learn later in life?

First of all, your passion is not necessarily going to be what you do for a living. You can be
great at your job even if it’s not what your passionate about. So let’s divide this exercise into
two parts: FINDING YOUR PASSION and FINDING A JOB YOU ARE OK WITH AND THAT
ENABLES YOU TO PURSUE YOUR PASSION. 

Take a Deep Breath
Before we begin we have to be aware that you’re going to feel some discomfort at some point during the exercise. Fear, insecurities, impostor syndrome, what ifs. That’s all normal because change is hard, you’ve probably been in your comfort zone of misery at your job or in your present lifestyle for a while and it’s hard to push yourself out of that comfort zone. For now, just ignore the discomfort. Later we’ll deal with your limits, how far you’re willing to venture out of the zone.

Next, turn off your NEGATIVE SELF-TALK. It’s going to want to say things like, “I could learn how to dance. I’ve always wanted to do that. But there’s no way I can become a dancer at my age!” or “I’ve always wanted to learn how to fly a plane. But it must be so hard. I don’t
think I have the time. Plus it must be expensive.” Finding your passion is about taking action
not about listening to that negative little voice in your head that keeps you paralized with fear and doubt. It’s not about practicalities right now. It’s about finding out what your passion is and whether your passion is going to be a part of your job or something you do outside of your work.

Steps to Your Passion
Get a notebook and let's get started!

What would you be willing to do without getting paid?
What can you do for hours without getting bored?
How would you spend your time if money weren’t a problem?
What do you love to talk about when you’re with friends?
Who are you jealous of because of the job they have?
Look back at your life and identify moments when you felt great.  What were you doing? What elements combined to make those moments great?

Have you considered that your passion may be something you haven’t tried yet?  If you’ve lived in your comfort zone for a long time, chances are you haven’t tried new things much. What things have you always wanted to try but haven’t yet?  Painting? Learning a language? Writing a book?

What things have you done that you’re proud of?

Close your eyes and imagine yourself 5 years in the future. What are you doing? What lifestyle are you living?

Time to Do Some Cooking
Now, start combining hard skills, soft skills and the traits mentioned by the people who know you best.

Let’s imagine these are all ingredients and if we combine some of them, we can
bake a cake, if we combine others, we can prepare a salad.  They’re not the same food, but they’re both delicious.  For example, I speak 3 languages + I’m diplomatic + I love to travel = I can be a foreign language teacher abroad. On the other hand, I’m organized + I’m a good writer + I love reading = I can become a freelance editor or copywriter.

As you can see, those are two very different jobs, yet we arrived at both of them combining my different skills.

Steps to Finding the Job You’re OK with
As mentioned before, it may turn out that your passion is not your job and that's fine. That's true for most of us. But it's important to find work that doesn't make you miserable. So let's go back to the notebook!

List the jobs you definitely do not want to do or would even consider.

Make a list of your HARD skills. These are measurable abilities, school learned abilities such as writing, reading, math, using computer software.

Make a list of your SOFT skills. Traits such as etiquette, diplomacy, communication, listening, getting along with people.

Talk to your friends and family and ask them to (honestly!) describe your personality. Take notes.

What were you good at in school/college (it doesn’t matter if you liked it or not)?
What have you been good at in the jobs you’ve had throughout your life?
What matters to you the most when it comes to a career/job: The salary? The hours?
The work environment? Doing something you excel at?

Your Passion
Be flexible. A study by Stanford psychologists found that most people have the mistaken belief that a passion is something you find easy to do. When people pursued their passion and encountered challenges, they gave up. The researchers further studied mindsets about interests in an experiment where a group of students who identified as “techie” or “artsy” were given two articles to read, one tech related and the other related to the humanities.

Students who had a fixed mindset about their interests were less open to reading an article that was outside their area. Unfortunately, focusing one one area could prevent you from finding your passion, which could happen when you bring different fields together, when you see connections between fields that you might not have thought of before.

A Growth Mindset is More Likely to Lead to Your Passion
In another experiment, researchers showed students an interesting video about the origin
of the universe. Most students were fascinated. Then they were asked to read a
challenging scientific article on the same topic. A lot of students lost their initial
excitement and the ones whose enthusiasm for the topic dropped completely were those
who had a fixed mindset about their interest. People who may be interested in a subject
can change their mind when it becomes too challenging.

“Develop” Instead of “Find”
Researchers concluded that “Developing your Passion” is more appropriate than “Finding
Your Passion,” because development requires commitment, seeing things through even
when they become difficult.

Another path to your passion can be developing valuable skills that will lead to greater
career satisfaction because you’ll be financially stable and more likely to develop a passion
for a field you’ve cultivated deep expertise in. In other words, first establish the lifestyle you
want for yourself and then fit a career around your vision. First get your basic needs taken
care of by creating a plan for your life and part of that plan is the development of your
Passion.

Passion Still Requires Discipline
But no matter which approach you choose to follow, you will never develop your passion if you keep switching directions and following every shiny object that crosses your path.

Even if they have a natural talent, ballet dancers invest years of discipline and hard work on their passion. So do athletes. So do millionaires. And so will YOU.

Now step back and look at the big picture.
Is your passion something you can incorporate into your career/job?

Is it something you will be doing on your personal time, after you do your work at a job that is just FINE; it’s not your passion, but it allows you to live well and pursue your passion? ",2019-11-04 19:30:59

48,fu5o77,False,None,83,How do I tell the family I've been babysitting for that I need to be getting paid more then $25 a day?,careerguidance,"Originally posted somewhere else but it got taken down and said I should post here. So please help me out. 

I babysit for this family. They have a 3 year old who I love to death. I've known the mom ever since I was little because my parents are friends with hers. The mom is 23 now. She WAS a single parent when she first needed me to babysit back in September. And now she is married. They are both cops that work in the jails. 

When she first needed me she was a single mom and I told her to pay me as much as she could and she told me she could only do $25 a day (she only needs me Saturday and sunday). So I was okay with it because that's all she could afford. I originally would start at 12:45 PM and go till 9:30 -10 pm and then she started to need me earlier. From 12:45, 12:30, 12:00, 11:30 am, 11am, and sometimes to 10am.

She ended up getting more serious with her boyfriend and he moved in so I ended up getting off around 7 PM. Now they're married so they have two incomes coming in. Their schedules got changed so now they both work from 5:30 am to 2pm, so they need me to come over at 4:45am till 3 PM. 

I did the math for how much im getting paid by the hour and it's around $2.72. I live with my boyfriend now, and with the whole coronavirus this is my only source of income since the other family I baby sat for doesn't need me any more.  I'm not sure if I should tell her I need to be getting paid more and I'm not sure how to tell her especially because when I needed to be paid in advance she did that for me and gave me $150. I ended up almost working all the days off for it, but she recently just told me that she decided to forget about it and started paying me again, so now I'd feel bad If I told her I need to be paid more

54,fgu3un,False,None,83,How do I play out my final two weeks when my supervisor and coworkers are taking my resignation personally?,careerguidance,"I have been working with the same company for the past 2 1/2 years. Some of us were part of a major company initiative, and there is a strong since of camaraderie amongst those who were part of it and are still with the company. As a result of my strong work performance and the respect I share with my peers, my boss pegged me as the ""point person"" for my department - which involves setting guidelines and training new employees within my wing of the operation.

*You can imagine their surprise when I put in my two-week notice a few days ago.*

Despite the good vibes mentioned earlier, I had not received a raise or promotion since I started. I met with my boss and supervisor several times, and was told the earliest they could promote me or give me a raise was in 6-7 months from now. I recently took an interview with another company, and offered the promotion and raise I was looking for. I accepted it because it's what's best for my career.

Since my boss and my direct supervisor were both out of the office on the day I received the offer and my start date with the new company is soon, I e-mailed them a professional note announcing my resignation effective in two weeks and thanking them for their support during my time with them. My coworkers' reaction upon finding out from my boss and supervisor have been all over the map.

My supervisor, who I shared a good relationship with, didn't talk to me for three days. When he finally met with me behind closed doors, he berated me for leaving - though also asked if there is any counteroffer the company could make after saying I 'burned a bridge' with him, which was sort of a weird 180. A couple of other coworkers who are part of the ""camaraderie"" still haven't spoken to me. My boss, though he understands my decision, was not shy about mentioning the staffing woes the department is now in (we were understaffed even before I put in notice). On the contrary, one superior  who I thought would be indifferent has become my biggest supporter, wishing me the best and saying the company played itself by not promoting me when they should have.

55,hjty1b,False,Education & Qualifications,129,Anyone who realized that what they want to do in life is completely different from what they studied in college? How did you go about it?,careerguidance,"So, I’ve always been interested in many things, which made it hard for me to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I’ve tried both the natural and the social sciences, but eventually went for a BA in English. After all, I loved writing and reading.

After about three years of working, I just realized that writing for a living just isn’t for me. Now, I want to go back to one of my first loves—environment and the natural world. 

How do I bridge this knowledge gap? Literally the only thing I can do is write. Right now, my plan is to work as a writer or communications officer in related agencies, then later pursue a master’s degree once I have enough work experience. Is this the right approach?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Especially someone who also switched from the arts to the sciences? How did you do it? How difficult was it to transition to a completely different field?

I just want to clarify a few things since they’re often brought up:

- I’m currently taking some online courses on the subject to see if I’d really be interested in them, as well as to narrow down my interests. I’m not planning to look for jobs until next year, so I have a lot of time! (Keeping my writing job for now.)
- Once the pandemic dies down, I do plan on volunteering on an environmental advocacy org. It’s a little intimidating because I’ve never done this before, but I do want to have hands-on experience (and network while I’m at it).
- I don’t plan going straight back to school! I really want to have some related experience in the field before I do and be really sure I like the subject. I don’t want to make the same mistake again.
- I know I did say I started to “hate” writing, but I also know that it’s my most marketable skill right now. The positions I’m targeting are definitely writing-related. If this pans out, maybe I’d end up sticking with it, who knows.
- I’m doing content writing right now, which has been really soul-sucking for me. Plus, I’ve also stopped doing creative writing, which was my major and something I thought I’d want to do for the rest of my life. (Hence, the “I hate writing” bit.) But I know there’s more to writing than long-form content and creative works, so I’m now exploring other forms, like technical, social media, and mass media writing, etc. I’m liking them better so far (esp news writing).",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hjty1b/anyone_who_realized_that_what_they_want_to_do_in/,367,"I haven't been on this in years, but it just so happened that I was checking my email in regards to something directly related to this and saw the notification for this thread.

Work in sales and  have done for just shy of a year, before that I was in a financial  brokerage for a year, and an investment bank for a year. Graduated in Business Management in the UK, on a 4 year with a placement.

The  thing is and this has been the case for all my life and probably is for  many - there's just not something I am so passionate about that I want  to invest all my time specialising in. I left finance because I actually  hated the environment, the people. It was so toxic at one point I  resigned from my brokerage and luckily landed a job in tech sales. It's  now been just shy of a year and there's always so much pressure with  targets and aside from COVID for one moment, your job is under threat  after a period of time if you don't keep up with the numbers.

As  I approach 30, I have come to realise that life ISN'T worth this kind  of stress. And yet I'm earning £50k GBP which is in terms of averages,  pretty decent going for a 29 year old. But it's somehow not important to  me. If anything, it's easy to compare to some of my younger friends who  are in banking and earn even more than that and will continue to earn  more and more. I find myself looking up and thinking I should be doing  better, rather than looking down at say retail workers who earn 20k for  example. Heck, I'm talking to a Brazilian lady on a dating app who is 35  and works in a retail store as well as a restaurant receptionist - I  suddenly look much better than her. It's easy to forget.

But  I think I would be happier if you told me that I found my  girlfriend/wife to be, and was earning 20k, rather than earning say 50k  as I am and being single. There's just nothing that makes me think life  is worth repeating day in day out just to pay a mortgage, retire, and  then die. It just feels so unimportant. I guess I was never lucky enough  to discover my 'passion' from a young age and implement it into my  work. I'm into football but don't want any job around that other than be  a professional football player, which I am not.

I  recently started to look into coding and weigh up whether this would be  worth my time. It's actually interesting, but reading between the lines  it seems that it's going to be very challenging finding work in this  area without a degree, notto mention take years to learn enough to be  job ready.

I just feel kind of  lost and always have done with 'work'. Like there's never been an  underlying purpose/motivation behind it.

It's not a binary.  You can make $50k and date more.  You can make time for a hobby, for a passion, to diet, to do whatever you want to do.

What are some good ideas to consider moving forward?",careerguidance,"I’m sure I’m one of MANY people posting about this same problem, so I’ll first just apologize about this in advance. I’ll also preface this post by saying that I know I’m fortunate to not be out of work right now.

I’ve been pretty unhappy with my job for some time now, and right around this time was when I was planning to look for another one (ironically, I had gone on a trip before COVID-19 broke out and my plan was to do this after I got back home). In summary, here are the reasons why:

* Long hours, understaffing and me agreeing to way too much in the past year has led to me wearing far too many hats. I’m burnt out, never able to complete everything each week and management is aware, but doesn’t seem to do anything about it.
* My role has changed from one where I was supposed to be a creative contributor to my company to one where I just manage and oversee logistics all day. It wasn’t what I signed up to do and I don’t even get to do any of the responsibilities I was originally given when I started (which was work I actually enjoyed, is in line with my skill set and that was valuable for both the company and my resume). Duties that were once mine are now just outsourced by third parties and managed by me. It's definitely not the same thing as what I joined to do, at all.
* Management knows I want to go back to my original duties and have repeatedly told me they will do this for me and reevaluate processes, only to then keep roping me into the very duties (mentioned above) that keep me from doing just that and doing absolutely nothing they promise.
* Management is young, inexperienced and not good at fixing problems when they’re brought to attention. This results in me and other colleagues getting the brunt of other people’s problems.
* According to market trends (at least before COVID), I was being underpaid and overworked for this role. I’m not sure if this still stands now.

Overall, I’ve been unhappy for quite some time now and I don’t feel like this job is at all aligned with my career goals at all. I’ve managed to keep my job and work from home during the pandemic, which makes me feel like an even bigger POS for complaining. But with that being said, I can tell that taking our company online is already starting to worsen the lack of organization and alignment. On top of stress over what’s happening in the world right now, I know my mental health is not in great shape dealing with this role. Even prior to this, I was dealing with working late hours, extreme burnout and lack of sleep. I still want to make the best of my life and my career during this time and I know I’m not doing it here.

With all this being said, I am perfectly happy with working from home (I'm a bit of an introvert and actually fare really well with it) and the type of work I do is very easy to do remotely. Is it worth the risk to still look for something else right now or am I making a bad move?

I just graduated and while I have little hobbies of yoga, hanging with my dog and friends, shopping,  and smoking weed-I don’t know if any of that defines me. They’re also pretty basic and generic to try and mold your life around. I mean I know yoga can be a big part of life, but I think for me it’s just a way to relieve stress and pain. I think my lack of passion is proved by the fact that I have absolutely nothing enjoyable to do with all this free unemployed time while away from friends. I hate it. 

My one and only dream has been to have my own beautifully decorated studio apartment in the city with my dog. And one day far away, a mom. I literally just want to be independent. It’s hard to get there without any understanding of who you want to be. Maybe it’s because I have depression, but I’m not actually sad right now, just lost.

76,g6dwc8,False,None,71,"Is it worth it to leave a high paying job that makes me miserable, for one that pays less but doesn't make me cry daily?",careerguidance,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I work in the hospital lab in a very specialized position. Specialized to a point there are only 1500 of us in the country roughly. One of the bigger cons of this is I can't just go work somewhere else. If I had a family that lived here and something happened or I quit, I can't go to the town over or down the road, I would have to move hours away for another job. I feel like I am forever at the mercy of my employer.

&#x200B;

I got into 4 different masters programs when I finished college. I did so many different jobs, trying to find the one that felt right. My mom has always been money minded, so when I got into my graduate program with the expectation of making 75k+ a year, she was thrilled and pushed me to do it. I was excited, and this program had a higher salary and a higher liklihood of employment (though limited, they don't tell you that part). I started med school not fully knowing what it was, but got through everything just fine with great grades. During rotation year I remember thinking ""Is this what I want to do for the next 30 years of my life?""

&#x200B;

I started working at my current job a year ago. Two months in, I was already uncomfortable. The healthcare field is viscious, and our leaders in my group are as well. Since I've started I have seen the revoling door of employment, and have seen 8 people come and go since my first day, only 8 months ago. When I started, I was making 75k, and as a new graduate with more loans than that number I was happy. But as time went on, I became a wreck. My ex left me for a week because I would just come home and cry. I was miserable. I've applied to other places, but it's so specialized and so few positions anywhere even remotely close that I am SOL most of the time. I wondered why the people I worked under during rotations seemed so burnt out and miserable, saying the spark will go away fast, and now I know. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Recently it's gotten worse. Everybody's pay got cut at least 20-25%. My hours got increased, and I'm doing 55 hours a week now. I am constantly walking on eggshells waiting to get in trouble for sneezing when I should have coughed, knowing if even a whiff of something not perfect gets out that I will be absolutely fired. 

&#x200B;

Besides the employer issues, this job may physically be killing me. I'm pretty certain I will have a stroke by 40 with all this stress. Once I'm off work, I can't relax. On top of that, my back is constantly hurting, and that's just how it is and nothing can fix or prevent that. This job is also just relatively dangerous, and I've already gotten pneumonia and TB from patients before. 

&#x200B;

My passion is dead. It was short lived, it existed momentarily, but it's dead.

&#x200B;

I told my mom months ago I wasn't a fan, she told me it's just a phase. I told her in winter, again, suck it up you don't mean it. Now that the world is falling apart and the hospital is running itself and employers into the ground, I told her again that I'm not in love with this job. It makes good money, but I'm not happy. I can't have a family or relationship and feel happy knowing 1/3 of my day is spent in nonstop worry and anxiety. I told her I want to look elsewhere for other jobs, and she said I am being dramatic and need to stop, they put themselves on the line to hire a younger person, I have debt this is what being an adult is I need to suck it up, and this is just a rough patch. She's mainly concerned with the money I make, and it always. comes. down. to. the. money. At this point, making less than 50k terrifies me because of how she has made me feel over the years. 

&#x200B;

I have been searching for jobs, and i can find other ones in other fields. I would be making above 50k, but not as much as I am now. I feel like I failed though. I got into my program, I was the head of the student side of things, I was the first to get a job, I graduated, I got my license. I did it, and I don't want to do it forever.

Sure get to the building an hour or 45 minutes early if you have no idea where you are going or are taking public transit. But don't go IN until MAXIMUM 20 minutes prior, ideally 10 minutes before, showing you are prompt but not overzealous.

And then if you DO go in early and the administrator/receptionist tells you it's in your best interest to take off and come back 10-15 minutes prior to your interview BELIEVE THEM! Sure you can wait there but you are going to look awkward as fuck and if it's a good place HR will ask that person what vibe they got off you. 'Arrived very early and then didn't trust my advice about the company I work for' isn't going to fly.

And indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens, but even adults, think that being a professional MMA fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests, etc.

Recently I attempted to go pro at Magic The Gathering. I used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks. I won a small local tournament earlier this year so I decided I would go pro. But when I started this month I was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones I used to win at the local level. I practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash I put specifically for this career on a rainy day.

In addition I never thought how stressful and hard stuff I used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it. And I'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be! Every trick I used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and I could not develop any new strategy. In addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive.

So I am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like I did with Magic?

But I learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby (which I actually did with Magic after I decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again).

Has anyone here tried to go for the NBA or become a professional martial artist or played at esports as a pro gamer or other stuff you had a passion for as an amateur and backed out because of the shock of how hard a career is? Even going as far as temporarily abandoning the hobby because you grown to hate it for a while after attempting to go pro with it and seeing how much of a pain in the but doing your hobby is when you work at it for a living and not just for fun and games?

Please put your examples when you tried to go pro when you were younger!",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bztdbx/why_do_people_assume_just_because_you_love_a/,298,"I have a masters in playwriting and drama studies.

I still write scripts but it is such a profound relief to not have to depend on it to pay the bills! I can still work on it in my free time and book days off if needed to advise directors! 

There's no shame in getting yourself financially stable. I think the myth of ""if you want it bad enough you'll fight for it!"" While well-meaning, can be dangerously misleading and unrealistic.

I have pretty decent school results (UK), but no university degree.

I've had jobs before, like stores as a teenager, and worked for a while in the airport (a job my Dad got me), but I always had trouble with my family, wound up feeling disconnected from life and myself and developed drug addictions in my late teens, which got worse in my early 20s, which spiraled and wound up with me on Government assistance and schizoaffective disorder. But now I'm 29 and I've managed to quit drugs and restore my sanity and would like to contribute to society (and my own well being, since work is good for that).

90,egzvob,False,None,40,How do I stop trying to get personal validation from my job?,careerguidance,"Hey friends, sorry if the title isn't totally clear. Basically I had an epiphany yesterday, after I went the extra mile and busted my butt at my job for a project that turned out to not be worth the trouble. I'm on the east coast of the US, and one of our clients is in Alaska, so a four hour time difference. They told us a file had to be finished by the end of the day, so I decided to give up my plans for Friday night and bring my work laptop home so I could hop on as soon as I got an email from the client. But by the time their office closed at 9pm my time they hadn't gotten around to doing their end of things yet, so I had just wasted my evening for nothing. 

This type of thing is a pretty rare occurrence at my job, so this event is not a huge deal per se. I'm grateful I rarely have to take work home with me after hours. However, I just felt sort of disproportionately embarrassed and foolish for putting in that  much effort and giving up my plans for what turned out to be something less important than I thought it was. After some self reflection I realized I'm trying to somehow derive love and self-worth from my job, which is basically impossible in a corporate environment. I think it was drilled into me as a kid that my education was the most important thing, above social and other commitments, and I've just carried it over into my working life without realizing it.

I'm very grateful for my friends and family that give me social and emotional satisfaction, as well as my hobbies, but I guess I have still not come to terms that my job is just a job, not my life's calling, and doesn't give me much besides money and something to leave the house for. I guess basically my question is, how do you deal with the fact that your job isn't the center of your life? How do you begin to separate how you define yourself from how you spend the majority of your waking hours? Sorry if this is a little too philosophical or over-thinking things. I just haven't gotten it into my head yet that I can't just keep working harder until I earn self-esteem.

TL;DR: Just realized I'm stupidly trying to put in enough effort for a soulless corporate to love me and validate my existence somehow. Have others dealt with this epiphany, and how did you start to derive your self-worth elsewhere?

Where I work, they have a lot of free food around the office, which had allowed me to save A TON of money on groceries when I was working there as an intern, and now I don't have access to that anymore.

Well $NastyCoworker didn't like the changes at all. Started up on a soap box about how she is never listened to and how I wasted all this time on changes that she didn't want. Basically saying openly in a meeting that I am incompetent. My boss basically tiptoed around her the entire meeting and once we got done with the meeting I called him directly and he agreed that she was off her rocker and I had made changes she wanted.

I’ll try to summarize this, but I work in a high commission recruiting firm - placements typically earn you anywhere from $3,000-$12,000 Net commission - with that obviously comes a relatively low base salary. ($31,200 for the year)

I don’t want to do anything dumb because I’m new to my career and just graduated last May from college - but I quit my previous position at a 50k base to come here because the long term commission structure was so much higher.

Brief edit - the other recruiter works remote, there was no way to tell this candidate was spoken to because he didn’t follow policy.

 Me and a fellow co worker had spoken to a candidate however he had spoken to him a few hours prior and put him in for the position - however the employee did not follow any of the company policies. 

For anyone who has recruited you understand that the tracking system for candidates is huge to protect people’s work, I had actually qualified the candidate, gotten his updated resume, verified him, and added him to the system with him in my name and added notes. While the other worker briefly spoke to him, submitted him with an incorrect resume and was off the phone in 2 minutes. our company policy strictly states this means that it would go into my name because I had him in the database. because the other recruiter ignored all of this and the candidate had both of us submit him to the job (candidates can be sneaky like that sometimes)

Long story short the guy got the job and I’m looking at a $8500 commission minimum - but the owner is saying he might give it to the other employee because they’re friends and he’s been there for a while. The lead recruiter (my direct boss) is telling me how it’s not fair and if I wasn’t new then it would of at least been split 50-50. 

These placements take months to make, and I took a massive pay decrease to come to this company for this reason of high commission trades - but all my work is being stolen essentially in this instance, and I’m about to move closer to work in the next month or two so I don’t want to commit to a company if this is something which is going to constantly happen. 

Just want to hear your opinion on this because it’s going to bother me long terms and I genuinely cannot live off this base salary and dealing with student loans / rent at the same time when I can get a job with a 25-35% higher base salary in two weeks. My boss constantly is impressed with how hard I work and had fired 5 of the 11 recruiters in the office during the corona situation but kept me even though I was the newest - he texts me often to show his appreciation for my work and how it’ll all pay off soon - but then he goes and does this, it’s just hard to think past that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gc624n/my_boss_is_giving_my_8000_commission_to_another/,278,"1.

Anyone have any advice?",careerguidance,"I’m 27 years old and got the job I always said I wanted as a kid. I became a zookeeper. I went to school and got my bachelors degree in Environmental Science and have now been working as a zookeeper for a little over 2 years. I absolutely love the job and wake up most days happy to go to work. Growing up I listened to the advice of “do something you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life”. Which I guess is true but I am now realizing it may not be feasible/sustainable to live off of the amounted income for the rest of my life. There is pretty much no room for growth, very little to no pay raises or promotions, and you make the same amount as someone who has been working there for 30 years. 
I love the job and the work but I think my life outside of work is more important to me. Having to work weekends and holidays isn’t ideal. Paying rent, bills, buying groceries is tough with this pay and I have no savings accumulating. After having worked my ‘dream job’ and knowing what it is like, I have decided that making more money is more important to me to be able to have a better life outside of work.

110,hpbm4b,False,"Cleveland, OH",110,Is it morally wrong to choose a career that doesn't work to solve the world's most severe problems?,careerguidance,"I'm 22 and just graduated college. Naturally, I'm focusing on establishing a career. I've always been interested in the concept of work. Ever since the end of high school, I've thought a lot about why people work and how to have a fulfilling career. This is easily the aspect of my life which I seem to value most, although this value comes from a sense of duty/social obligation rather than my own interest. So there's this question that's been bugging me for awhile.

As I explore different career paths people are pursuing, I can't help but notice that so many of them seem to be kind of... worthless. I make this statement with a lot of skepticism because I don't want to be judgmental with so little information. It's just that I notice so many problems happening in the world: hunger, disease, mental illness, violent crime, oppression, war, poor education, accidents, etc. However, few of these issues are directly effecting me. I live a comfortable life of abundance, security, and all the pleasures one could ask for. Some of this is a result of my own doing, as I enjoy rewards I have earned, but far more of it is just a result of circumstance. I was born in the USA, I'm intelligent, I'm able-bodied, I have a close family, I had access to relatively good education, to name a few of my blessings. But I earned none of this. I don't feel guilty for winning the lottery of circumstance, but I do feel guilty for not helping those who didn't. So here's my question: **is it morally wrong to pursue a career that primarily serves or benefits those on the higher end of the quality of life scale instead of dedicating one's life to solve the world's more severe problems?**

I realize that it's difficult to measure the value produced by, say, a film studio. What if someone is inspired by a movie and decides to travel to a third world country and build a school? But still, it seems that a film studio is just a bunch of people spending time, money, and energy playing with cameras and lights, like a game, when there's people in the world who don't have food. How about another example, a marketing firm that works with fashion brands to sell more expensive sunglasses? I mean seriously? You're working day in and day out to push pieces of plastic people wear on their face so they're a little more comfortable seeing outside? While people are dying of infections diseases because they don't have sanitation infrastructure? Or how about a business accountant? Crunching numbers to make sure you're getting the best tax return so that you can pay your dividends to shareholders so they can buy a new set of golf clubs to hit balls around on huge grass fields where homeless people would be kicked out for sleeping because they have nowhere else to go? I know my perspective is limited and ill informed, but there is truth to the basic concept: people spend resources solving comparatively minor problems when there are very serious issues affecting others in the world.

**What do you think about this? Is it morally wrong to not try to solve the world's biggest problems, if you have the ability to do so? If so, how might we change this about the world? How do we motivate people to create value where is more needed?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hpbm4b/is_it_morally_wrong_to_choose_a_career_that/,276,"You’re 22 - there’s a lot of world and a lot of opportunity out there. Now is your chance to do something you’re passionate about, something exciting.  That may mean helping others, or it may mean another path.  

First you need to keep your lights on, food on your table, and to not be a burden yourself, on the public dole.  If you pursued a marginal value degree, think about what you might need to do to monetize it. Consider risk, and manage it - don’t run from it or run towards it.  Be smart. 

The greatest benefit to others will be when you have the time, resources and energy to put towards things that matter to you personally.  The bleeding heart, eating cat food and earning minimum wage, bless them for doing so, might not be the right path for everyone.  

And capitalism and creating “value” of different types isn’t the evil that the leftists would try to indoctrinate you into thinking. I agree with the sentiment of movie production or fashion.  But people, even the socialists who want to own more of people’s’ labor for supposed betterment, like that stuff. Entertainment, storytelling, fashion, these aren’t modern things - they’re ages old. They’re human nature. The fact that there’s so much money in that vs other greater challenges is indeed sad, but it’s humanity’s making, and it’s not going to change.  Best you can do is vote with your wallet and route your resources when you have them, elsewhere. 

The good news is you’re young. You’ll mess up, reset, and carry on.  Just make sure you’re learning and passing on what you learn. ",2020-07-11 15:14:22

I caught a sinus infection about a month ago and called in sick one AM. My boss told me they NEEDED me for a meeting & could I take the next day off. Fine. I came in.

For context: I'm a final year university student who will hopefully be 'graduating' this summer. I'm also currently applying for jobs, which is obviously not ideal in this climate.

I'm not dealing very well mental health wise with the current lockdown. I've got a few final university assignments to do, which I'm struggling to get done, but other than that I don't feel at all able to do... almost anything else. I'm seeking help etc. (I'll save you all the long details!), but I'm barely fulfilling the basic functions of a human being at the moment, let alone learning new skills, taking online courses, or generally working on my personal or professional development.

I'm worried that, over the coming months/year(s) I'm going to be asked about how I used this period to improve myself and make myself a better candidate, and that I'm not really going to be able to say anything. I can say that I was working on my university work, and that I've done a little bit of aid volunteering (it's an ad hoc kind of thing), but I reckon that lots of people feel more able to use this time to do lots of impressive stuff. That's how it feels among my peer group, anyway. I was already less than confident about getting a job after I graduated, but it would really suck if this was another blow.

I just started a new job a couple of months ago and I’m having a hard time fitting in. It’s my first job out of school in a large company in the Midwest (USA) and I moved here from a North Carolina suburb. I am one of the youngest here. 

I’m a very outgoing person and was very excited to come to this position. I love learning about new people as well. I met with all kinds of people, introduced myself, asked them tons of questions, and tried my best to start conversations. 

But that’s not reciprocated. I often don’t get told good morning (I get no one OWES me this but it’s a bummer), I get ignored in meetings, and no one wants to hold a conversation with me about even the most mundane things. My emails get ignored sometimes too even by those within my function. For the email thing, I probably need to earn my place or something, but it’s compounded by all the other things I’ve been experiencing. 

A couple of examples:

My function had a group call and I asked them what they’ve had for breakfast just to fill the pre-meeting silence and got nothing back. Another person came on and they were willing to talk to them about their mundane question. So I didn’t bother saying anything else and it has made me stop going into meetings too early. 

I went to a team building lunch and no one spoke to me despite me asking them questions about themselves and trying to connect on what they’re talking about. At a table of four, I sat with two other new people and one seasoned employee. One new person asked everyone but me what brought them to the company. I asked her but no one reciprocated. Things like that happened throughout the lunch. I just stopped talking.

It’s honestly made me withdraw into myself and kind of killed my desire to be outgoing. I feel very alone and that no one really wants me there or wants to get to know me. I just sit in these meetings, introduce myself and people say “hi” and nothing else. So I’ve kind of stopped trying.

I know it’s important to be strong and hold out, especially in new positions, but I thrive off of team work and some sort of camraderie. 

It’s probably hard to gauge just from a post on reddit but any suggestions on how I can connect with my team and business partners? What sort of things am I doing wrong? What can I do to improve? Maybe I’m just reading into it incorrectly. I don’t know. I honestly feel like maybe the Midwest isn’t for me...",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g1tclo/hardly_anyone_speaks_to_me_at_work_and_im_having/,262,Just be you and don’t try to hard lol ,2020-04-15 14:49:30

My job requires a bachelor's degree and 2 years experience in the field. I was hired with zero experience, zero knowledge of the industry, and an associate's degree. I was referred by a current employee who spoke to my experience in overall business knowledge, customer service, professionalism etc. I learned the entire job in three weeks and now I'm training people. I am generally a very fast learner and did the same thing in other industries. I find a lot of jobs are like this and I'm looking at entering a new industry once again. Wondering what some might be where there are requirements, but if they just met me they would see I have the talent and skills to learn and do the job.

Of course there are many jobs that require specific education, licensing, etc. I would refer to those as skilled professions (doctors/nurses, electrician, etc).

So the question is, what jobs typically have educational/experience requirements that you don't actually need to be good at the job after some training?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ewqipz/name_a_job_that_typically_requires_experience_to/,267,Psychologist ,2020-01-31 16:03:08
124,ge6nbo,False,Advice,23,Has anyone else had their imposter syndrome flair up after not losing a job during layoffs? How have you dealt with it?,careerguidance,"First off I just want to say I am very fortunate, and I am very grateful for still having a job. I don't want to give up because I was given this opportunity so I better make the most of it. Any advice on how to move onward and upward when you're feeling survivors guilt and imposterish, would be very helpful.

The company I work for was just cut exactly in half. In a small company that feels really personal and not to mention we're in a fairly small town where everyone knows everyone. 

I was fairly new, and although I recently was getting over my imposter syndrome for being new and young. It came back full force right after ""mourning"" the loss of co-workers that I admired and that I felt were very hard-working. 

My job hasn't changed much since I am the only person who was doing my particular jobs and I had already been covering for another employee who was often absent for the past year or so. In fact my job has been a lot slower since people were let go.

Because of this I am panicking a little because of the lack of immediate fires to put out. And knowing that other people have massive new fires I was trying to streamline some of our processes to make life easier for others, but I may have frustrated them more. 

I feel guilty for still having my job. I feel guilty for not having a bunch of new responsibilities (yet). I know I have been working hard to make this workplace better and have been pretty well appreciated by management, but I can't help but feel guilty about others who loved their jobs losing them. And I'm feeling unreasonably useless right now. I know better, but I can't help but feel it and I am struggling to power through.

TLDR: I have a job even though our company downsized by half. Im struggling to move forward because I feel guilty and like an imposter. 

Any advice is appreciated, no matter how blunt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ge6nbo/has_anyone_else_had_their_imposter_syndrome_flair/,262,"obviously my name was used for attracting funds from those stupid investors as a start up since i have a sort of rare license in the region. the company put me in a isolated room (warehouse sort of) and leave me alone, literally no workload. imposter syndrome at its peak. the CEO was surprised that i showed up in the office like supposedly i should not. previously there are someone higher up telling me that i can stay home and 'work'. i didnt believe that because it is not black and white, even it is against what had been written in the contracts. its scary they would fire me for any reason or if the funding runs out.

so i am just here studying frontend development. i gonna be fired one day anyway ",2020-05-05 21:31:55
125,gragx1,False,Advice,81,My boss clearly wants me to quit. What now?,careerguidance,"**TLDR:** I adore my job and coworkers, but it's becoming clear that my boss wants me to leave. Instead of firing me during company layoffs, she seems to want to bully me until I quit. There is no HR dept *and* there are no other teams I could transfer to that don't already report to my boss. Is finding another job my only option here?

\----

I've worked for my employer for 4 years and received 1 raise during that time. The job is low-stress and I adore my coworkers, so I stayed. Last year, I tried salary negotiations, which were denied, but the CEO said he wanted to start grooming me for a Director role. I truly enjoyed the company culture, environment, coworkers, and the work that I do, so I stayed on board. However, that promotion never came.

Things went south in March. The company laid off 1/3 of their staff, then turned around and hired a new executive from Silicon Valley two weeks later, which seemed like odd timing. I managed to survive the mass layoffs, but I honestly wish they'd just let me go at that time. Ever since, my direct manager has been increasingly micromanaging me, and it seems she's looking for any excuse at all to fire me. She's giving my projects to others then replacing it with busy work, looking at my personal Google calendar on a daily basis (*not* because she's trying to schedule meetings with me either), and writing emails throwing me under the bus to the CEO. She also requires me to have multiple 1:1 meetings with her per day about the same exact project, and in between meetings she will sometimes send passive-aggressive emails. My favorite one was: ""Hey, are you in the office today or did you take unapproved PTO?"" (I'd already had two meetings *with her* that day, so she knew I was in the office, and I've *never* taken unapproved PTO.)

I'm trying to upward manage my boss and remain professional as much as possible, but it's becoming clear that she's setting me up to fail. During meetings, I've asked her for feedback and asked for specific reasons why she's dissatisfied with my work, but she swears that's not the case... then returns to her passive-aggressive behaviors. I'm so sad because I loved being a part of this company & have great rapport with my colleagues, but I might have to kiss this job goodbye due to this one toxic manager.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gragx1/my_boss_clearly_wants_me_to_quit_what_now/,263,"How high up is this woman that you couldn't just go over her head and start using your social currency at work to get out from under her?

If you communicate to the powers that be this woman is toxic to the work culture, there is a chance they will choose harmony over her bullshit. Even better if other people at the company can attest to her bs.

Document everything you can. Worse comes to worse, your fighting back spurs her to fire you and you get unemployment plus you have a paper trail proving you tried to communicate her issues with you to leadership numerous times. ",2020-05-27 01:50:53

I love to draw, design and write but I only came across drawing in my mid twenties and I’m self taught and although I’m not very good I do enjoy it.

I have never gotten any satisfaction from working, I have simply done it to keep a roof over my head.  I think this is how I fell into bartending in the first place.

I moved across the country at 20 years old (2008 by the way) and realized ""Life is hard when you're the one paying for it""  
Ended up in a bartending job because it was a way to make enough money to pay my bills and have some money left over for the actual enjoyable part of life.

Fast forward 11 years (31 now) and I'm still bartending. Where I'm working pays really well but I swear I'm dying on the inside. 

The problem is that I genuinely don't know how else to make a living out here. I live in CA and I can not reasonably afford to rent a place of my own (51% of my income just to cover the $1700 rent for a studio or maybe 1 bedroom if you're lucky) *with* my good paying bar job, so what else is there?

Am I missing something? Nothing really calls to me for a job, so is this it? Do I just bartend so that I have something to make an income off of for the rest of my life and just kinda die inside? There's no job that's calling to me. Hobbies and passions sure, but they require money to do anyway and you don't get paid to do them. Not as inexperienced as I am either.

140,hhzlwu,False,None,71,is it worth leaving a new job because of really poor leadership?,careerguidance,"Hi! I want to keep this as short as possible. 

I started a new job mid April. Everything was going great for the first month until another employee Karen* came back from covid lockdown. She didn’t like the way I did things and began berating me in front of everyone. I told my boss it made me uncomfortable and he said he would talk to her, but he totally folded, which reinforced her shitty behavior. Knowing he couldn’t help me I just tried to keep my mouth shut and ignore it.

She continued making me uncomfortable (yelling at me when things were wrong but also not training me to do it the “right way” beforehand) and I think another coworker noticed. He told my boss’ boss (the owner) I was overwhelmed and getting no help from Karen*. 

The owner to me in his office to talk. He asked what was going on and I said “I do not feel supported by Karen” to which he said “you are not supported by her.” Um, ok???? Wow love to work on a team that doesn’t support you. He went on to say “look we all hate Karen. She does this to everyone and several people have left bc of her. She causes drama and she does her work wrong half the time. But her bark is worse than her bite, it’s just a social learning curve you have to get used to. Just ignore her.” Um, no???? I work directly next to this woman that shits on everything I do and this is the best you can offer? She is directly ahead of me in the work flow how am I supposed to ignore or avoid her. He then tells me, “you’ll learn I have a fear of firing people. I hired Beth* bc she said she was bitchy enough to put Karen in her place, but now they’re buddies. So I’m hoping you can own that work area and run her out of here.” What the fuck??? Lol 

There are a lot of other hairy details I’m leaving out for the sake of hoping someone will read this. They warned me in the interview there would be drama. Red flag!! I feel like I’m being gaslit at this new job and I just want to quit. Before this I was working as a receptionist (earning only a dollar less than doing skilled labor) and they would take me back in a heartbeat.

*Edit: I just wanna give a big thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts with me, you guys have no idea how much I appreciate it!!*",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f0a33c/what_is_95_office_culture_like_specifically_in/,246,"i worked in an office for 9 months, so i'd say i'm well qualified to answer your questions.

1) most of the people that did this were higher ups and as long as they got their work done, it was all good. sometimes they'd let another higher up that they'd be arriving later than usual, but it really wasn't that big of a deal.

2) i could usually take lunch anytime between 1pm-2pm. sometimes i'd have so much work to do that i'd take lunch past 2pm, but it didn't happen that often. i usually went for lunch at 1pm since it was much closer to 9am, but if i took lunch at 1:30pm or 2pm, it meant the rest of the day felt much shorter than it really was.

3) a lot of the people that were there for much longer than me went out for happy hour or to lunch/dinner, but since i was considered a new guy, i wasn't brought along. we did however have a lot of events in the office. these were usually for holidays or birthdays. people usually talked about whatever they wanted to talk about.

4) people did curse a lot, but it was only when they weren't talking to a customer or to a superior. 

5) i wasn't there long enough to witness any special traditions.

6) reading online reviews and the body language/vibe you get from the office helps a lot. the place i used to work at had open cubicles, so you could easily see everyone all at once. in general, the place was emotionless and it being cold on a near daily basis didn't help.

i'd say working in an office is just like any other job. as long as you keep your eyes, ears, and mouth shut during certain situations, you'll be good. a lot of people thrive on gossiping and stirring shit up, so just be careful of what you say and who you're saying it to. ",2020-02-07 12:54:22
142,ha0fep,False,Advice,93,24 with no work experience and completely lost in life. What should I do?,careerguidance," Hello all, I know this probably gets asked a lot but I felt like I really needed to get some advice. Lately I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks at night while I think about the future. I graduated from university exactly 2 years ago, and I have been unemployed and lost ever since. In college I was initially a business major with plans to specialize in sports business (sports are by far my biggest passion). After taking and struggling with the required classes such as Accounting, I did not meet the requirements to make it into the business school. With my business degree chances evaporated I changed majors and graduated with a more generic economics/business/sociology type degree with a minor in media studies.

As graduation approached I still had no answer to the classic question of “so what are you going to do next?”. I still love sports business but that field seems incredibly cutthroat and unstable. As an introverted guy I would really not fit in with that style of super social and outgoing personality to have success in that field. At this point in my life I feel just completely overwhelmed. The thought of a 9-5 job that I don’t enjoy makes me sick to my stomach just imagining it. My resume is barren and the more time that goes by the worse it will be. I have been studying for an IT certification but have made little progress. It makes me incredibly disappointed in myself that I can’t even get myself to study anymore. After 2 years of doing nothing I feel like I have snuffed out any flame of ambition I once had. I dread holidays and get anxious thinking about how I’m going to answer when family and strangers ask me “what do you do?”.

I know this is more of a rant but I felt like I needed to get some of this off my chest and see if anyone here has battled through a similar period in their life.

My main passions are sports, film, animals/environmental justice, poker (I love game theory and statistics).

Thank you!

He agreed and seemed understanding but I had to stay with finance until a big project I was involved with was done (beginning April). I was happy!

Then pandemic happened... all that big project (the yearly budget) became void and I got furloughed. They were apologetic and I have since filed for unemployment and I’m home waiting to get a call back (and living my best life tbh). However, a good friend who’s a coworker in that accounting department gave his notice two weeks ago, and suggested me reach out to them to try and get back to the accounting department (remember, the CFO back in January promised me). I didn’t and now I found out that the company posted a google ad and on their website that they’re hiring for such position in accounting ON THE DAY MY COWORKER GAVE HIS NOTICE!!!! KILL ME!

However, my job title is quite impressive in the context of my career development over the last decade.

But I simply can't take this anymore. The stress is taking over my life, I've been having nightmares recently about my work. I'm not able to save any money at all... This job is good for my career but bad for my life.

I know I need to find new employment, but to find something that would take advantage of this experience would probably take a while. And I don't have a while, I can't wait anymore I feel like I'm on the edge of something bad if I keep trying to put up with my current situation.

My question is, would I be crazy to quit and take a job that doesn't take advantage of this recent experience? 

To be specific, I know I can get a job working as a front desk attendant at a hotel. It would be much less stressful, I would be full-time so I would have a decent pay, health insurance, vacation time, etc.

But would this derail my career?

Feeling kinda hopeless, got any advice for me?",careerguidance,"I started freelance editing/proofreading about 10 years ago and stuck with it until now due to various family/health issues that prevented me from taking up a 9-5 job. I have 2 incomplete degrees that I abandoned years ago because I didn't need them for freelancing (MA about 90% completed, BA about 50%). 

Now I need a way to support myself and I'm trying to finally set up something that will work for me in the long run. My freelancer profile is probably my best asset with a 100% client satisfaction score and some great written feedback. I never knew it would be so useless when trying to find employment. 

The thing is, I want to quit freelancing. For me, it's always been too much effort for an unbalanced work life and little money. I definitely never enjoyed the constant race for new clients either. Some of this is probably my fault.

I also want to step away from editing. I'm a decent editor, but not some great talent, and I no longer enjoy doing it. This is partly because of the nature of freelancing and partly because I find most of my projects unfulfilling and meaningless. I did have some good, long-term clients, but not enough to be able to refuse crappy ones.

My aim is to establish a simple, ""normal"" adult life with a job that pays the bills and has fixed work hours. At this point, I don't even care if it's boring, I just want to be financially balanced, not having to work (chase new clients) to be able to work, and have a couple of hours to myself after I've finished work.

But I'm not sure it's possible to make this transition without solid work experience and education on my resume. I'm worried that I'm too old, my work experience is not enough, and generally not sure how to go about it. 

Do you have any advice for me? Courses I should take that would make me marketable in a short period of time?

I'm actually not some lowlife, I just need someone to give me a break. I work hard, learn fast, and I'm responsible. I've always worked remotely and would like to keep it that way. I was looking at jobs like content moderation and customer support roles where they don't necessarily ask for relevant experience. But there might be other options, I just really never learned how to do a proper job search. Any advice is appreciated!

If time and money permit, I would seriously consider going back and finishing both of them then combine those with your proofreading/editing experience and BOOM!

I’m 32 and had a stroke November last year, which took away my speech. I had to relearn how to speak starting with the abc. Today marks five months since my stoke and I have recovered roughly 75%. I still find it difficult to get out some complex words, joining words (like ‘and’ and ‘an’), and my sentences sometimes have slight gaps between words. Sometimes I speak perfectly, but I’m slower than I once was but I’m getting there! They say it’s takes several months to a year to heal the brain after a stoke. I’m have youth on my side. 

Before I had my stroke, I was travelling the world for six months. I got made redundant in March 2019 from my finance role, where I analysed companies (shares) and the economy for a living for six years writing a newsletter for a global publishing company. All up I have roughly 7-8 year experience in the financial industry. But I wasn’t able to break into a big fund or broking firm, so I was severely underpaid (~$80k) by industry standards of $150k+. But I have the interesting and competitive experience for finance, I guess.

My concern is that I have over a years gap on my CV....now with the corona virus and businesses not advertising for jobs. Then again, if this event didn’t happen, I still wouldn’t feel ready because of my speech - it will be hard to sell myself now. I’m thinking of giving myself until the end of the year to hopefully recover, and, by then hopefully the economy will be reopened and companies hiring again. 

To cut a long story short, I’ll probably be out of the work force for nearly 2 years because of my stroke and the economic shutdown before I apply to jobs...if I start applying at the start of next year. 

I have always wanted to give tech sales a crack, but that depends obviously on my speech and how much it recovers - I’ll need to sell myself to land a job and I can only do that if I’m 99% better. I feel hopeful about it though. But I don’t know what I will look like in 3-6 months. If not, I will probably go back into finance becuase I’ll have no choice.

After graduating from college I wasn’t getting anywhere due to lack of experience.  I somehow lucked into my current job at an early stage startup where I got given a chance. My boss (CEO) seemed nice and friendly, and first few weeks seemed fine enough that I thought this could be a place I could grow into. We had lunches together and talked about the kind of work to be done and expectations of support I will need.

But then suddenly, my boss’s attitude changed and he started swearing a lot and becoming abusive. I think this coincided with the CTO resigning. So because we became short staffed, my boss started throwing work at me which I was completely unqualified for. He also casually blackmails me saying “he’ll destroy my career if I don’t deliver on my work” or “ruin my life in ways I haven’t even thought of”. After I barely manage to scrape through a deliverable, he suddenly becomes friendly again. 

For my next deliverable, I’ve already been sent work to do over the weekend and honestly I am completely out of my depth... I would normally do as I am told, but the fact is, I am too slow.

158,hrptg7,False,Portugal (Europe),37,I have made a huge mistake and switched to a new company mid-pandemic. I hate it. What should I do?,careerguidance,"A few months ago I was contacted by a head hunter for a job with a much higher salary in a very prominente company, better benefits and lots of flexibility.  
At this point, I was employed for 2,5 years in a fairly good company, which had its problems, but I could deal with them. They didn't pay very well, though, but I had lots of flexibility, a great team and super interesting projects.  
At the same time I was contacted by this head hunter, I was going through the selection process to my dream job and I had made it until the last phase where it was just me or another person.    
So, I had 2 very good opportunities on the table: my dream job and the other job which was better. I decided it was safe to quit.  
As you may imagine, I was not selected for my dream job. So I was left with a very good job offer, which was ok for me. I took it and here I am, 2 months later.  
My mistake was that I was so convinced I was going to get the dream job that I didn't pay attention to the signs in my interactions with my current employer that this was bad, nor did I dedicate any effort to get to know a bit more of the company.   
This new company is absolutely the worst. They literally lied in the interviews about the company’s working culture, their stance about flexibility and even about some aspects of my contract.  
I got in the company in the middle of a HUGE crisis where I immediately took a ton of responsibility and I felt it would not be correct for my colleagues if I quit during my experience period and leave them with all of this by themselves. 2 of them are really great, one of them actually quit last week. The company has a huge turnover, as you can imagine.  
I am finding out more and more horrific things about this company every day. My boss is a hypocrite, liar, has no empathy, treats women poorly, and everything revolves around him and how brilliant he is. Overall a sick narcissist. Last year alone, 2 people had burnouts and 1 had a stroke after working 4 days without sleeping.  
I worked 2 national holidays and 1 full weekend, plus a million extra hours for an event, which I would not do in a normal situation, but everything was very badly managed and if I didn’t, nothing would work. The day after the event I was told we could take one day off (which is not enough either way), so I took it, but apparently it just meant that instead of arriving at 9:30 I could arrive at 10:00. And this is not even a joke or me exaggerating.  
I’m not going to rant anymore, but many other very horrible things have happened and I honestly don’t know what to do. There should be an economic crisis coming up and I’m not sure I can just quit without anything lined-up. I don’t want to be unemployed when it hits. I have applied to 3 jobs so far that I’m waiting for an answer. 1 of them with people I know and who really appreciate my job, another one for a position that I’m 100% qualified, and another one that actually I will not take at all even if I’m selected because it is not very interesting.

I’m 22 and I’m currently finishing my Bachelor in Business Information Technology. I hate it. I’m thinking about studying a postgraduate degree that will help me change this career before I even started it. The only reason I continued in this career is because of my family and their pressure, dumb move, I know. Anyway I don’t even know what I want to switch into, but this whole business thing feels so superficial, and not me. I like helping people, providing people with the chance to change their lives, guiding troubled people, especially youth. I want to make a difference in this world. I consider myself to be a very smart person, I did extremely well in school, in every subject. I did IB and I was good at math, at chemistry, at biology, at English, history. I’m good at language and research, I learn quickly. I’m creative, I love art and design and that was my passion for a while until I was crushed by the reality of that industry having no money. I’m an INFP if that helps? I’m bilingual, I’m interested in culture and travel and politics and social justice. I don’t know if any of this is even relevant but if anyone has any ideas, any guidance, on a field I can pursue that I may have not considered, please please please just comment it. I’ve considered social work, psychology, law. I’m afraid of the job prospectives of those things, I don’t want to be broke and unemployed. Throughout my university life I’ve worked in data entry, social media marketing and retail just to make some money and get some experience. I did well at them but I just didn’t feel happy working so hard just to increase the profit of a company who didn’t care about anyone. I’m so lost and I just hope that someone has some advice to offer. Anyone who’s been through a similar experience. I’m not asking for anyone to solve all my life issues and lay out a plan, I’m just looking for some insight.

It's worth it to take a little time to think about what you want to do, what kind of people you want to work with and in what setting.  There are a lot of books on this.  

The Myers Briggs type tests can help give some insight so you could search on ""INFP careers"".   I think this site might also be helpful: [https://www.careerexplorer.com](https://www.careerexplorer.com).  My guess is you would be happier in things like social work / psychology / nonprofit than in finance / sales / marketing type jobs.

As for money, probably if you stuck with social media marketing or business technology you could make a lot of money, but that doesn't mean you would be poor in helping professions like psychology / social work / nonprofit.  I know several people who are social workers or therapists that do quite well for themselves.   For those positions you're going to need graduate degrees and probably licenses.  I also know people that have been involved in nonprofits or ""corporate giving"" positions that have good (though not spectacular) salaries.

Since you're still in school take advantage of any academic and career advisors who can help you find direction.  I didn't do that much, had no clear career plan, and when I graduated floundered around for years.  So don't make that mistake.  Get on it .  There's still time. ",2020-06-06 14:05:49

163,fvy2vt,False,Coworkers,74,How can I make my boss understand how overworked I am?,careerguidance,"Basically, I'm the team lead and in charge of supervising two junior team members, so I have all of their responsibilities plus a heap of other responsibilities on top of them - including managing those team members. Despite this, I've been repeatedly chewed out by my boss because the junior team members complete more of a few specific kind of tasks than I do in a shift.

To me this seems ridiculous. It's like asking a manager of a coffee shop why they aren't making as many cups of coffee as the baristas. During shifts I'm the sole go-to person for people from other departments (there's a lot of back and forth) and in charge of overseeing operations, and deciding which tasks are priorities and which aren't, and doing final QC checks. Even to get all of that done I usually end up working 10-12 hour days, and it's still not enough.

My boss just won't listen when I explain how overworked I am. He has very specific ideas about how long certain tasks ""should"" take, right down to the second. He's mapped out my shifts according to these increments of time that he's decided constitute how long each task should take and it all adds up to 8 hours, therefore he thinks there shouldn't be a problem. There's no accounting for the fact that switching tasks every few minutes makes a dent in focus and productivity.

For example, one of the tasks that he's tacked onto my job is running social media. I'm supposed to post to Twitter 30 times a day with accompanying images, gifs etc. and he says that this should be easy because ""it only takes a few seconds."" But crafting a tweet that's witty and engaging and corporate-friendly takes more than just a few seconds, and interrupting my day to do it 30 times is really disruptive.

With everything that I'm expected to do, mistakes are inevitably made and things slip through the cracks. I've been reprimanded for mistakes many times and every single time I tell him the same thing: I have too much stuff to do. And nothing changes. If anything, more work just gets added to the list.

Every day there's a new fire. This is beyond crisis communication -  that's different, I don't do that. This is like, ""we need a campaign on  XYZ in three days including radio, tv, print, billboards, social media,  etc etc etc,"" which they will then forget about the next week and that campaign just fizzles and dies.

For whatever reason, it seems like that allows older professors to speak disrespectfully to me in front of my students, whom I expect respect from. When they see co-workers disrespecting me, how are they supposed to have any respect for me? Twice in a row I've had other professors barge in my class and tell me to turn down the volume of the video clip we're watching because it was distracting their class next door. Yet both times, they refused to close their classroom doors and always blasted the volume to their videos so loud our classroom could hear it very clearly while I was instructing. My students remarked at the hypocrisy of the instructor to make such a request. 

Today I had an older professor come into my classroom that she normally uses and exclaim, ""Who are YOU?"" in front of my students during class.

This is also the second time another professor has addressed me like that in front of my students. Her tone was irritated and upset, and I found that to be highly inappropriate. 

I honestly don't know how to address these issues. I'm very cordial and put on a smile and gladly answer, pretending as if I'm not miffed at all. But I don't feel I should be treated this way.

It doesn’t necessarily hold me back professionally, such as I still make and exceed my sales goals, I am very quick to learn new skills, I am patient and calm with clients and can turn around a bad situation by being nice and “sweet”

But it does hold me back in the social aspect of my business life. Some example of this are I have trouble networking and making connections. I don’t make friends easily at the office (6 months in I’m loved by everyone, but up until then I get a lot of heat. They don’t understand why the quiet girl is doing so well and the loud people are just doing ok). I once had a boss call a meeting with me just tell me the thing she hated about me most was that I was shy. I asked her if she thought I wasn’t doing my work well, she said it was all great but she didn’t like that I wasn’t loud and chatty like her. I could understand if a client said something, but I didn’t work with clients at that point, I did research for her. 

I learn by listening and observing, then trying and then asking questions along the way. I’ve had employers tell me that if I’m not asking questions while learning, I’m not paying attention.

She started with the company in 2010 at $30 an hour. It's been 10 years and they never offered her a raise. Not once. Nothing. She recently asked for a raise and they offered her a measly dollar. The problem is wages in the private sector are right around $25-$30 an hour for my state.

Is this a problem with the company or just the economy in general? I feel like going 10 years without even a small raise to compensate for inflation is just god awful for a company to do to an employee.

I am currently paying my minimum on my loans among numerous other expenses, I am in no position to just quit until I am able to find a new career.

I graduated a year ago ( Dec '19) from an above-average business program, with a degree in logistics and supply chain. I was quite active, through my fraternity and the supply chain club. My grades were good (3.4) and I am was also able to graduate a year early due to workload and credits from HS.

I look great on paper, I am even better IRL. Not too gloat but I am currently among the top 5 trainees in my current company ( 500+) in sales, but I just have no interest in working there and would leave at the drop of a hat.

However, my job search is horrid, like worse than Season 8 of GOT. I have only been applying to supply chain/logistics field positions. For the most part its been assistants or entry-level positions, and a few higher-level positions for giggles. But its been three weeks now and I have not gotten a single reply, not even a rejection letter.

I have already submitted my resume to r/Resume for help and even used a website to generate a resume.

What I am asking is should I continue busting my chops at my current company or should I leave and work a part-time position and focus solely on finding a better career?

Also if anyone has been in this position, I could really use some advice as I am freshly turned 22 years old just trying to enjoy my early twenties while also being able to pay off some of this ever-increasing debt...

Fiancé: 32
Psycho bitch: mid-late 30s

Recently my boyfriend/FI popped the question after a year together! We work at the same company but he’s in a different office an hour away. 

About a week after that I got a work email at 3AM from some bitch (PB) in his office. Claimed they’d been dating for 5 years, he’s the father of her 9 y/o daughter, how could I sleep at night destroying a family, I don’t need a husband when I have a good job, and if I could get a white man why did I need to “take a good Black man.” She threatened to go to my supervisor that I was “fraternizing at work”. 

I emailed her back, “Don’t ever contact me again; and do your career a favor and keep made-up personal drama off your work server.” 

Both FI & several friends at his office confirmed FI’s story - he took her out once 5 years ago for workday lunch while PB was going through a divorce.  (I knew this before we got together) Also a friend sent me some screenshots of FB - PB and her daughter are the whitest people ever. Turns out the little girl’s dad knows my parents and is a good guy.  

In other words PB built a lot up in her mind & people have been working to make her understand it’s not true; they were never in a relationship. 

I went to PB’s supervisor; she got written up & had to attend sensitivity training or something. 

My supervisor wasn’t delighted that I was dating someone at the company, especially since FI and I (and 150-some others) roll up to the same VP. He said that going to the supervisor was unnecessary and that I needed to “hide (my) disdain for single moms better.”  He was unable to provide specifics. 

I just learned that the other night PB went on some bender and sent out a bunch of unhinged messages to coworkers about me ruining her and her daughters life before attempting suicide (in front of the girl). I’m horrified she got to that point, but also furious she brought my name into it.

I’m currently getting my degree in Marketing and slowly have been getting into that industry for the past 4 years. My track record has shown that I keep accepting job offers that promise opportunities that never seem to come to fruition. 

When I first decided to switch to marketing (bc I couldn’t find any decent paying jobs in graphic design in my area) I took a job in marketing at a small (but had a huge client list across the country) business that promise I would be working & gaining experience in marketing. They wanted someone fresh because they never really had a designated marketing person and it would be a great growing experience for both of us. They were the ones who got me back in school for marketing. I stayed there a little over 3 years and ended up only really ever doing graphic design with minimal raises, barely any marketing experience, and no promotions. I eventually left that company when they opened a new position in marketing & never considered me for the position (even though this would have been GREAT marketing experience for me and i expressed interest in the position) to give it to someone outside the company that eventually came out she had no idea what she was doing. 

I had another dumb job that didn’t even last a year and now I’m at my current job.

My role for the first year has consisted of Project Manager, Designer, and Foreman actually working in the field on a couple of projects due to staff constraints. Before I joined, the company’s revenue was around 500-600k. This year, the company revenue will total 800-850k. We couldn’t produce any more work than that because there aren’t enough skilled employees, and frankly the existing employees are pretty awful (lazy, bare minimum, can’t wait to be laid off, etc.).

The company owner tried for over a year to hire a designer/manager to take over for him as he wants to move toward retirement, and I don’t think he expected me to basically take over the entirety of design/sales and crew management in the first year. My potential is limited by the size of the company and lack of skilled and motivated staff. I am confident that I could sell over 2 million in projects per year for a company that can handle that volume of work. 

I was hired in at 65k per year based on the first year sales of 200k (owner saw the first year as a transition phase for him getting out of design/sales so he took a small pay cut). I’ve sold 1.1 million, but the company literally can’t produce that amount of work in a single year, so how do I go about a hefty salary negotiation since I’m basically driving the whole damn ship for the owner? There are other companies 1-2 hours away from my current city hiring design/sales positions with salaries and great benefit packages well over 100-120k, which I feel I could absolutely achieve. 

I’m not sure what the best move is for me career wise.

Anyways, the manager treats me like crap most of the time, our boss can also be horrible and demands the best quality of work with the shortest amount of time possible (so working OT/working over weekends) and if you don't deliver, you're just not good enough for their company. My manager has honestly been horrible to me, even the staff in different departments commented on how he speaks to me.

My notice period is a month, and I know for a fact he's going to be so horrible when I tell him I will be moving to a different company (sort of a competitor too), and I'm just not willing to sit through for a month of hell. He's currently been nice because one of our ex assistant had left a horrible glassdoor review of working for the company.

At first, I really liked this job because my team in digital marketing was really great and fun and I got to learn a lot. But one problem is that our management (CEO, VPS etc) are super disorganized. Like has no clear vision of what they want, gives super vague instructions and indecisive on the output, gives us tasks without any working materials or assets and gets mad when the results aren't skyrocketing. The DM team itself is also fairly new (around a year).

Before, I could bear it cus I liked our team lead and the process but since the pandemic hit, they've pretty much wave after wave of lay offs because we weren't showing results/cost cutting (we work with international students so that's important to know). I was spared because: 1. I was the only writer they had at the time for both operations and marketing, 2. the only one who didnt quit, 3. the only one who could work in a fast-paced environment.

Right now though, I'm starting to really hate it here. Management is still super disorganized and has no direction, the new marketing head doesnt communicate anything and just tells me to do this and that so I have no idea what the direction of our marketing is supposed to go, work hours are spilling over to my free time, and the new 'senior writer and communications specialist' they hired is super rude and mean. Like he just barks orders and tells me to do the stuff he was assigned to do (like simply telling the devs or designers to make this web page etc).

I was gonna suck it up until the end of the virus at least but something our new video editor said struck me. He said he wondered why they needed a new guy who doesnt know the brand of the company or know where to get the materials be the lead coordinator/project manager when the end result is that people turn to me to ask for those stuff anyway. And why they couldnt have just promoted me to senior and hired someone in my place. And like I dont wanna brag but I've been doing really good and have become familiar with all these things so I was thinking maybe he has a point.

So on top of feeling overworked, underpaid, and dissatisfied, I have to add underappreciated too haha. So I'm just tempted to quit now even without a new job lined up since my freelance clients rn can meet my salary anyway and I have enough emergency funds for like a year.

Be assertive, and propose solutions / plans instead of complaining there isn't one and you can quickly rise in chaotic companies.  Sit around and complain that it's disorganized and you'll miss those opportunities.

A failure in the upper levels is an opportunity to rise.  You rise by solving the problem, not pointing out the problem.

My husband stuggled through college, but he made it, graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. The problem was his final GPA was a 2.5 (lots of events happened that lead to the final number. No excuses being made here though).

No entry level mechanical engineering jobs would even interview him, siting his GPA was too low. Fast forward a few years and he’s had a job as a auto cad drafter & auto cad tech. We thought, ok he has some job experience, let’s try applying to low level jobs at the engineering firms. Maybe now the GPA won’t be an issue.

He applied to a hiring event at an engineering firm. His sister knew the guy running the event, he spoke with him before the event and heard they were desperate to get people in. He wasn’t even allowed into the hiring event because his GPA is a mandatory field and they automatically kick out anything lower than a 3.0.

Does this mean his GPA will always keep him from becoming a mechanical engineer? How do you get a foot in the door to even be interviewed if places don’t even look at your experience because of GPA? Should he be thinking of a new career path?

I'm a 22 year old male from the USA about to graduate with a degree in Software Engineering (Computer Science) in 2021. I had an internship and honestly it was the perfect job for someone going into my field, it was fun, exciting, and hands on.

I just don't feel any type of reward from working hourly paid jobs, maybe because I don't feel the direct impact of what I am doing, plus I hate belonging to a big group.

I noticed I am much more productive when I'm not following other peoples orders. For example, over the breaks I would sometimes do unassigned projects on my own, then when the next semester would start a professor would assign something similar and I would end up procrastinating and barely submit it on time while I had already completed something similar. I also work as a freelance mobile mechanic and do heavy research on the vehicles that I fix and I have a lot of enjoyment working on their cars.

In my life I had worked 12 different jobs (construction, software internships, mechanic engineering internships, Retail, etc.) and I would always think cynical thoughts to cripple the companies.

I'm currently deciding whether to just graduate and finish my degree in Software Engineering, then apply for dental school and eventually open my own practice.

My dream in life is to work less than half the year in the States, and spend the rest of the year in a Latin American country with the money I saved up working in the USA. Basically make 40k in 6 months then live in Central America for the other 6 and repeat this process.

I will try and summarize my opinion based on everyone's responses in this comment.

**SE Freelancing:** I love this idea, but is it realistic to do in a developing country, and if anyone has experience with it please let me know

**Teaching abroad:** Teaching abroad does sound nice, but it eliminates the benefit of being able to have my own freedom to vacation. The other major downside is the pay, because one great thing of working in the US is the currency exchange in other countries.

**Startups:** This is one of my favorite ideas and I have never thought of doing this yet, I love the idea of being part of something small and making it grow. Dealing with the business behind it does excite me. This idea is really giving me passion to code and enjoy my studies again. Even if it the company does fail or go under I will still be able to get back on my feet fairly easy due to Software Engineers being needed.The one downside and the thing that makes me feel selfish for saying, is that I wouldn't be able to to just pickup and leave to another country when I wanted to.

I didn't fully mention the importance of leaving to a developing country. I want to live in one not only because I love the simplistic lifestyle, but I also because the money I would make here in the US goes much further. In a country such as Guatemala a 10k salary would be more than enough for a person to live comfortably and plane tickets are fairly inexpensive too. I feel that it is almost a loophole in life to use it as an economic advantage. I might get a little sting for saying something a bit selfish, but I've met many people from such countries that would travel to the USA to work then send money back home to their families then return after they had saved enough.

Today she sent an email to myself, my manager, and a couple of other coworkers that I work closely with. It included a list of “best practices” when onboarding our clients and said she was excited to teach me how to do so. Again, this is a job I’ve been doing for 3 years and have never received a complaint about my quality of work. The kicker about this email is that she also felt the need to copy and paste our job description into it.  I spoke with a coworker that was also on the email to see if I had missed something and to find out why this email was even sent, and that coworker confirmed that I have not had any missteps in these areas so the email seems very out of the blue. 

There have also been a couple of instances where she checks in to make sure I’ve done things on my accounts that she is not involved in. Every time she asks these questions the answer is yes, I have done it, but she continues to go out of her way to make sure I’m doing my job.  It’s out of character for members of our team to check that other teammates are completing work properly, (whether that’s right or wrong for our organization I’m unsure) I can’t imagine ever doing this to another member of my team. It feels like she’s stepping on my toes but I don’t want to seem ungrateful if she truly is trying to help.

Is this what it's actually used for? I'd prefer from actual hiring managers and hr but i'm open to all opinions. I have never thought about it that way, I just have it to connect with people and keep a network open.

I review resumes, and if I'm getting ready to move someone onto the interview list, I look them up on facebook/linkedin. I'm looking for red flags like differences between their resume and linkedin.

For facebook, I'm looking at thinks like how you communicate. Do you speak clear proper english? Do you speak in slang? Do you use punctuation and proper spelling? 

Lastly, I'm looking at recent posts and pictures. This gives me a snapshot of your personality. Are you a party animal? Is your profile pic a pot leaf? Are you constantly arguing with people about politics or drama? It's such a good way to weed out terrible candidates.

What are my options?",careerguidance," I'm turning 30 in a few months and don't really have anything to show for it. Since I was about five years old I've been 'the computer guy' to my family and friends, and while I've had other interests along the way, most have been for fun and not necessarily something I could make a profit off of, or make into a lifestyle. I've been swapping parts and making upgrades since before I was allowed to use the stove. In the past I've been steered back into tech whenever I decide on a whim to do something differently, because according to my friends, my folks, my family, etc, ""you have an innate knowledge for how machines work, and you're very socially awkward, so tech is perfect for you"".

I went to college for Computer Science, and my professors told me I wasn't cut out for it. I figured, that's nonsense, I'm the computer guy, if I work hard enough and believe I can do it I can be a success story just like every other success story I've read about. Turns out the real world doesn't work that way, and I was transferred to the 'web and game design' major. They didn't want me in that department either but I managed to stick it out. I took a ton of unrelated electives to bring up my GPA enough to stay in school (I don't regret that because I got to take some very cool classes), and I eventually graduated with a very poor major GPA (and a great non-major GPA) and have worked a bunch of Geek Squad/Apple Store/helpdesk related jobs, and a smattering of retail/food service jobs as well.

I've done countless hours of research on how to become a software engineer or IT professional. If I had to guess I'd say somewhere around 12000-18000 hours. Researching bootcamps, languages, putting together websites, doing FreeCodeCamp, going to tech nights and hackathons, it's been a ride for sure. I signed up for HackReactor, Thinkful, AppAcademy, Operation Spark, they all told me I don't have the knack but I kept trying, figuring eventually it'd all click and at that point the pieces would just fall into place. A little while ago I decided I'd make one final effort to make this happen, I enrolled in college for my second Bachelors at a 'go at your own pace' college, this time in Computer Science, and somehow this time I've been able to stick with the program, though I'm much slower than my peers and on average it takes me twice as long to finish courses.

Well, six months into the program and I'm slowly beginning to realize that the reason I've never really been able to 'get it' is that I genuinely hate working with computers, and that scares the hell out of me. In the past few weeks I've found myself doing all the household chores I normally can't stand to procrastinate having to write code/study. I sit down, scroll up and down my 'notes' page a couple times, and say ""you know, I don't think the shower has been re-grouted in a while, better get on that"". My entire identity, for the past 24+ years, has been based on the idea that at some point I'll be some big shot tech guy. I literally have no other skills.

I feel like I've put all of my eggs (and at this point, enough money to buy a small home) into being 'the computer guy' and if I'm not that, I'm literally starting over from scratch. Technically starting from pre-scratch, because I honestly have no idea what else is out there. People online always say ""start with what you like"" but in my case I have no idea what I like because I've never tried anything else. I know I can't join the military, or go into the trades, because I'm moderately disabled (both mentally and physically).

A little about what me and what I'm ultimately looking for:

I have 5 years of experience in management and logistic roles, one for a car manufacturer, the other for a major cell phone provider. I was part of a major lay off in January 2019, rode out my severance for a long time, but now the funds are running dry, and I am still getting nowhere with job applications. I've had my resume critiqued online and in person, and everyone says it is great, so I'm not totally sure why I am not getting any calls for interviews.

Since my main experience is in management, both retail and logistics, I've applied to a number of positions within Amazon, FedEx, UPS, corporate retail store locations, but I feel like my resume and application is mostly just going into the ""void"" as I call it, where it seems like maybe there is a fair bit of luck in getting seen. The other problem is, I haven't really had to job search for a long time in my life, since I graduated college essentially, so I'm about 8 years out of it. I've updated my resume, signed up for Indeed/LinkedIn/etc, but still feeling stuck. 

The past year I've had my hopes and dreams set on opening a business (bar/tavern/brewery), but I'm realizing I just don't have enough money unfortunately, even after working with the SBA and other organizations.

So where I'm at now is a dwindling bank account, and possibly needing to liquidate my 401k ~$26,000 to keep going until I find the right work that covers my expenses, and ultimately is something that is rewarding for me, aka I don't want to just work another dead end job through my 30s.

What I'm wondering now is, should I find a headhunter that maybe has connections in companies so I get noticed more? I'm in a city with lots of young professionals, so I'm feeling maybe my resume is lost in the void as I said earlier. Or do I need to find a new approach to applying for jobs in the even more internet age? Do I need a career shift? I've always thought CS/coding jobs sound great, especially with the high pay. I've looked into coding bootcamps, but for every positive I've seen about them, I've read equally negative things or how they aren't needed.

It was taking a toll on me but I decided to try my best because it was an extremely well known company. On top of it, coworkers abused me on the internal chat and my manager didn’t pay any heed to it. However, the work culture is pretty well known to be harsh and cutthroat. I didn’t realise it was that bad before I joined.

252,c70fro,False,None,162,I've permanently ruined my life. What jobs can actually pay for cheap rent?,careerguidance,"I need more than 15 dollars an hour to pay rent off a 70 hour work week. Grubhub just cut our pay by 25%... again, bringing their pay in line with others like Uber. so im making 10 an hour. Honestly, 100 hours a week is unsustainable. 

Ok, information you need: I have a low IQ, the time i got a driving job at Jimmy johns it took me weeks to learn the menu which is supposed to be memorized before the first day; 

I worked two days outdoor manual labor but had severe cramps from dehydration and almost legit died. I actually enjoyed carrying around 100+ lb boxes in a warehouse freezer but that was 7.50 an hour. Not afraid of manual labor, just can't be outside in the heat;

 I have aspergers, so i REALLY suck at sales, passing interviews, customer service and such like; 

I have 130 college hours, but this does not include any third and fourth year courses because i failed them all. On paper im two years away from graduating, the reality is it's not going to happen;

 I have a cdl, this may be misleading to you. So i drove a truck for a year on a team, which is two drivers per truck, truck runs 24/7. On a team they pay both drivers the rate of the most experienced. So at the top of their pay scale i made 32 thousand that year typically working 6 hours more per week than is legal. Home daily trucking jobs are 12 to 14 per hour 2 years experience, no exceptions. The 32k job was listed as up to 75k on indeed just for context. Yes i can get paid 100k as a trucker if i buy a truck from them, but after payments and maintenance it works out to 50k per year for ten years! The super awesome part of this deal is that you can't drive a 3 year old truck for most trucking companies, so you have to give the truck back and lose all the payments you made. ""Welcome to American! Right this way, please spread your ass cheeks for your convenience sir!"" And im constantly seeing titles like ""Trucking companies can't understand why MilLeNialS refuse to work for them"". Well... it's because the pay is worse than cleaning toilets for McDonald's; 



and finally because ive been working as an independent contractor for the last three years most companies consider me to have been jobless for three years, even though ive been working 70 hours a week.



 STOP READING HERE! IM JUST ADDING CONTEXT. 



So my McDonalds interview is typical of how an interview works. They only hire ""Positive"" individuals, i don't understand what that means, but i came in with a big smile on my face and was yes sir yes maam the entire time. And of course i didn't get the job even with my one year Jimmy johns experience. Aspergers is like having a tattoo on your face, it doesn't matter how hard you try everyone knows their not supposed to hire you. 

The worst part about all of this is my parents disappointment. They cut all the job adds out if the news paper and ask me why im not applying anywhere. I used to say that i couldn't get an interview, but then my parents tell me to just go there in person. Every time ive gone somewhere in person ive been told they only do online applications. Now days i don't tell my parents how my job hunt is going. Real talk, ive counted the businesses in my (one of the top ten largest citys in the US) for different industries, and im legit running out of places to be rejected by. If i could get a job with even a glimmer of hope that i would be able to live a decent life. I would work 120 hours a week at literal running speed. I can make an assembly robot look lazy.  

 Hard work means nothing in America, this is purely an IQ economy and social IQ is the only IQ that matters. TLDR: Nobody is hiring aspergers, nobody, no exceptions, period.

254,fjvtjv,False,None,58,25 and my career is RUINED. How do I get it back on track?,careerguidance,"Hey everyone! I need some help. I am a 25-year-old college grad, trying to pursue a career in marketing/ media. However, due to a series of setbacks (some of them my fault, others not so much), my resume is terrible. It's basically a collection of short-term jobs, all of which have had really terrible endings...which is also an issue because it makes me uncomfortable using references. My work history is riddled with gaps, as well.

I feel like I'm in a hole, and don't know how to get my career back on track. I have so many resume gaps, and haven't even had one job for an entire year yet. I really want to start working on my professional goals, but feel as though a couple wrong moves that I made immediately after graduating have set the tone for my career moving forward- and it's very far from the one I wanted.

***Please note:*** *While grad school would be a good solution, I cannot afford it and even if I could, I've missed the deadlines for several schools with ""mandatory summer starts""; meaning I'd have to wait until summer 2021 to start, which isn't an option.*

Here is a **timeline of my professional life since graduation**.

**Background:** 

\-Graduated in 2017 with a major in Media Studies (focused in Advertising) and minors in both Marketing and Creative Writing. 

\-Had a few great internship opportunities, while still in school- one with a major media company (wound up not working out because I lived in Virginia and couldn't get to Los Angeles in the time span they gave me), and the other was a remote internship with a large online magazine, which I completed.

\-Graduated with honors, 3.3 Cumulative GPA and 3.6 Major GPA.

\-Was in long-term relationship (nearly 5 years) with guy whose graduation was pushed back a year, due to changing majors- meaning, he was staying in the college town and I would be too, seeing as we'd been living together for years.

**Timeline:**

***May 2017-*** Graduated

***Summer 2017-*** Worked at marketing internship w/ large restaurant chain in college town, in order to stay with boyfriend. 

***Fall 2017-*** Took a call center job, in order to make money while job hunting. Still doing this to stay with boyfriend. *Stupid decision.*

***December 2017-*** Could not find job. Got cheated on. Wound up quitting call center job, breaking up with boyfriend, and moving back in with parents.

***Winter 2018-*** Applied for full-time jobs, while working as a ""temp"" secretary (with some unofficial marketing work) at a real estate company, through a staffing agency.

***Spring 2018-*** Could not find a full-time marketing job, with so little experience. Was offered a full-time job with Real Estate company, a.k.a. ""buyout"" from staffing agency, so I would be an official employee, not a temp. Promised marketing/social media responsibilities. Decided to pursue this. Even submitted application and deposit for company-owned apartment next to office.

***May 2018-*** One manager turned out to be mentally unhinged. Stole my $250 deposit for the apartment, stole my SSN, and more. Upper management knew she had done this for days before reporting it to me. (Long story). I quit the job.

***June 2018-*** Got together with new boyfriend. Applied for marketing jobs, but was unsuccessful. Temp agency stopped working with me because I had called the authorities on my former employer for stealing from me. Basically said that their business w/ the company was more important than me.

***July 2018-*** Boyfriend got job with large tech company in Silicon Valley. I had always wanted to go to California and so had he, so we decided to take a leap of faith and go, despite me not having a job lined up. Stupid decision.

***August 2018-*** Moved to Cali. Had been applying and still was. No responses.

***Fall 2018-*** Job hunt unsuccessful. Even fast food places weren't hiring. Too many people, not enough jobs. Did not have a car, which lowered the radius I could travel and hurt my chances further. Went into crushing debt.

***Winter 2018-*** Went home alone for a month or so, to get my finances back under control. Applied for jobs.

***January 2019-*** Received job offer from startup in Silicon Valley. Accepted offer and returned to boyfriend in California.

***Winter/Spring 2019-*** Worked my a\*\* off for company, barely making anything ($20/hr in San Fran- no time and a half for overtime, which happened a lot). Started to notice some shifty things about them- paying me through Venmo-like app, no incoming revenue, etc. 

***May 2019-*** Found out from people ""working for us"" that they were being tricked into free labor. Tried to talk to employer to fix this and make company legitimate, but was shut down. Started applying for other jobs.

***Early July 2019-*** Startup tanking. People quitting left and right. Mental health rapidly declining. Received offer for a job a few states away, so I quit and moved with my boyfriend.

***Late July 2019-*** Got to new city after a long road trip. Called new employer to verify address and start time for first day that Monday. Found out that they had decided to hire an internal candidate at the last minute, and I was never informed. At this point, I'm in a new city and I'm homeless and unemployed.

***August 2019-*** Started working with local temp agency. Got good Marketing gig. Pay was low, but it was work. The contract was for one month, but they were planning on hiring me full-time after it ran out. Even had me write out a list of things I needed for the Marketing department for upcoming year, in order to get them approved during budget meetings. They were approved.

***September 2019-*** Received a phone call on one month anniversary of starting job. It was the temp agency. They said the company couldn't afford to hire me, so they were taking me off the position immediately and would find something else for me. I was devastated, but had no say. Contract said company couldn't work directly with me for a year after contract ended.

***Fall 2019-*** Temp agency could not find anything and basically ghosted. Unemployed, except for an odd job here or there. Broke. Crippling debt getting worse. Applying for jobs every day. Unsuccessful. Every marketing company that contacted me back was one of those MLM scam agencies, posing as legit businesses. 

***November 2019-*** Went home again for financial and health reasons. Kept applying for jobs.

***December 2019-*** Had a few interviews, but got turned down for a few things due to being home for the holidays. Finally got an offer for a phone sales role. I had little interest, but needed the income.

***March 2020-*** Have been working at new job since early January 2020. Pay is low. Hours are long. Metrics are unreasonable, and valued over actual productivity. Forced overtime with no pay. Employer won't even let us work from home during Coronavirus outbreak- despite having the tech to do so and confirmed/suspected cases among employees. I need to find a new job to transition into, once quarantine is over. 

&#x200B;

**So, here I am.** In the past, I've been told by hiring managers that my short-term assignments, lack of updated references, and resume gaps are red flags. I get that 100%. However, ever since graduating, I've been applying to crazy amounts of jobs each year and have been getting turned down due to lack of experience for 95% of those. Meanwhile, the jobs that have interviewed/ hired me have unfortunately been so easy to get a job with, or so it would appear, because they're not good companies to work for.

I am so set back in my life right now, all while desperately trying to get out of debt, get legal help for the cases that require it, and get my career started. I'm so depressed having to pay my student loans each month, despite not having worked one day in a full-time, salaried marketing role since finishing school.

&#x200B;

**What can I do (other than go to grad school), to get my career back on track?**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Since graduation, I haven't been able to secure a good job due to lack of experience. The companies that have hired me have been terrible to work for, resulting in short employment periods, a lack of recent references, and lots of resume gaps. This is affecting my ability to get a good job in my field and I don't know how to turn things around.

260,dzdkdt,False,None,91,How do you start wanting to work again?,careerguidance,"At 35, I am completely burnt out on my career. I got my PhD in a technical field. Afterward, I was briefly in academia. By the time I moved into industry 3 years ago, I already hated everything about the field I work in. After my time in companies, the idea of having to do anything for anyone (in a transactional, work-related way) makes me physically ill.

It's been over a year since I last applied for a job. If I see a job I'm qualified for, I give up at the thought of having to lie to someone's face and pretend any kind of enthusiasm for technical work. When someone asks me about ""data"", or ""machine learning"", it's the best I can do to hold back my bile.

If I see a job in a different career (and hence something I might potentially hate less), I'm turned off simply by the idea of having to self-promote.

I'm trapped by my semi-irrational avoidance of work-related bullshit, even as I miss being engaged in projects and... having good week days. I know to get out of this situation (whether that means career change or whatever), I am going to have to get through distasteful and uncomfortable situations, but I don't know if I \*can\* anymore.

I miss feeling excited and motivated by a new challenge, but I don't know how to recover that mindset. Anything positive about work  - whether money or the work itself - is completely overshadowed by the nightmare of politics and hierarchy. I also despise anything related to writing/creating software (which seems to be all anyone wants me to do).

I'm currently employed, but I dread every day of work and do the absolute bare minimum possible. It's not good.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do I get out of this?

264,cj1g4a,False,None,8,Want a way to get in the door to your dream job?,careerguidance,"Hi guys. Just want to share my story. I recently got into Reddit and saw this community. 
I just want to share my story here. I had a one hour interview with two managers. She said will let me know by next week. I walked out feeling not too great but then got a phone call only two hours later with an offer. Keep in mind, it’s a position that I wanted to get into since graduation so you can say is a dream position. I am nervous but excited too! It is in a field that is highly competitive and in a big city with lots of competition. 

After I calm down more, I reflect on what I have done to prepare for this. One of the managers know me just once a few months ago. She remembered my name and face and smiled when seeing me in the interview. 

Let me take you back with my strategy. I would say, if you want something badly, you need to find an alternative way to let the corresponding HR see your face or know your name at some way. 

I was so interested in this field of medicine, but the problem I had was I know nobody that works in this field at the time. My first strategy was to figure out how I can get into this community. 
Tip #1: find the job’s relevant association/club/society. For example, if you are interested in a psychology position, find the non-profit organization that support psychologists for education/network etc. I found a general request for more info box on he organization web page, and I wrote down something along the lines of: I am very interested in the field, can you connect me which someone that is in the field at XXX city area? I didn’t expect a reply honestly but I did and the secretary had found somebody in their organization that works in the field at my city that is interested in helping me. 

Tip #2: this person is a coordinator for the local part of the organization and willing to connect with me for some shadow days (after I requested it after some friendly and professional emails back-forth). I shadowed her for few days, on my last day (after strategically asking around where the managers’ office is), I went in person to talk to her (manager A) and hands a copy of my resume. I introduced myself to the manager and told her how I got in contact with the person I shadowed. She was very nice and accepted the resume but did say she has to go through the fair system of picking online process over paper. 

I didn’t hear back anything for about half a year. Honestly, mindset is so important. I didn’t focus too much on it but just have a mindset that it’s not in my control but I tried! I was able to make a connection at least! So I was happy and doing my other job in the meantime. I keep applying to the place I hand the resume to but didn’t really hear back. 

Last month, I decided it’s time to add spice to my “game”. I emailed the manager this time stating who I was and that I am still interested. I told her in the email that I have applied to the positions your department posted so please look out for that. 
I didn’t receive a reply. 

One week later, I got a phone call from the other manager B (to my very surprise since I didn’t know there were two!) and wanted to see me for an interview. 

Story goes back to now, I met the two managers. Manager A stated nice to see me again and remembered who I was. She said she forwarded my email to manager B. Manager B said that was very nice. 

At the end, the interview was challenging. But what I have learnt in this process that lasts almost half a year is so important. I also don’t think I was the most qualified candidate with the most matched experience and physical skills the job required. I believe my persistence helped them to make the decision to hire me. They know I am interested. They know I really wanted the job. They know I shadowed somebody under the team to know a little bit about the job. They know I put in real time and effort to make them know I want the job. 

I guess what I want to say is, don’t get frustrated with the process. Find a way to let them see you; find a way to let them know your name and intention.

I was hired because I’ve successfully managed a very large group that contained the brands target audience. I also successfully manage the page of a personal project of mine, and was part of Facebook’s community leaders programme. 

I had been working previously in politics in a communications role after graduating in 2018. The politics contract was very high level but it was only to cover a maternity leave, but it was a great opportunity at my stage in my career and I came out of it with my reputation enhanced. It was not a social media job, and was mainly geared towards traditional media.

I’m hoping to get back into the world of politics and communications full time, but in the meantime I was offered to take on this job. I wanted to make sure my CV didn’t lie empty in between jobs, the extra cash was of course appreciated and thought I’d be good at it. I thought wrong. 

I can’t stand my boss, I think the brand I’m working for is toxic, for example we were forced to turn off reviews. But anyway I’m three months in and realise that the Coronavirus has wrecked profits for the brand, and my social media posts aren’t reaching acceptable levels. We have a following of around 5000, and the reach of our posts is around 180. 

The money I get paid isn’t very much, but I’m afraid that I’ll get sacked, or I’ll quit and it’ll put off future employers. I don’t think the agency I’m working for would provide glowing references.

I just graduated in December '19 with my BA in English-Writing. I'm F, 26. Was going to go into education, but for a multitude of reasons, instead of teaching English I decided I wanted to *write*. I love to write anything. Poetry, creepy short stories, proposals, memos, academic materials and research...ANYTHING. I love the process and its really the only thing I'm good at. BUT. I have worked in customer service for 10 freaking years. I've lived w/ my SO since I was 19 and had to always work to pay bills, so unpaid internships were never an option. I had to take breaks between semesters because I couldn't afford to take time off of work to take classes. It's been a struggle bus to the finish line, but I graduated with a 3.8 GPA so that's cool. But now I have no experience in WRITING. Just customer service and restaurant experience. My portfolio is a few academic essays that I want to eventually get published, but that is about it. I have no real ""published"" samples to send with job applications, no real ""office setting"" experience because those jobs are Mon-Fri and I was in school, and no internship experience. All my counselors keep telling me is to ""get a masters and you could teach"", ""you have the GPA for masters"", ""publish your academic work"", yadada...I NEED REAL ADVICE. I could just go back to customer service, but I want to be in my field and making more than minimum wage, cause, ya know, STUDENT LOANS?

I am 31 and wasted my life due to various issues (clean record no drugs or anything but its a very long story to explain so lets leave it at that. ).

I have a non existing CV nothing solid. 

I know computer stuff (some programming, some pc architecture, some networking, some soldering and pcb diagnostics etc) but nothing on paper (either in form of certificates or provable employment ).

I have studied for a year (out of a 4 year graduate program) as a merchant marine engineer and worked for 6 months in a cargo ship as a cadet engineer. 

I have some (non provable) experience in door to door sales and phone support. 

I can speak 3 languages (English, German, Greek and a little bit French).

I am able to type ~150 words per second. 

I am a MENSA member (I know cheesy but at this point I think it might hold some significance in terms of indicating that there is a chance that I could learn something faster than average). 

I have worked as a waiter in a  fancy restaurant of a 5 star hotel.

I have some mathematics and physics skills as a drop off of an applied mathematics university.

I consider myself good in marketing and sales and have some sense of logistics in general. 

I am not afraid to work hard for long hours and do whatever (legal ).

I am from Greece and I am looking for employment anywhere within europe or north America.

My target is to work hard for 2-4 years and make some substantial savings that would allow me to stop working or work part time while pursuing my degree (and be able to pay for all the fees involved).

What do you think would be the fastest **realistic** way for me to do that?

And to prevent trolling no I am not sitting on my ass waiting for the internet to give me a solution but in the desperate position I am now a second opinion might aid to clarify my perspective.

Right now I am looking into getting a job in an offshore oil rig but I get mixed information for example I found that in many cases one can get as low as 1500 pounds a month.... which is not bad but considering you will cut off from society, eating canned food and that it is physically challenging job 1500 begins to seem small.

270,dgsnpp,False,None,69,Is it okay to quit a job if its causes high anxiety? I cant deal with rejecting sick animals.,careerguidance,"I had recently (1 month) started a job at an animal hospital and I thought it would be great. I love animals. I mean LOVE. I figured I could just try a part time job to see if I would maybe want to be a Vet in the future. Except from this job it was mostly just dealing with difficult clients. Like ones that belittle you and insult you. I could deal with mean clients. I've worked customer service in the food industry, but what got to me was the sick pets.

We would often get calls from owners asking if we can see their sick pets. Throwing up, seizing, itching, diarrhea, etc. It had a wide range. But the common thing was the pet was sick and the owner wanted them seen ASAP i.e. same day. Obviously I get why the owners would freak out and cause trouble but what really was causing me the emotional stress was having to refuse seeing their pets. This could happened several times a day and nearly every day I worked. We had to refuse to see the pet because there was only 1 doctor working at that hospital and we were constantly over booked and under staffed. 

When ever I had to refuse to schedule to see the sick pet that day I would try to make a future appointment for them but we were always booked out 2-3weeks out. The only other options was to direct the pet owner to another hospital or emergency hospital. This was often met with things like ""You're heartless to animals!"" or ""you guys really dont care huh?"" Like I said I've been cussed out by customers in the food industry before but it really hurts to be called heartless to animals when I really love them a lot. It just hit deep in my core. I dont know. I'm weak I guess. But this just ruined the work for me. 

I dreaded going into work each day. I fear clients calling about a sick pet. The work itself was already hard, requiring 4+ weeks of computer trainning and ~2 months of shadow trainning. I could have eventually adjusted to the hardships of the job, but the emotional anxiety just makes me want to give up. I wanted to quit week 1 but I tried to stick it out till now 1 month later. 

I know jobs can take a while to learn. I've have my hand in several other jobs in the past ranging 6 months to 2 years long. This just hurts and it's only been 1 month. 

I've written a letter of resignation and I plan to email it to my manager. I will text him to check his email. In my letter I said I want to quit immediately as I am still being shadow trained so I'm not covering any actually shifts and figured I might as well stop wasting the time of who is trainning me. I did offer to stay for 2 weeks if they wanted me to. 

I just want to know if this is the right way to do this? Is there a better way I should deliver my resignation? Can I quit without 2 weeks notice?

Should I even be quitting just because its emotionally destroying me? It has actually caused me to be getting sick recently and I cant focus in class. 

What do I do?

TLDR: Job causes me high anxiety because it deals with turning away sick pets and I love animals and just want to help them. I get yelled at by the concerned pet owners regularly. How do I quit in a professional way? Can I quit same day if they dont actually need me?

Edit: Maybe this will help some people. I am still living at home so rent isnt my concerned yet. Also some have been saying I need to suck it up bc I want to work as a Vet but I took this job to see if I was interested, not that this is my future career goal. I am actually studying Molecular Biology to work in the Biotech Industry currently. This job has solidified that I dont want to be a Vet. Also some have said this is the reality of the work force, so suck it up. Like I've said I have worked customer service before. I can deal with some crazy yelling at me about coffee being too hot or whatever. Just not this side of denying a sick pet.

Of course, I’m sure not everyone wants to connect with a happy-go-lucky person and some people appreciate the more serious, calm, and genuine personality.... but I’m really struggling to even have normal conversations with people who could truly help me, I know it has to do with me being fucked up internally/emotionally, but I would really appreciate some advice to help at the moment as I can very *very* rarely carry on a conversation without it becoming awkward (even when I want to!!!!!!)

I would really appreciate any advice :(

Edit: Just to clarify, I wasn’t referring to outgoing/talkative people when I said  “fake people”. I’m talking about people who put on a fake smile and use a high-pitched voice and act extremely polite to people they know they can get something from. I’ve seen these kinds of people and the second their target turns around they roll their eyes or just talk shit about them behind their back, or later on they’ll admit they actually hated them. I know that “you gotta do what you gotta do” to get places in life, but I’m just struggling to do that because I hate the fake pretentious atmosphere since I’m a very undiplomatic blunt person and if I don’t love someone I won’t entertain them. I hate “not living my truth” as cringey as that may sound.

In order to pull this off I believe it's a two pronged approach: mentally and physically.

Physically: I recommend taking some 5-HTP and St. John's wort supplements which help calm your nerves. I just started taking them and they've really helped alleviate my mood. Don't drink beer because that's classified as a depressant and will make things worse.

Mentally: Approach these events with a challenge mindset instead of a something you're afraid of. Be ready to take some losses and disappointments but don't let that be the focus. Instead, focus on how many positive exchanges you get. You only need 1 to be successful. You can do this by focusing on them not you! Small talk is not fake, it's a necessary little game for all of us to find out if someone is worth investing more into.

I lost my mom at the start of college. It did me no favors as she was the only positive person in my life. College didn’t work out for me and I never graduated. I feel like I’ve failed massively in this regard. I studied networking (IT)

I have a decent gig right now making 40k-ish a year. However, I wanted to be so much more. I wanted to be able to support myself and my elderly father. I feel like I’ve peaked with what I’m working with right now. I talked to school counselors and discovered I’d have to start all the way from gen ed and basically redo a whole degree. This was super disheartening. I also don’t have the luxury of  quitting my job in order to focus on school as me and my father have supported each other since my mom died.  Also, even if I went back to school, I would not continue down the networking path as it is definitely not for me.

So I feel pretty stuck. My job is not a bad job, but like I said, I feel like I’ve peaked. I want to move upwards in life, and by that I don’t mean I want fancy things and wealth. I mean that I want stability, safety, and security for me and my loved ones. I don’t want to just get by and be at risk for losing it all. I miss feeling like I was building a life back when I was still in school.

I work in creative/tech in a large North American city and recently interviewed for a lucrative contract role for a Fortune 500 company. 

The hiring manager and I mostly communicated through the recruiter at first but after several phone screenings and a great on-site interview, he started to personally call and email me. He offered effusive praise such as “everybody loves you” and told me that the job was basically in the bag. He even went as far as to tell me that they were not interviewing other candidates. I was thrilled!

The only catch? I had to complete a hiring assignment. OK, no problem.

I’ve accepted these in the past but usually they are only 1 to 2 hours at most. This one was easily 12 hours of work that I diligently completed and even went above and beyond in many respects. I had a friend of mine who is senior in the industry review my work and she agreed that it was very high-quality after I made just a couple of tweaks.

Getting to the point, the hiring manager totally blew me off and went with another candidate after I busted my ass doing this take-home assignment. I started to get suspicious of his motivations based on several red flags I regretted ignoring. Couldn’t even get any meaningful feedback from him.

Had an attorney write a letter to the company’s head general counsel reserving my copyright to the content and affirming they don’t have the right to use it. The wording was low-key, factual, and professional. 

I’m not trying to get any payment from them, just protecting my rights not to have free work extracted from me by a potential employer just to be ghosted after false promises.

Nobody knows about my condition because my boss has repeatedly said, ""if you're sick, just call in sick, I don't need a reason or an excuse."" Is this grounds to terminate me?

This pandemic is just the pin that has pricked the bubble that we call our economy. Its not the pandemic we have to worry about its the next depression.

This lockdown and fear of the pandemic is going to permanently change spend habits. People will start to spending less and saving more. Some people mistakenly think that a 401k is equivalent to saving. However they will soon realize that a 401k just a stock market casino where the investor always loss and 'they' always wins. Even with the recent stock market dip it has long way to fall. Life savings will as a result vanish. Also as customers start spending less and investors flee stocks, companies will start shutting down . Layoffs will increase while incomes and tax revenues decline.  A positive feedback loop will be created when enough unemployed stop spending money in other industries. This means more bankrupt businesses and more unemployment. 
 
Governments are powerless. Since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 the government have shot their last silver bullets. By lowered interest rates on loans to Zero in an attempt to stimulate economic activity for the last 10 years this has  allowed millions of people and businesses to get into massive amount of debt. This also has allowed the wealthy to stay in business to provide jobs for the poor so that they could feed their hungry children ( or do drugs) . But like drug addicts the economy IS addicted to these loans, because without it we will have to endure severe pain and suffering. A similar situation occured prior to the GFC where too many  un-credit worthy people and businesses got loans on homes they cant afford. ( Thank the irresponsible boomer generation for that)

However theres still hope. The government has a pocket knife left! 😆

Because now the Federal Reserve( the only privately owned bank in the USA that is allowed by law to print money for it self) is planning to make NEGATIVE rates.  This means that banks will start handing out. 💸 bonus for those willing to borrowing MORE money. Those Genius. Lol.  But Of Course only the "" Essential""  will ever get that money, because we all know the propaganda that some of us are more equal the the rest of us.😥.

During my spring semester of my senior year I applied to as many jobs as I could. My goal was to move out of state. When I graduated in May I didn’t have anything lined up so I continued to spend all my time job searching/applying. Then job market in my town is very scarce when it comes to PR/Marketing agencies, plus like I mentioned, I really wanted to move out of state anyways. 

Eventually it was October and still no luck so I knew I needed some type of income. I ended up landing a job as a counter manager for a makeup brand (basically a glorified retail job) and live at home with my parents. I was still trying to send out applications in the mean time to hopefully land something else. Then corona hit and I’m now on unemployment. 

I am feeling like I lost my chance. Here it is a year after graduation and I’m working basically a retail job (well was before corona).

300,g9zfyn,False,"Pennsylvania, USA",98,"Should I (25f) take the easy route and study library science, or the exciting, difficult route and try forensic science?",careerguidance,"**EDIT: WOW thank you for all your responses, everyone ;\_; I can't reply to all of you but there's some great advice in there. I really appreciate it. <3**

My BA (East Asian Language and Lit) has gotten me nowhere other than high-end retail, and at this point I feel like I need a graduate degree in order to progress. I certainly don't mind going back to school, but I'm not sure what I even want to do.

My top two choices are a) library science or b) forensic science.

Library science makes sense as it gels with my educational background and previous internship experience as a librarian and a teacher. The work would be easy, it'd be cheaper than other degrees, and it would only last two years. It's also an easy program to get into.

The problem is that I just don't... really... want to be a librarian. I don't feel any passion for librarianship. It feels like the easiest, most mundane choice I could possibly make, and I hate that. It would be stable. It would be smart. It would be very boring.

On the other hand, there's forensic science.

Pursuing forensic science wouldn't make sense, but it's my dream career. I am deeply fascinated by everything to do with forensic science and have been since I was a child. I read forensic news and research in my spare time (which I've had a lot of lately). However, it would be a complete 180 from any of the work I've done so far. I didn't take any STEM in college, I have no background in chemistry. Is this even plausible? Is there any way I could catch up??? I'm a quick learner and I absorb information fast; is there somewhere I could start?

These things might not even matter, however, as my choices are limited by my college transcript. To be blunt: it sucks. Nearly everything from freshman to junior year is a total garbage fire with a few Bs thrown in for variety. My main problem was that I was too busy sleeping and staring at walls to go to class; the second problem was the suicidal depression. When I did make it to class, I would sleep at my desk and take notes that were mostly nonsense scrawling.

Eventually I got diagnosed with narcolepsy, took a year off, came back a little more manageable. My senior year is all As. However, a college board probably isn't going to care about any of that. Any respectable program would take one look at my awful GPA and toss my application in the garbage. I also won't have any stellar letters of recommendation from professors, because, well, I was asleep, and a very bad student.

Sorry this is so disorganized. I don't know what to do or where to even begin. Which program should I choose? Should I even try????

I quit my job a few days ago when a better offer came along. I told my boss about the offer the week before, he tried to counter it, but in the end he wasn’t able to give me the title change and increase in responsibility that I desired. I wrote a letter of notice to him that explained this and gave it to him in person with a verbal explanation also. 

Part of the reason I am quitting is because of my boss. I’ve been unhappy at my job for at least the past year. I was also just bored and wanted to learn more. I had no idea my boss or coworkers even thought I was an asset until I tried to quit and they said that I was the best person they have ever had in that position and didn’t want to lose me. I have been paranoid about being fired the past 2.5 years I’ve been there. My boss seems to only point out what I do wrong and rarely compliments me even when I am working my tail off. He promised me a lot of things that he never followed through with. He said no to most of my ideas and then was upset when I didn’t bring new things to the company. I mainly avoided him because his main form of communication was yelling. Everyone else at the company feels this way about him. That their biggest problem with the company is him. 

I just want to prepare for this exit interview. What do they typically entail? Should I be honest about how his bad communication skills is part of the reason I’m leaving? He is about to retire in a couple of years, so is there even a reason to do this? Everyone knows him in my industry and I want him to remember me positively.

I’m based in the US.

Demonstrate you know everything there is to know about their co & what they do, through the questions you ask.  Make them fall in love with you through a single ?

2)  **You cared more about impressing them than uncovering their greatest need.**  You primped & polished, brought your heavy brag book and card stock resume, but you completely missed the mark on the fact that they are losing sleep because this vacant territory is losing 15k/day because someone's not there hustling.

So, I came to a place in my life when I realized I must change my career path. I graduated to be a teacher. I always wanted to be one because I love working with teenagers but I could never land a job because in my country this job is considered fancy (believe it or not) and you need to be a member of a political party, pay a certain amount of money ( basically bribe a principal) or have a strong connection and friendship to land such a job. I had none of those so I had to go and find another job. That is how I started working as a customer support and stayed at that job for 7 years (not in the same company though) because I don't have the luxury to be unemployed amd wait for the perfect job. I am almost 32 now and I literally DESPISE that job. I could never get a promotion because though I avoid conflicts and am helpful towards colleagues, I am also quite introvert and don't know how to 'suck up' to authority figures. However, I did manage to save a good amount of money (I do have other smaller jobs on the side that bring income too) and now I can use that money to follow my dream or go back to school.

The only problem now is that I literally don't know what I want to do. I am not sure I want to teach anymore, well at least not as a full time job. I would like to maybe go back to school and learn new skills but I just cannot figure out what job I would really like to have in the future.

I do like arts for example but I am realistic and I know that I am not very good and that I could never live off of that job. I also thought to start learning program languages at home because I like the idea of creating smth. I am a problem solving person, pretty good with details but then I read how I would have to spend years studying this and praying that someone will give me a job without a bachelour CS degree and I get discouraged. 

Since I am almost 32 I also feel that I really want kids and if I go back to college to earn a CS degree I am afraid I will miss out on having them. Now, I know some people will judge me but, I would really like to be a stay at home mom for a period of several years and use this time to learn a new skill at home or maybe take some evening classes. I actually like staying at home and I love chores. I don't mind cooking or cleaning, doing laundry etc... I even find it relaxing. My husband is a good and caring person but the problem is that he cannot aford to have me at home since he does not earn that much.

However, I have taken the plunge and quit the idea of having a customer support job ever in my life because I literally cannot take it anymore. My husband supports me in this idea because he wants me to have a job that makes me happy. Now I am living off of him and my savings while contemplating what to do next but can't figure it out.

But the biggest downside is my commute (1 hour each way on 3 different crowded and unreliable trains in NYC and no car). One plus is I get a lot of reading done! I would love to work part time there and focus on other creative pursuits but I need my benefits and I’m drowning in student loan debt so I also need reliable income (and lots of it). I just lose so much time in my life and am zapped of energy by the time I get home. So I stay up late to maximize my “me time” (mostly tv or artsy stuff) and then I’m exhausted in the morning. I lack the motivation to exercise or socialize much which I know is bad but I feel so drained all the time. I would love to live closer but it’s not an option right now because my partner’s son is in a great school district. I don’t want to quit (I have great benefits, a lovely work environment, caring employers, and the work is rewarding). Also my job is very niche which means it will be very challenging to find something comparable. But I’m also I’m going crazy and I’m depressed. Any advice?

We have a relatively small team that runs our assays and a supervisor that organizes the design. He’s also new—right out a PhD program, but I believe he’s worked in biotech before. He’s been working here about 7 months. 
Everyone else works really well together. I really like my colleagues and can rely on them to be efficient, capable, and communicative. Because the company is so small, this is really crucial to things going right. 
However, my supervisor seems to have alienated the rest of my coworkers with generally sloppy work that results in everything having to be redone many times over. This has been costing the company a lot of money and the CEO has steadily been getting more and more frustrated with him. Aside from this, he personally is difficult to get along with, tending to be passive aggressive and often pushing responsibilities onto others. Admittedly, I felt sort of bad for him receiving a fair amount of hostility, so I tried to work with him and tell his what I needed, but it’s mostly resulted in me cleaning up his messes and working significantly more hours because of it.

Earlier today, I put in a written complaint (along with another coworker) outlining this, as well as specific dates and times things went wrong, emphasizing that I find everyone else reliable and wonderful to work with. 

The CEO is apparently “thrilled” about the letter according to HR, noted that it was written in a professional manner, and personally came down to thank me for submitting the letter and ominously suggested that “things are gonna change around here”.

I think I’m just anxious because I’ve been trying to navigate this stuff for the first time. Would anyone have insight about what that means?

Should I look for new employment?",careerguidance,"So long story short, I work at an IT company in the customer service/dispatch department. I had an extremely grueling job in fast food before this one so literally anything would have been better. However, when I first started the glaring problems with the company started to shine through. Mainly the lackluster training to begin with.

The manager at the time was never present, leaving me to deal with a highly abusive senior employee (I'll call her A). She talks smack about everyone through chat and email, reports everything everyone is doing wrong to our bosses, withholds information, the whole bit. She is the literal worst. The definition of a narcissistic psychopath who gets off on hurting others reputation.

Eventually the original boss left and for whatever reason was replaced with someone who has literally no clue about our policies or what we do in our department. He is also never present and micromanages us through email and announces our mistakes in front of everyone. He blatantly ignored my email expressing concern that A was committing slander against me.

I used to have a workload that kept me busy throughout the day, but then the new manager's close friend got hired and started taking over about 80% of my original workload. She also gets away with everything because she is the boss's friend. Never ever gets called out on mistakes. I was then given the important responsibility of managing relationships with one of our most valuable clients. During my 3 month review, I was told I was doing great, and I should have more confidence in myself. (self esteem issues abound due to the negative reinforcement from A)

Then, out of nowhere, said important responsibility was snatched out from under me and given to the previous employee who managed it, due to ""The importance of needing someone more knowledgeable."" My manager stressed that it was nothing against me or my work ethic. I had a hard time believing that. I cried pretty much the entire day. How was I supposed to be knowledgeable about this responsibility if I was barely trained on how to carry it out?

The manager said I had more important responsibilities coming my way and he would be glad to go over them with me, I told him sure, but I never heard from him nor have I received any additional work (besides closing work orders, which is incredibly simple)..

I'm one of the stubborn few that still believes in the Good ol' days and i'm finding it very difficult to conform to the whole social media thing.  Don't get me wrong, i think social media is great and that it has its merits, but honestly, sometimes i could care less about what my ""friends"" had for dinner, vacations, MLM recruiting efforts, and charities begging for everything under the sun.  With that said, i have quit social media and i'm blissfully unaware of all the drama caused my ""friends"" posts on Facebook.

Not long ago, i started talking to a recruiter that was having a career fair in my country, and she sounded very interested on me.  I have been actively looking for a job (reading ads, applying online, requesting meetings, etc.) so for a senior recruiter to be interested on me, that's a big deal.  We chatted both on the phone and by email, made an appointment to meet at the company's career fair, and all went great.  I was told that as soon as the contract got approved, to expect a phone call for a potential opening.  I was also told that if i wanted to know the status of the contract, to follow the recruiter on Linkedin because that is the best most fastest way to contact her.  Problem is, i don't have a linked in account!  I also do not want one.  A few years back, i had started to build my profile on it but 2 seconds after it went ""live"" i got contacted by my ex which absolutely freaked me out.  It was then and there that i decided to forget about the whole linked thing, and i instantly deleted my account.

Well, as per custom in most US companies, I’m on a 90 day “probation “ period. About 3 weeks after starting I found out I’m pregnant. I don’t need health insurance or anything like that but I do want to keep my job. Right now because I’m still in my first trimester, my job is not affected. But it will be in a few weeks as I lift heavy things and I’m on my feet 7-8hrs a day. There is talk that I will be promoted to a brand new position in the company so this also makes me take pause in telling them. This new position is ideal because it’s behind a desk anyway, but I’m afraid if I say something before I get it, I won’t. I should throw in that the work is mostly seasonal, so while I would have a job full time, the busy season wouldn’t start for a couple months after the baby is born anyway.

329,be93ux,False,None,92,"28F , recovering addict , 3 time felon...What can I realistically do with my life?",careerguidance,"Hey guys , 

&#x200B;

Informative title , I know. I'm a pretty transparent type of person and don't mind being open and honest about the experiences I've had in my life so far. I apologize if this is long but truly appreciate anyone that takes the time to read. 

I'm a female , 28 years old , born and raised in the US , and have a long history of drug abuse. I've been sober for 4 1/2 years which will probably always be the best decision I've ever made in my life. I started using at age 10 , dropped out of high school at the end of my junior year and continued my destructive path until I was 24 when I got sober. In between all of that , I caught endless amount of drug charges , went through rehab and jail countless times , lost my father suddenly 2 weeks before my 23rd birthday and dealt with ( still do) a very broken family. Needless to say , a career was the last thing I was ever thinking about through these times. I managed to gain 3 felonies on my record ( all a direct result of my addiction ). Possession charges and a receiving stolen property charge ( I used my ID to sell something that was obviously stolen) During my years of active addiction I had pretty common jobs ; waiting tables  , selling glasses at a kiosk in the mall , telemarketing. Hated them all. When I got sober , a friend of mine was a crew leader for a construction maintenance cleaning company and got me a job. The hours were long , exhausting and my boss was a very opinionated woman who I somehow really got a long with but didn't always agree with the way she handled some business. After about 90 days at that job , I got promoted to Crew supervisor and had my own crew of about 6-8 people to run everyday. I didn't necessarily love the supervisor part of it all , but I did like delegating tasks. I also love manual labor. After about 2 years I left that job for a behavioral health tech position working in a drug and alcohol treatment facility.   I really thought at that time that this was what I wanted to do. I wanted to eventually get my GED and go back to school to become an addiction counselor. What ended up happening was me being taken advantage of at that company and made to run psycho educational groups every single day with no schooling behind me and only having a little over 2 years sober. I got burnt out , and I got burnt out quick. I became extremely checked out and ended up making a very impulsive decision ( which I don't regret but have absolutely learned to never do again) and quit my job without anything else lined up. The stress of the job fell off my shoulders but then the stress of life and careers jumped right on. I was jobless for the first 3 months of 2018 and finally found a job through a friend in the 12 step program I was in doing Underwriting for a Loan company. I had no idea what any of it entailed and was extremely nervous because not only do I hate numbers of any kind , but i'm horrible at math. Anyway , I'm still currently with this company and although there's no part of it that I really do enjoy ,and sitting at a desk all day is driving me nuts ,  I would never abruptly leave like I did the last one. It's a very flexible job , my commute is 10 minutes and my boss is extremely understanding when I need time off. Nonetheless , it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I recently , about 2 months ago , obtained my GED and now am trying to navigate what I want to do with my life. 

&#x200B;

I feel lost in the sense of never really having that chance to figure it out when I was a teenager because I was getting high. I have felonies now , although they are all about 8 years old at this point. I don't want to waste my time going to college for a degree and I ultimately won't be able to get a job doing because of my past. I also hear horror stories of people going into extreme debt for a degree that they can't even get a job for. I'm not willing to do that. I've been trying to do some research about trade schools but I also don't know if my body can handle doing that for the rest of my life. I had surgery on my ankles when I was a baby & have always had issues with being on my feet for long periods of time. I love cleaning and organizing and attempted starting up my own business but it fizzled out for the most part and i'm just not sure I want to own a business. 

&#x200B;

This is a lot and all over the place but it's a pretty good idea of how my brain functions on a daily basis. I'm not getting any younger and I can't help but feel like i'm running out of time. 

&#x200B;

Thank you to anyone that responds or takes the time to read!",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/be93ux/28f_recovering_addict_3_time_felonwhat_can_i/,162,"If I might dare to be honest, I would never hire you, not even for caretaking in the office, not as a temp, and certainly not for a full time position. It’s not a personal thing, it’s a risk thing. Felons are liabilities no matter how good they are at a job or how wonderful they are as people. The felon May not pose a risk themselves, but their status as a felon will always be a risk. If something goes wrong and their status comes out, we’re left holding the bag, regardless of whether or not their status had any relevance to the event. 

Just as you are being smart and realistic about the unlikeliness of being hired if you pursue higher education, you might also consider that even if you work your way up in a place that will hire you and you like it there, management shuffles over time and one day you might get someone like me in the company who will see your HR file and make it clear to the higher-ups that you have to be contained (because we probably can’t fire you if you already work there). Depending on what the laws are where you’re working, we may not be able to fire you, but we can flag you and basically end your career advancement (I know it’s not fair). Either way, it would be unfortunate for you, and eventually you wouldn’t want to work there anymore. Because risk follows you, your manager would be instructed not to provide a reference. 

I wonder though if you would be a good candidate for running your own business, or running one with someone else? A small business environment with very little hierarchy (ie, very few, if any, people like me) would also be a good bet I think. Either be the boss or be close to the boss—that’s probably a real good bet for you. Plenty of people with tarnished pasts do well when they’re not being cock-blocked by risk-averse, white collar folk like myself. 

If you can ever pursue a pardon, I highly encourage you to do so. 

I wish you the very best. It sounds like you know how to keep at it. Good luck—and sorry for being so blunt. ",2019-04-17 15:25:51
330,efwhmo,False,None,119,"I'm a manager and I don't know why but working for just profit feels wrong, can you help me out?",careerguidance,"I have tried to conceptualize wtf is wrong with my situation, but I don't really know. I think at the core of it is that as a manager I am consistently told I should be doing what brings the most profit for the business, but yet I feel like sometimes doing what is most profitable is also being a dick to my employees. Exploiting them as much as possible is the most profitable for the company.

I feel like my boss is not a person who seeks to pay people for the work they put in. He seeks to avoid giving raises as long as possible until his hand is forced, which is shitty because its basically him trying to exploit you as much as possible for as cheap of pay as possible EVEN when he recognizes value.

So my problem is two fold:

1. My perspective makes me feel like my boss relatively takes advantage of labor surplus to exploit workers for pay. We are being paid way less than him yet take on nearly just as much stress for our work. He takes trips to europe constantly.

2. The system of competing companies encourages us to under pay everyone in order to have the most future investment. Future value at the cost of current people and their happiness in their lives. How is that fair to the people of today?

I'm being pressured to ask for a higher quality of work from my employees when I already think they are underpaid and that they won't get raises even if they do more. How can I sit there and tell them to do more when they already seem underpaid to me? Hell minimum wage buys so little. The thing is, capitalism seems to be a big game of who can skeet their workers hardest. On the one hand, my current owner of the company I manage for makes too much and does too little. Frankly it is not good for a company to overpay anyone because long term profits go down from a lack of investment. How is it that every company can underpay all of their employees and that be whats best? 

Like these kinds of things don't even make sense to me in a moral sense. How can it be moral for us all to be underpaid? I'm just so confused when I think about business. How is it that my employees lives blow and yet I am still being asked to ask more of them?? Someone please explain that too me. I sit in my room trying to conceptualize it all and it feels like every time I think about it I'm just getting lost. Like I cant even sort it all out because none of it makes any sense. Why is our society this way?? If my workers are being underpaid in my opinion, yet globally others are willing to do the work for less, than I need to be getting more out of them. Yet they are already miserable. I am asking them to be more miserable. It is miserable.

How is it that my boss can take home a big fat stack of cash and that be fair? I just don't get it. How can bezos be paid 100000 per hour and it be fair? His work could not POSSIBLY be THAT stressful. Talent is being made happy and yet we are claiming that by paying talent it is intrinsically worth it to us. It's worth it to overpay Bezos because we get our value back? How could that be possible?

I can't even freaking figure out if my employees are overpaid or underpaid because they are miserable and life sucks on minimum wage in the US, yet people across the globe are willing to do their job for drastically less because they have never known better. It just makes no sense. How can my employees be broke nearly 24/7 and yet I need to be asking them to do more work than what they are doing?

I want to help people. I don't want to live a happier life than anyone else, but I don't know how to evaluate what is fair I guess. I have noticed how if you give people an inch they take a mile. They always accept handouts because many are not in it to be fair, they are in it for themselves. They don't give back when someone is too generous. But in order for me to not be too generous, I need to be putting a dollar amount on their work and idk how in my workplace because I dont think the work is worth it for the pay, but apparently it is?

I’m trying to post more on LinkedIn. Recently, my photography work got accepted into a gallery in a big city in my state—a big deal for me. Because of the current COVID-19 situation, the gallery ended up being online. I wanted to make a post on LinkedIn about it, but the catch is that my photo is technically NSFW (you can see a very very small portion of an areola in it of my female model). There are other photos in the gallery that are also technically NSFW, but it’s kind of the nature of the beast aka it happens in art a lot. Neither my photo nor the other ones I have seen are sexual in nature. 
I’ve shown my boss and my coworker the photo and they thought it was amazing, they weren’t offended by it. But then again, for context, photography is my hobby, it’s also not directly my day job. I’m a tech writer, and I sometimes photograph products, but that’s it when it comes to my pro photography work. On the flip side, I was in a previous gallery before for my photography work, and that previous gallery I did post about on LinkedIn.

335,ev4cu4,False,None,93,Is this the strangest first day ever?,careerguidance,"Hi,
I need some perspective on this situation. Thanks in advance!

I started a new job literally yesterday and here's what's up so far-
I accepted a remote job as a project manager after a very quick interview process (one week from call to offer and over Xmas week) interview process all over the phone. Post acceptance, the tell me they need me to start ASAP and push my start a week sooner than I offered (they pushed for even a week sooner but I was oot) so I've just started. 
In my preinterview on-boarding they tell me that they'd like me to come to the corporate headquarters outside of Chicago for a couple of days- all fine so far.

I get this email from the admin assistant like  'you'll fly in take a bus from the airport and stay in our corporate apartment for your trip'- ok weird that they don't use a hotel and not keen on an hour bus ride but still not worried just yet. 
Next email from my new boss telling me what flight to book on their corporate website. We are going to be meeting at the airport and commuting together and also staying in this same corporate apartment together. No car. Same space (thank God we have our own rooms and bathrooms within the space).  Ok- starting to get anxious.

Im still just rolling with it on Sunday. I met her at her gate (for the first time I've ever seen her) at O'Hare and she's like 'we've got 15 mins to catch the bus are you ok with running?' We ran across O'Hare to catch this bus with minutes to spare. She talks to me nearly the whole bus ride -some pleasantries and some asking me about my previous role. We get off the bus catch an Uber to the shared apartment. It's late at this point- there's no food in this 'stocked apartment' besides beer and oatmeal. We order food (she paid). I ate and went to bed exhausted from the day and the non-stop talking. I went up to my room to go to sleep. 
Monday- Woke up and got ready. We left this apartment and got an Uber to Starbucks for breakfast. We went to the office where we had a small conference room where we spent nearly every minute of the day together- we even took bathroom breaks together (how fun!).  
We do a bit of onboarding and starting process review and she gets visibly annoyed when I ask questions about process flow (learning it's her way or no way) and she tells me it's not my job to worry about the controls that I've always worried about in my previous roles. They are doing their own waterfall/agile hybrid process  I don't know anything more than the customer facing info on this product and she's really not inclined to expound- not your job- stay in your lane. I explain that it helps me understand what I'm doing if I understand the process and she shoots me down again. She said I need to take 'big steps back'. Whatever. I can be a talking head- dropped it..

So she leaves for a bit to have a meeting with her boss and comes back and starts pinging and calling her pms (this starts at about 3 Central) that they need to report numbers before EOD for some budget report. They don't respond she starts calling people. I'm trying to read SharePoint stuff because effectively my training is now over and I'm just another person in the room. About 5pm she's still working and says she be working late. She was weird about giving me a key to get into the apartment. Then pinged some other out of town people who were in the office to have me go dine with them- I didn't ask for her to do this. After some talking my way out of their group I was able to leave and get an Uber to a different place where for the first time I was alone in 24 hours. 
She texted me while I was at the restaurant to check in... Literally left the office at 530 and this check in was at 7. I decided to leave the restaurant because apparently I'm being babysat and came back to the apartment around 8-830. She's on the phone with her boss like 'she finally came home'.  She is sitting in our living room space (no TV's in any other space) working and is still literally calling people who will be my peers to send her data. I sit on the couch across from her and she said she got a 'weird vibe' from me and asked what was up.... (...l) 

She said she had concerns about me (in my life have never been an employee to have concerns about)- I explained that because of my experience my default is to monitor and control my teams work... AND this is DAY ONE. She's at this point still calling her employees, my peers to get them to send her different reports and such. She said to someone as I was in the room 'would you bet your job on that report' ?  Tells me she is often on the phone with her boss at midnight and 2 am. I mentioned work life balance and said I I don't really sync or look at work after I'm done for they day and she responded with 'so after 6 I'll just have to call your personal cell, right?'

 She presssed on the vibe thing - I said I had concerns about calling employees (literally one was on her way ooo and she was asking her to stop her commute to get her information) and felt this situation was strange - and from my experience this seems to be a process issue- either her employees aren't reporting properly or the data collection is flawed and then stepped back and said it was my first day and I only have a very limited view or her budget crisis situation and went to bed.

Would this all be not so bad if I wasn't trapped in a random apartment and had a hotel room where I could come and go as I wanted without feeling under a microscope? Is this just a really dumb situation? I reached out to my friends about it and one said I should be running away and the other said to collect my paycheck and do whatever they want. I will be leaving this office Wednesday and will be working remotely after...
It's 5 am, I can't sleep because this awful situation and even worse this stupid uncomfortable bed. Really starting to feel like this is all by design and they are trying to break me.(would that even be a surprise anymore? Lol)

How to Find and Develop Your Passion in Life

How do people find their passion? That thing that makes them get out of bed every morning
excited to face the day? Did they always know what it was or did they learn later in life?

First of all, your passion is not necessarily going to be what you do for a living. You can be
great at your job even if it’s not what your passionate about. So let’s divide this exercise into
two parts: FINDING YOUR PASSION and FINDING A JOB YOU ARE OK WITH AND THAT
ENABLES YOU TO PURSUE YOUR PASSION. 

Take a Deep Breath
Before we begin we have to be aware that you’re going to feel some discomfort at some point during the exercise. Fear, insecurities, impostor syndrome, what ifs. That’s all normal because change is hard, you’ve probably been in your comfort zone of misery at your job or in your present lifestyle for a while and it’s hard to push yourself out of that comfort zone. For now, just ignore the discomfort. Later we’ll deal with your limits, how far you’re willing to venture out of the zone.

Next, turn off your NEGATIVE SELF-TALK. It’s going to want to say things like, “I could learn how to dance. I’ve always wanted to do that. But there’s no way I can become a dancer at my age!” or “I’ve always wanted to learn how to fly a plane. But it must be so hard. I don’t
think I have the time. Plus it must be expensive.” Finding your passion is about taking action
not about listening to that negative little voice in your head that keeps you paralized with fear and doubt. It’s not about practicalities right now. It’s about finding out what your passion is and whether your passion is going to be a part of your job or something you do outside of your work.

Steps to Your Passion
Get a notebook and let's get started!

What would you be willing to do without getting paid?
What can you do for hours without getting bored?
How would you spend your time if money weren’t a problem?
What do you love to talk about when you’re with friends?
Who are you jealous of because of the job they have?
Look back at your life and identify moments when you felt great.  What were you doing? What elements combined to make those moments great?

Have you considered that your passion may be something you haven’t tried yet?  If you’ve lived in your comfort zone for a long time, chances are you haven’t tried new things much. What things have you always wanted to try but haven’t yet?  Painting? Learning a language? Writing a book?

What things have you done that you’re proud of?

Close your eyes and imagine yourself 5 years in the future. What are you doing? What lifestyle are you living?

Time to Do Some Cooking
Now, start combining hard skills, soft skills and the traits mentioned by the people who know you best.

Let’s imagine these are all ingredients and if we combine some of them, we can
bake a cake, if we combine others, we can prepare a salad.  They’re not the same food, but they’re both delicious.  For example, I speak 3 languages + I’m diplomatic + I love to travel = I can be a foreign language teacher abroad. On the other hand, I’m organized + I’m a good writer + I love reading = I can become a freelance editor or copywriter.

As you can see, those are two very different jobs, yet we arrived at both of them combining my different skills.

Steps to Finding the Job You’re OK with
As mentioned before, it may turn out that your passion is not your job and that's fine. That's true for most of us. But it's important to find work that doesn't make you miserable. So let's go back to the notebook!

List the jobs you definitely do not want to do or would even consider.

Make a list of your HARD skills. These are measurable abilities, school learned abilities such as writing, reading, math, using computer software.

Make a list of your SOFT skills. Traits such as etiquette, diplomacy, communication, listening, getting along with people.

Talk to your friends and family and ask them to (honestly!) describe your personality. Take notes.

What were you good at in school/college (it doesn’t matter if you liked it or not)?
What have you been good at in the jobs you’ve had throughout your life?
What matters to you the most when it comes to a career/job: The salary? The hours?
The work environment? Doing something you excel at?

Your Passion
Be flexible. A study by Stanford psychologists found that most people have the mistaken belief that a passion is something you find easy to do. When people pursued their passion and encountered challenges, they gave up. The researchers further studied mindsets about interests in an experiment where a group of students who identified as “techie” or “artsy” were given two articles to read, one tech related and the other related to the humanities.

Students who had a fixed mindset about their interests were less open to reading an article that was outside their area. Unfortunately, focusing one one area could prevent you from finding your passion, which could happen when you bring different fields together, when you see connections between fields that you might not have thought of before.

A Growth Mindset is More Likely to Lead to Your Passion
In another experiment, researchers showed students an interesting video about the origin
of the universe. Most students were fascinated. Then they were asked to read a
challenging scientific article on the same topic. A lot of students lost their initial
excitement and the ones whose enthusiasm for the topic dropped completely were those
who had a fixed mindset about their interest. People who may be interested in a subject
can change their mind when it becomes too challenging.

“Develop” Instead of “Find”
Researchers concluded that “Developing your Passion” is more appropriate than “Finding
Your Passion,” because development requires commitment, seeing things through even
when they become difficult.

Another path to your passion can be developing valuable skills that will lead to greater
career satisfaction because you’ll be financially stable and more likely to develop a passion
for a field you’ve cultivated deep expertise in. In other words, first establish the lifestyle you
want for yourself and then fit a career around your vision. First get your basic needs taken
care of by creating a plan for your life and part of that plan is the development of your
Passion.

Passion Still Requires Discipline
But no matter which approach you choose to follow, you will never develop your passion if you keep switching directions and following every shiny object that crosses your path.

Even if they have a natural talent, ballet dancers invest years of discipline and hard work on their passion. So do athletes. So do millionaires. And so will YOU.

Now step back and look at the big picture.
Is your passion something you can incorporate into your career/job?

Is it something you will be doing on your personal time, after you do your work at a job that is just FINE; it’s not your passion, but it allows you to live well and pursue your passion? ",2019-11-08 14:29:44

My colleagues have grown to dislike me and they've always looked down on me because I'm 30 years younger than all of them. I desperately want out because I don't fit in. They're all older and still mentally live in the 1950's, meaning since I'm a female in my late 20's, I'm expected to clean up after the older people and take pride in being a secretary. It's absolutely miserable. I get no benefits, pay is low, and my commute is horrendous at over an hour every single day on the city bus.

I've applied to some out of desperation but realized I shouldn't take them. I have a Bachelor's degree in Business and I do freelance journalism work, I have good internships and other work experience. I'm no ""newbie"" to the workforce, but I constantly feel like I am since I can't land anything more than dead end secretary work.

I want a creative job like in writing or film production (my Business degree focused on the Entertainment industry) but it's impossible to go out and meet people since I'm extremely burned out from my current job. The job is so boring that I can't stay awake, and I've become irritable, but I've never treated any of my colleagues badly. I get home and I'm mentally done. I can eat and watch a couple youtube videos, then I'm done. But I still stay up too late because I don't want to go to sleep, knowing I'll be getting up to go back to this horrible job. I've been severely sleep deprived since last year.

I applied for a job at a bank literally across the street from where I live and I hope I get it. While I don't want to do banking, at least it will get me out of where I am and it's steps away from where I live so there's no commute. There's nothing in my city that I want to do and I've been trying to network online and do freelance work online. I would almost have to move out of where I am, but it's impossible since I can't get a job that pays enough for me to move. I feel like I'm stuck in a never ending cycle of misery.

Not necessarily for the sake of me posting inappropriate things, but moreso because I dont want my boss knowing about my personal life in any regard? I keep my personal and work life as separate as possible? 

Is this actually a new rule? Is this allowed in general in any work place? I've searched for SEC compliance rules specifically about social media and everything that comes up is just about the businesses social media platforms.. not the individual employees?

Also, if there is a better sub to post this on, can you please direct me there? I'm not sure the best place to ask this.

Update: first I want to thank everyone that has weighed in here. Mostly everyone has been really helpful and helped me figure out this place is probably not for me. Hes always been a little bit on the inappropriate side and this just pushed me over the edge I think... I'm going to keep my eyes open to new positions in the area.

 I decided if he persists on this issue I'll deactivate my Facebook and tell him I deleted my snapchat. I think it's easier to hide a snapchat than a Facebook because you need the actual snap username and mine isnt recognizable as being me. Also I'd deactivate my facebook rather than change my name or block him because I have a really really uniquely spelled name and theres like 2 profiles that come up when you search for me (my own and one I had in mide school lol) 

I've not accepted any of his requests and have not added him on anything, it's almost the end of the work day and he hasn't come to me about it or sent any emails through the office asking. I'll give it a few days and if he asks for my snapchat I'll let him know it's been deleted. Aside from snapchat I only have Facebook and LinkedIn. When I first started at the office he tried to friend request me on Facebook and I declined it so now he cant add me and I cant add him.

It was a toxic work environment, and there was a lack of work even before this ongoing economic crisis happened. I was laid off a few weeks ago, and ended up receiving much more through unemployment due to the recent CARES act than I ever did working full-time. **A few weeks ago, I recieved a call from an HR assistant sounding like they were reading a script:**

""Hi is this (name)? I'm calling from (company name) to let you know you're rehired. 

We've had problems with others not answering us, so we called from a separate number to increase the chances you'd pick up. You are unable to reject an offer of employment without losing your benefits. If your performance is unsatisfactory during the time we're rehiring you, you will be fired, and you'll receive no benefits.

We've received a loan which is contingent on rehiring our old staff. We acknowledge most you are now making more money from unemployment, but we won't be matching it. We want to inform you that the loan only covers the next few months, and we'll likely have to lay you off again when the loan runs out, so please make necessary arrangements. Unfortunately, this would also be when the additional unemployment benefits from the CARES Act goes away, so you wouldn't be receiving any extra money than either unless new laws are passed."" 

Everyone is upset about this, the feeling is that we were tricked into working for a worse version of unemployment, and we have no leverage.

I gave her the opportunity to do a task related to the work and she did very very well especially considering she has very little experience in this field. 

I invited her for an interview and she was such an open person. Her personality was refreshing and she showed so much enthusiasm. She kept repeating how much of ah interest she has in this field and how eager she is to learn etc, she mentioned she’s easy to mould. I was really impressed with her attitude. 

However this role is meant for someone with more experience. You need to be technical and she doesn’t have the experience. No doubt she’d definitely put in the effort it takes to learn but, yeah. That’s my pickle. 

I’ve got a bunch of other candidates who didn’t stand out as much in the interviews but definitely have the experience i need and a lot of them are internal already meaning I feel like I owe them more, and then I have this one girl I can’t stop thinking about because of how just enthusiastic and refreshing she was.

And my situation hasn’t really changed any since then - I’ll still have to work full-time+ while going to school.

346,ctpb19,False,None,23,HR issued then rescinded a disciplinary notice to me bc they failed to read the dr note I submitted months ago; how protected am I? should I be looking for another job?,careerguidance,"I really thought this company was going to be a long term company for me. I'm working an entry level position but just started classes to move up in the company (a promotion requires more education). I even applied for tuition reimbursement for the classes I'm taking.


I have multiple health issues and checked 'yes' on the ""Do you have a disability?"" question when I was applying for this job. I've been working there for over a year. I was sick for two weeks last year due to smoke inhalation because our area had severe wildfires. I was then placed on a PIP for attendance and told that if my absences were due to medical reasons, I could submit a doctor's note for intermittent medical leave and my attendance would no longer be considered a performance issue. However, I didn't have health insurance until January, so I did not get a doctor's note until a few months ago. I submitted the doctor's note at the same time that I took 4 days of continuous medical leave and the doctor signed one note for both leaves.


Important to note that my manager who was handling the PIP transferred to a different location after I submitted the doctor's note. My supervisor was then promoted to take my manager's place. I had an annual performance review with my supervisor after she got promoted to manager. It was a positive review and I was given a raise. I mentioned the doctor's note at this time and my new manager said she had not yet been made aware of it. I thought that was odd but assumed they were going to fill her in since she had only just been promoted. 

Then in July, a friend of mine died very unexpectedly. Stress exacerbates my health conditions and I missed 1.5 days, then another day for her wake. The lead manager at my office was aware of my friend's passing as well as a few other people I had to tell when I called out. 

The next week, I had a meeting with my manager, my brand new supervisor, and a woman from HR who was running the meeting. They placed a disciplinary notice in front of me which I barely had time to read but it had 3 dates listed on it, dating back to my first attendance warning. 

I said I had a doctor's note on file for intermittent absences and that I was under the impression that was all that was necessary to satisfy the PIP I had been on. HR said I only had the note for the continuous leave I took, and I told her it was on the same note. When she found it, she confirmed that it was on there and swiftly yanked the disciplinary notice away from me. She then chastised me for ""not keeping my managers in the loop"" and also stated that she didn't know if they could accommodate me based on the leave my doctor recommended. She said she would follow up on the issue.

Since this has happened, my motivation to work has substantially dropped. I was putting in extra hours, volunteering to work shifts that needed coverage, and working on my school work to move up in this company. Now I feel that my head is on the chopping block and they are looking for any excuse to fire me, even the death of a friend. I'm stressed all the time, it's affecting my sleep and my health, it's affecting my job performance, and I'm terrified of calling out. I have one more month before I finish my class and am eligible for the tuition reimbursement that I applied for from the company. I'm trying to stick it out until then at least, but I'm wondering if my intuition is correct and I need to give up on this company and look for a job someplace else. And what happens if they say they can't accommodate my medical needs?

351,go32r2,False,None,122,Unhappy with my degree | How to move out of copywriting / advertising ?,careerguidance,"I’m about to turn 26 and I’m tired of feeling unmotivated and directionless.

I studied advertising and journalism with plans to be a copywriter, and I realized it’s not the path for me. I worked really hard in my classes, interned at a major ad agency, pulled all nighters for my school’s ad competition, and read every copywriting book I could get my hands on. By the time I graduated in 2016, I had no desire to work in the industry. I’ve been trying to figure things out since. I’ve jumped around from different jobs and plans, and now I’m unemployed and living at home. I’ve become pretty depressed because I always took pride in my drive.

I don’t want to rant *too* much about what I dislike about copywriting because I’m trying to move forward. I learned a lot about myself in college, became more introverted, and I don’t feel like I value anything about the ad industry. For example: I don’t care about trends / social media / ads in general. I value people who are genuine and don’t like the culture of selling and people pleasing. I tried to suck it up because I know this is a privileged ‘problem’ to have, but it’s hard to pretend, especially in an industry where there are so many passionate people trying to break in.

Anyways, I’m looking for ideas or suggestions on what I could do next and how I can use my time now. I consider myself a creative, but I’ve developed a lot of non-work related hobbies and passions and don’t feel the need for my job to be that ‘cool.’ I think some variety would be nice, though. I’m hoping to find something with decent pay and more stability than the more creative routes I’ve considered (freelance writing, photography, etc).

Some background info and ideas:

* Since graduating: I worked at a restaurant while getting an ESL certification and student teaching, but my plans to teach abroad fell through. Then I worked as a writer at a very tiny marketing firm for a year and a half. I moved to NY and have lived off of temp agency work and sporadic freelance writing and photo assisting. I was interested in learning about becoming a photographer (I’ve had some photos published in magazines), but ultimately there isn’t enough stability and too heavy of a barrier of entry for me.
* I feel ‘unmotivated,’ but there are a lot of things I am interested in (work and non-work related). I’m really interested in people/ethnography, language, visuals / art / design / clothes, psychology, music, and nature / conservation. Obviously no job will encompass all of these things, but it’s a start.
* This isn’t a priority, but I’d like to be in a less conservative work environment if possible. I am a photographer and artist and like a lot of esoteric music and film. It would be great to not feel like I’m hiding at work.
* I’ve got job ideas related to my interests but most of them don’t seem that viable, especially now. I care about money and stability more than I did before, and I’d rather pursue freelance writing and photo projects outside of work.
* I’ve been interested in and looking into tech / coding related jobs, but I feel like this has become a go-to for people not knowing what they want to do. Is this worth looking into? Is it realistic to start learning now and find a job soon?
* I've been working on side projects to keep some motivation. I'm working on a website / social account with a friend right now highlighting style and aesthetics in jazz. I'm working on a long-term photo project, making playlists and a fake ""radio station,"" and hoping to take some drawing and French classes for fun.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. I need to figure something out soon since I lose my health insurance in the next couple months, but I’m trying to break this pattern of lulling around. Any ideas, suggestions, reality checks, etc are welcome!

I just watched an interview on post Covid19 world and the expert they had on made a statement which perked me up. 

He stated that 'when things recover, many people had time to think about what they want to do - many people will decide not to return to what they were doing before. This is going to be the biggest career transition in all of history'.

I am somewhat doubtful with this statement, however it does apply to my situation. I have been planning and working towards a career change well before covid situation. Now I am even in more hurry to move into a different field.

What are your thoughts? Do you foresee many people jumping ship? are you planning to returning to your old post if still available?

**Source:** COVID: Metamorphoses | Google’s top-rated futurist on post-coronavirus world | SophieCo. Visionaries",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g44t58/the_biggest_career_transition_in_all_of_history/,155,"I think this affects people in different ways. It comes down to Maslow's Hierachy of Needs.

People that need to cover their **basic needs** (physiological and safety needs like food, water, warmth, rest, security and safety) will not be in a position to actively choose a career change (whether they liked their job or not). They just need money to have basic living. They might have been in low income jobs with relatively high expenses or even higher income jobs with relatively high outgoings too. If they have lost their job or business, they go back to basic needs.

People that have their basic needs covered, even when they don't have a job (due to low expenses and outgoings and either savings, financially support from elsewhere or passive income from other investments) may then look to fulfill their **esteem needs (around prestige and accomplishment)**. Some may look at self-actualization (to achieve their potential - this is more about growth and contribution to society - looking for greater meaning and purpose in life).

I suspect that t**he time reflecting during lockdown will switch those people focused on prestige and status more to self-actualisation.** People have realised that fancy things are not as important as they thought they were before. It's not as big a deal anymore to have a business meeting on a video call with your kid in the background - this is more acceptable now but never would have been before. Image and luxuries aren't so important to many on reflection. When we are not in control of things in life, we reflect on the most important things. This happens at the time someone dies in particular, but this time of reflection in confinement for many also has made some reflect on some of the well-documented top regrets of the dying (by Bronnie Ware):

  
 **Top Five Regrets of the Dying**

* I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
* I wish I hadn't worked so much.
* I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
* I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
* I wish that I had let myself be happier.

So I think **people who are in a position to afford it will be looking for a career change if they were unhappy in their job**. And **those that were happy motivated by money or status before may be thinking to contribute more to society and lead more meaningful lives**. So purpose-driven career change will be more prevalent for this group. However in total numbers, this group of people is by far the minority of people.

The majority of people, particularly in the North America and Europe, will be at least in the short term (next 6 months) be looking to keep their jobs. And if they have lost their jobs, they will be struggling with making basic needs, even with government support.

There will be a huge demand for services that enable people to save money. Any startups that create real solutions in this space will do well.

I am interested myself in those that are looking to make a career change now and why. The ones whose basic needs are not being met will only make career changes because they are forced to as entire industries are changing e.g. travel and hospitality will take some time to recover. 

Society and individuals will and have become more resourceful and flexible as a result of this crisis (through necessity), so I think there will be some great startups emerging from this and also people just hustling to make ends meet as there won't be jobs for them for a while.

They unsuccessfully tried to have my GD review removed (and a coworker got a legal notice of defamation about her review, lol) so I occasionally check up on their page to make sure it's still up.

It's because you look like him.""Internal Monologue\- ""Why are you still talking?"" Having a coherent, meaningful conversation is hard enough. But with the pressure of a career involved, successfully interviewing can be darn near impossible. I know what you are thinking\- ""Interviewing is easy...I'm great with people."" Confidence is great, but it will only get you so far. As well as the interview is going, you can just as easily talk yourself right out of the job. Sure, the person interviewing you may be smiling, but you never know if they're just being polite. Official feedback may be\- ""We really liked you and your thought process, but..."" but internal feedback may be\-""I am stupider for having heard that."" Interviews, for the most part, are structured and simple enough to prepare for. Anyone can answer specific and factual questions about their experiences and career. It's easy when there is a format and the candidate is led down a path of responses. But there are two key areas that are difficult for candidates. When you get to these ""open\-ended"" portions of the interview, that's where panic can set in. As a recruiter, the two questions I get most \(other* than How do you sleep at *night? and What is it like to not* have* a soul?\) are

1. How do I answer when I am asked ""Tell me a little about yourself?""
2. What do I say when I am asked ""Do you have any questions?""

Simple right? In theory, these are very easy questions. But the more you think about it, the easier it is to become confused and disoriented, resulting in a panicked mess of silence. Or worse. You could compare the person you are talking to with an overweight buffoon.

## Tell Me A Little About Yourself

Keep in mind, the interviewer isn't asking for your life's story. The key words are ""a little."" But which part should you share? That time in 4th grade that you totally rocked it at Field Day in the tricycle race? I know I know, it shows determination and coolness under pressure. GRIT. Technically this would be better suited for a LinkedIn video recreation. So what IS the interviewer looking for in this answer? They are really just looking to get to know you, your personality, and what details you find relevant to your own life. They want to know your conversation style. Don't overthink it. The more you can relate it to your career, the better. Keep in mind, they really don't want to know ""you"" during this initial meeting. They just want to know ""work you."" The polite, sterile, first impression you. You can dictate the first impression you make. Practice it...don't just wing it. Remember\- there are technically no ""wrong"" ways to answer this question. Keep it short, keep it sweet, and keep it RELEVANT. Some examples\-GOOD \- I've lived in this area my whole life. On a personal note I enjoy reading, fishing and traveling with my family. On a professional note, I've been in recruiting for more than 15 years now and it's a passion of mine. I love staying current on the latest techniques by following X, Y, and Z online.BAD\- I do a great impression of a hot dogGOOD\- I spend a lot of time in my craft studio. I fancy myself quite the amateur woodcarver. Sometimes its good to get away, enjoy the quiet, and just focus on the best way to create something. I find that it keeps me refreshed for all of life's challenges and keeps the creative juices flowing.BAD\- \*knocks over water and runs away\* Also, confidence is great. But you don't want to come off as arrogant. For example\-Interviewer\- I just love a good cup of Starbucks. You like Starbucks Adam? I love a nice venti soy blonde latte. What's your drink of choice?Me\- I like a large coffee.Interviewer\- You mean venti.Me\- No, *Venti* is 20. Large is large. Infact, Tall is large, Gra*nde i*s Spanish for large. Venti is Italian. It's the only one that doesn't mea*n l*arge. Congratulations, you're stupid in 3 languages. Just keep it simple, basic, and most importantly, safe. Who you are, what you are all about, and why your career is what it is. Don't just rehash your experience and your career....talk about how you the person have evolved in the career and what you get out of it.

## Do You Have Any Questions?

The answer is never ""no."" Never. You want to show interest. You want to show that you are thinking long term about the role, the company, your career. A ""no"" shows a limited view of the role. There is zero chance you completely understand everything discussed about the role, the company, etc. When you say ""no"" it usually means\-

1. I just want this to be over because a\) I need to get back to work b\) I need to make the train c\) My meter has been up for 25 minutes and my car may be getting towed right now.
2. I can't hold this bodily function in any longer.
3. I am not a forward thinking person. I didn't hear anything during the interview worth following up on. I am a person of limited imagination and thinking exhausts me.
4. I could care less about this particular job. I just want a job. This job would do. Kindly stop talking and offer me this job. I need money.

### Questions You Should Ask

1. Why is this position open?/What happened to the last person in the role?
2. How does this position contribute to the long term success of the company?
3. What is the average length of time someone spends in this role?
4. What is the growth plan/career track for this role?
5. Typically, what are the biggest challenges one encounters when starting this role?
6. Based on our conversation today, what parts of my experience do you envision being the biggest assets in this role?
7. Based on our conversation today about my experience, do you anticipate any difficulties of my getting up to speed in this role?
8. What is your estimated timeline for hiring for this role?
9. If I think of any other relevant questions, would you be offended if I reach out? Do you prefer email or call?

By asking these questions, the candidate is able to:

* Exhibit an understanding of what the role entails.
* Understand and demonstrate their experience fits in \(and doesn't\).
* Show they understand the macro impact of this role on the company.
* Show they understand the micro focus of the role as a self\-contained job
* Have a general idea of when the role will be filled.
* Obtain a reason/permission to follow up with the hiring manager.

Having all of that info from the hiring manager at the end of the interview allows the candidate to have the best Thank You letter ever. The candidate can reinforce ""why"" they are a fit for the role. The candidate can address the potential shortcomings the employer has identified. And the best part is, they have some time to think about it to put the best message out there and leave the best impression with the hiring manager. Without asking those questions...when you tell the interviewer ""Nah, I'm good. No questions,"" your follow up letters look like ""Hey, remember that time when I interviewed? That was awesome.""Odds are 1\) It wasn't awesome and 2\) They don't remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8hnlfs/so_what_should_candidates_say_on_interviews/,149,[deleted] ,2018-05-07 13:45:57

I always recommend “hacking” the application process by not only submitting their standard form of applying, but trying to make a connect on LinkedIn, trying to meet someone from the company in person (not by stalking, but at a career fair, or maybe if they host an event) or getting creative in that sense.

365,e8bltx,False,None,35,I am riddled with anxiety every day because I’m scared of getting fired again. What do I do?,careerguidance,"It’s almost all I think about any day. The littlest things will make me anxious. Some back story:

I’m a front end web developer. I live in a medium sized city, about 2 hours from a major US city. I’ve been fired from my last 3 jobs and it has riddled me with anxiety. 

1. When I graduated high school, I got a job at a small agency as a developer. I was their first employee, and at 18 that was a lot to handle because immediately i was made everyone’s “superior” that they hired after me. I managed the sales team and dev team. We hired an intern who’s uncle was extremely wealthy. She had a horrible attitude problem and made working with her not fun. After multiple complaints and attempts to talk to her as well as stress from missing a deadline, I eventually snapped and yelled at her. I didn’t swear at her, just yelled. She was so offended by it she complained to the owner and threatened to quit and I then got “laid off” to “protect the company” from her scary uncle. 

2. I was burnt out from the headache that job was and went into IT. I got a job at a local hospital and got fired for being on my phone too much. What was funny was that I was not on my phone any more than anyone else was, in fact we really didn’t have much to do other than be on our phones, but being 19 for whatever reason I was singled out. I will take the blame on that as I shouldn’t have been on my phone at work.

3. Worked at a fortune 50 company in IT. Worked there for 3 months and was fired. Absolutely no idea why. At that point, I was so scared of getting fired I just simply went into work, did my job, and left. My job was in a call center answering IT phone calls. Everyone I closely worked with liked me, never had an issue with anyone. One day on a Thursday I went in, my badge didn’t work, and all my stuff was in a box. They refused to tell me why and to this day I have no idea why I got fired. 

Today, I moved to this new city and am a developer again. I work at another agency and it’s a good job. I like the people I work with. I want to start my own agency one day and this is a great opportunity for me to learn more about how bigger agencies operate. 

However, this agency is going through some “growing pains”. They’ve fired 4 people in the 2 months I’ve been there including the person I replaced. This is not a good feeling. I get super anxious all the time. All day I am riddled with anxiety. It hasn’t gotten to the point where it effects my performance, but I’m terrified I’m doing something wrong always. If my boss messages me in a weird way I freak out. Today I swear she was acting weird and it had freaked me out. I know they will continually bullshit me and act like it’s fine until they fire me because the girl they fired on Friday didn’t even know it was coming. I’ve made attempts to check in and ask how things are and they say i’m doing great but I don’t believe them. The last 2 jobs I had management said how awesome I was doing and then they fired me days or weeks later. 

This is not healthy but I don’t know what to do. I can’t keep sitting here with this much anxiety because i’m scared to get fired. I don’t have any savings because every time I get fired I have to drain whatever savings I have to not be homeless. I finally have paid down the majority of my credit card debt but the idea of having 0 savings and no other income is scary. I don’t know what to do.

I'm in grad school currently, but I will be dropping out because I can't stand it.

I have absolutely no skills or talents. I can't see anything positive I have to offer and I'm sure there will ALWAYS be plenty of people better than me for any job position, so there's no chance any reputable place would hire me.

When I was furloughed I was specifically told that this what not due to performance issues; that it was simply a business decision, and they were going to fight for me to get back to work as soon as possible. This furlough was not supposed to last past July. Recently I finally get notified of a meeting to discuss ending the furlough, and I'm told that I am being let go due to performance related issues, when I left on a good note, and have not even been working!

Come to find out, while I was gone my boss threw me under the bus, and told everyone that certain projects were not done on time due to having to redo my work. When in reality I had been in constant communication with my manager about the status of these projects, and repeatedly asked for meetings to discuss advancing the projects to the next stages which were then postponed.

377,efdeky,False,None,76,"A recruiter lectured me regarding my handling of my interview, and then extended an offer; should I still accept?",careerguidance,"I recently began applying to jobs (I’m in marketing) because my current job has become stagnant and I felt it was time for a change. I am still employed, and intend to quit upon accepting an offer elsewhere. 

Over the span of a couple months and about 20 applications I finally heard from a company. The business is a large company based in my city with locations all over the US and Canada. They wanted to get me on the phone ASAP for a screening with the company recruiter. That went well and I was scheduled for a phone interview with the hiring manager. This also went very well. The call was originally scheduled for 30 minutes, but continued for about an hour. The next day I heard back from the recruiter that they wanted to schedule an in-person interview.

I was told what time to arrive for the interview and was told to “plan for an hour or little bit longer”. I showed up right on time and the interview began promptly. I nailed every question and from what I could tell, they were very impressed with my experience and potential. It was all smiles and good vibes from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. I never once looked at the clock because the conversation was fast paced and smooth. When I left I looked at the clock in the car and it turns out the interview lasted just shy of 2 hours.

The next morning (this morning) I received a call from the recruiter with good news. They were extending an offer to me! Naturally I was ecstatic, but the recruiter quickly turned the conversation to an issue that had come up in my interviews. She told me the hiring manager expressed to the recruiter that I went over on time during both of my interviews, and that if I wanted to work at this company I would need to “nip that in the bud” because this company takes meeting schedules very seriously. She went on to give a light lecture about time management and learning to read the room.

I was completely caught off guard. Generally speaking I think I’m pretty good at room reading and receiving social cues. I was also taught for years that it can often be a good thing when an interview goes over its allotted time since that usually means they like what they’re hearing. I’ll remind you that the room was all smiles and good vibes. They spent about 3/4 of the time asking me specific experience related questions, and left the remaining time to allow me to ask them questions of my own. 

This whole thing is making me think about what kind of culture this business might have. They lectured me before I even worked for them. It’s made me seriously consider not accepting the offer. 

Am I over reacting? Is this normal? I’ve worked in a professional environment for years so I know how to operate and communicate in an situation like this. Should I reject the offer and wait for a different opportunity?

**Quick break down of my situation:**

My only goal after graduating university was to travel. I grew up quite poor and so never travelled or had a passport as a kid, so seeing the world was my absolute number one priority.
Since then I’ve lived in New Zealand, California, Vietnam and Cambodia and paid for it all myself doing basic retail and hospitality jobs, mostly for charities. It’s been wonderful and nice but now I’m back in England and suddenly faced with the reality of being pretty much unemployable for anything other than the most basic of work, and it’s a bit depressing going for with 16 year olds of minimum wage jobs. I totally accept it as the price I’ve paid for travelling for so long, but I’d like to get going on a real career as soon as possible! 

**(You can probably skip this next bit but slightly more info if you’d like it and I thought it was kinda well written):**


My parents are a bit like sims that you’ve maxed out on the ‘kind nurturing and dependable’ stats and totally dumped the ‘successful career advice’ ones, which is great for making me not a serial killer but totally unhelpful in terms of being any help in my current situation. The world of professional employment seems like it might as well be the moon for how achievable it seems.
At the moment I have the exact same feeling of unbridled terror as I did the first time I tried to cross a road in Hanoi. Fortunately, once I’d got to grips with how Hanoi worked it became my favourite place in the world, and I have no doubt having a professional career and life will end up the same way! I just really need someone to grab my hand and guide me through the 6,000,000 loud beeping scooters of confusion between me and the questionable street food vendor that in this terrible metaphor represents my career.


I’m working part time in a vegan wholefoods co-operative at the moment which is a nice work environment and allows a lot of freedom with when and how much I work, but I’m definitely ready to start a career and try and get employed somewhere that has long term security and means I’ll be working with adults rather than 16 year olds!


**The actual important bit! (Finally):**

I have an undergraduate degree in Radio production and Technology (Bsc) which is pretty useless so I’ve just been looking into perhaps studying either a conversion course or just going on to do a masters that will make me more employable at something. I’d love no nonsense professional advice on what masters would be achievable with my degree and would equip me to start work in a particular field upon completion.


My degree is a science based degree but it only vaguely touched on coding or anything like that and it was a hell of a long time ago, but I wouldn’t be adverse to studying that more! My only real concern at the moment is I don’t want to waste more time. I don’t want to study a masters/conversion course that just puts me back in this position in 1 or 2 years time!


Becoming a teacher is definitely an option that is up for consideration, but I know it’s arrogant to think I could just ‘fall into’ teaching as a back up option, so any advice from teachers who have maybe been in my situation is great too!


**TOO LONG DIDN’T READ AND BECAME INFURIATED:**

What I’m getting at is that I am ready to start my career and quite open about what that career could entail! My only concern is that I want to study/pursue something that will really help and progress my career prospects. My biggest fear is going to study something then end up back at square one after graduating! What can I work towards right this second that will give me genuine prospects and options in 2 years time?

I just want to make sure I’m on the path to somewhere as opposed to wasting time getting older and I have nobody in my life to sit me down, tell me I’m a dissapointment and explain the options and the pitfalls in front of me, so you have to be my dad reddit. Get your shit together.

Normally, not having gotten a review by now wouldn’t be that big of a deal, except for the following:

I started on a Monday, and on Friday I was offered another position that was more in line with my background, and told that it would pay better as well. Of course I accepted, and after about 3 weeks I assumed the new role. 

Once in the new position, I was instrumental in literally saving the department from collapse, and it is now more profitable than its ever been. 

I was instrumental in helping collect over $35,000 from a client due to a past connection with them (I’m not in finance or collection, and through my connections was able to clear up some communication issues that got us paid quickly) 

At my 90 day mark, my manager was terminated. This has nothing to do with my specific department as he wore several hats, but it did require my partner and I to work more independently. We now manage our department with minimal supervision. 

I’ve also brought in two successful referrals, who are doing well. I’ve brought in guests to speak with management about opportunities to expand and strategies for making that successful.

386,dd80de,False,None,32,I've gotten to the point where I cant figure out what I actually do for a living anymore?,careerguidance,"To help understand how I got to this point, and where my confusion lies: I'm 31F, and I have a trade certificate in Drafting, no degrees because I'm dyslexic (I do want to try again). I also have no experience outside of the company I work for. 

I started in a small company that has grown about eight years ago as an intern, working in the design department and call center.  Over the next few years, I became a drafting and sales assistant. I then focused solely on Drafting. I developed the drawing office around the companies needs. After about 3 years, I found myself in the position of drawing office manager, out of ease more than ability probably. I was allowed to hire a couple of intern draftsmen, and they became so capable that I started to have a crazy amount of free time. 

I started providing illustrations, and renders to our marketing department as they were looking for a freelancer to do this, I taught myself using freeware, without costing the company anything. The technical guides at the time were elementary, so I started creating documents and illustrating them to help sell our products more effectively. The CEO started using me for his own projects, and I started communicating with suppliers and assisting with developing products offshore. I stopped drafting entirely and had to hand over the drawing office to someone else.

After about 5 years in the company, I was promoted to a product manager, and given a specific line of products. The only other person assisting with this was one of the executive's very capable cousins. About 2 years ago, we hired an R&D manager, who happened to be the sister of one of the Executives. We get on like a house on fire, and she had several years of corporate experience, a masters in her field and helped me polish up professionally. She has somehow become my unofficial manager, though none of the higher-ups wants to say it out loud. I'm happy with it, the entire department runs smoothly owing to her.

The problem lies in that we are under-resourced. It's just the cousin, manager and myself as well as a few strategically placed offshore colleagues.  They keep threatening to hire more people but never do. My manager started using me for product design and rapid prototyping owing to my history with drafting skills, adding to my workload. Then she tackled the technical documentation process, and I suddenly became the liaison between our department and marketing, developing these documents. Including outlining the content, writing, illustrating, researching, data collection and sorting. She edits and we have a back and forth over the document until its ready to send to marketing.

So now I'm managing and developing a product line. I'm designing products outside of that product-line, providing technical support and writing as discussed above, and after all that, my pay-slip actually says R&D manager.  The only thing I don't do other than editing is manage budgets, which the CEO does himself.

So what am I? A Product Manager? R&D manager? Or am I really a Product designer? Maybe a Technical writer and illustrator? By trade, I'm a Draftsman. Do they fall under some all encompassing job title. Do Product managers or R&D managers usually do this stuff? 

A job title seems like such a small thing, but I want to go back to university, it is not going to happen with the workload. I also want to renegotiate my salary. Not because I necessarily want more money (which I do!), but because I if they keep getting the milk for free, why buy more cows?  I adore my job, but my current salary is along the lines of a mid-level draftsman, which doesn't reflect my (perceived) value to the company or based on my official job titles, regardless of the qualifications.  Can I even make comparisons given that this all is so dependent on the niche I've created for myself within the company? And the company has done so much for me as well but after 8 years, at what stage do I stop paying it forward to them and start focusing on myself without been ungrateful?  If I could just figure it out.

It has been a proud couple of months for me - I both turned 40, and started a fantastic new job that I had been targeting for a very long time, after finding myself unhappy and depressed in a dead end job in a separate industry at 35. I was able to do this without taking a pay cut.

It has been a long, and at times painful journey fraught with difficulty, but is it one that might offer some value to someone out there.

Would anyone be interested in reading such a story?

Edit: Ok I will write it up. Will need to be tomorrow morning though. I would like to do a good job of writing it, and I need some sleep.

**OK here we go:**

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that my experience will not be applicable to everyone. We all have a different situation, and some of the things I describe will not be possible to replicate. That said, it is my hope someone will get something out of it, even if it is just motivation rather than a strategy or practical advice. 

Secondly, I also need to recognise that luck played a part. I would like to believe that some of the luck was created through hard work, but at certain points people did things for me that they really didn’t have to.
I will try and keep it brief, but my story takes place over a long time with lots of twists and turns, so you might want to grab a coffee! Anyway, here goes.


Five years ago, I had painted myself into a career corner. 12 years working in a technical role for large Telecommunication companies left me with a very specific set of skills in a profession I had no passion for. (I don’t want to divulge too much detail about the role, as I don’t want to offend anyone who does it). I had grown very competent at it, but it wasn’t for me. Added to this, the only way “up” was through general management, which held little appeal for me, and in an area where people traditionally retired after doing the same role for 40 years or more, there was also very little opportunity for development or movement.


Anyway, one day I had an epiphany (won’t go into detail), and decided I absolutely must change something, anything.


Trouble is, and I think there are a lot of people in this boat – *I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do.*


My first step was to look around for other jobs at the company I worked for, as I figured it was probably practical to make an internal transfer in a company that trusted me, than go in “cold” elsewhere. I had a good relationship with my Line Manager, who was very understanding and supportive. He didn’t want me to leave, but he understood that I was unhappy and that in the long term it would be no good for him or for the team to try and make me stay. I suppose you could say that my first stroke of luck was having a good relationship with an intelligent and supportive Manager. 


We devised a plan. Under the guise of “professional development” in learning about the company, he arranged for me to spend a day with other teams, based on job descriptions I saw on the company Intranet. All had partial skills matches with what I did already, and on paper a role within any of the teams would represent meaningful career progression. I did this about three times, and I certainly learned a lot – about what I didn’t want to do. Here was a lesson learned for me, no matter how amazing a job description sounds, the reality can be much different.


I kept going. Then, a stroke of luck: while this was happening, my team were “treated” to a training course. It was the first piece of official training most of the team had had for nearly a decade, so we were looking forward to it. I was on a specific piece of software we were migrating to, and it was very hard to use. It was so specific in fact, that the trainers had to be flown in from Europe at great expense. 


They “phoned it in” as they say in the US. The trainers were poor, and one of them was offensive and rude, particularly to older members of the team who were having trouble picking up the software. I ended up assisting, as I had used the software extensively before and had an affinity for technology. I managed to defuse the situation, (aforementioned trainer was going to get punched).


Afterwards, I fed back to my manager what I thought of the training (awful). He challenged me to do better. I had some good feedback from the team, and was already mentoring new starters, so I thought – why not? I was convinced I could not do any worse. 


Our contract with the training provider was not renewed, and there was a training gap, so I volunteered to deliver a course. I had no idea really what I was doing, I only resolved to do two things: Ensure everyone learned everything they needed to, and treat everyone in the room with dignity.  


It went brilliantly, and I loved it. It caught me by surprise, I am normally a very quiet and reserved person, so public speaking in front of colleagues should have terrified me, but it didn’t. My parents had warned me off education as a career prospect early on, as they were both teachers and said there was no money in it. In the Public Sector, this was (is?) certainly true. I was determined to do make this work however, and decided to do some research. 

*What if there was some way I could combine something I was good at (technology), with some I actually cared about (education), and not take a pay cut in the process?*


*Technical Training* was what I found, and that is what I do now.


Of course, I was only half way there, I had found a potential career, but I wasn’t actually doing it yet. I applied for some Training Roles, but got no responses. It became evident that I needed the experience. It was at this point I had another knockback, and a blow to my confidence. My Manager set me with a meeting with our HoD. My mission was to convince him that our department needed a full-time trainer, and that I was that person. I was naïve however, and didn’t realise that what I needed was a bulletproof business justification – this was after all, a penny counting operational department. For all intents and purposes, I was laughed out of the room. Awful moment for me.


I didn’t give up. My company was big enough that we had our own training department, and I kept my eyes open for job opportunities there. I wanted nothing left to chance - when an opportunity came up I wanted to be 1st in line. To that end, I volunteered for every training delivery opportunity possible. I dressed professionally so trainees felt they were getting a “paid for” experience (they weren’t). I did my very best to ensure the training was fun and engaging, everyone left the training room armed with what they needed to know, and I made sure they felt 10 feet tall. I created an online community using our corporate intranet, recording and uploaded lots of tutorial videos to it which people found useful. At this point some of my colleagues thought I was a suck-up, but I didn’t care, I was too far invested and had a plan.


I played the long game. It took maybe 6-9 months of this, but my reputation grew. Managers from over the country started asking for me specifically to deliver training, and they negotiated with my Line Manager to free me up from my day job so I could.


Eventually, I got the attention of the training department, and I interviewed for the next available position as a Technical Trainer. They were very impressed with the work I had done on my own, and sought feedback from the people I trained – which (I assume) must have been positive. My strategy had worked, I was the person they wanted!


After the interview process, I was offered the role - at 15% less than my current salary. To train people to do the role that I was currently in. I went from elation to disappointment in a heartbeat. Another awful moment. My Wife and I were saving every penny for a house deposit, and there was no way we could take that kind of income hit. 


Despite all the hard work getting me to this point, I had to tell them no, I could not accept a base salary cut. I needed them to counter. It was a gamble, and one of the most difficult conversations I have ever had.  


It was a calculated gamble though. I was miles ahead of the other candidates, and I deliberately left salary negotiation as late as possible in the process in case they low balled me. I figured, the longer they went without completing the hire, the stronger my negotiating position became. Especially if they made the foolish move of informing the unsuccessful candidates before I formally accepted.


Unbeknown to me, this also paid off. The hiring Manager became desperate, and drove for half a day to the HR Directors Office to convince her that he needed me for the job. He was successful, and had a whole new job band created just for me, so they could pay my current salary.


**Success!!!** Everything up until this point took about 2.5 years.


For the next 2.5 years, I set about learning my new field. My story is already pretty long, but I need to mention that this part was also quite difficult. I enjoyed the work for sure, and was good at it – but going from the guy who knows everything, to the guy who knows nothing was tough. Learning from people 10 years my junior, reporting to people 5 years my junior. It was humbling, even a bit depressing at times.


I did a lot of graft however, learned everything I could, as fast as I could. I had fantastic professional development opportunities too. As a result, I outgrew the role. Now armed with a whole lot of relevant experience in my CV, I recently started a new job, in a new company, in a more senior role and I finally feel like the change has been a success. 


If you have made it this far, you can imagine it was a long road. There is actually a lot I have left out, but this post is already too long, so I’ll just say thank you for reading and if you have any questions I am more than happy to answer.


**TLDR:**

-	Use any research method you can think of to find something that you both have an affinity for, and care about.

-	Find a practical way to go about making a change.

-	Don’t give up when you experience setbacks.

How we ultimately decide what our motives and intents are at every turn and section of the day help to make up our life. Life is just a journey of wrong decisions, right decisions, bad choices, good choices, and missed opportunities. 

I've always wanted to make the right decision. The right decision for me is the one that progresses me, and opens up doors to my future. But the reasons I associate as a right decision are different from how another person might see their ""right decision.""

390,cxcqia,False,None,50,Stable job I like ($50k) or risky job I love ($70k)?,careerguidance,"Stable job I **like** ($50k) or risky job I **love** ($72k)?

First, I’m 40.

I’m currently at a **stable job** (technically no job is stable I know), in a position I’m comfortable in, with a boss that likes me and would fight for me (and says he has plans for me with the company), in a company that has been around for 20 years, with decent benefits & flexibility (periodic paid lunches, somewhat flexible schedule, etc), I literally have 0 complaints about this job. Job is even easy too, I don’t see myself ever getting fired and could be there for years to come (won’t love it, but won’t hate it, it's nice, I like it)... It’s stable.

But there’s another **risky job** that pays more ($72k vs $50k) in an industry I’m super passionate about… but there’s risk because it’s a startup company, in an industry where others didn't make it, so it may not be around in 3-5 years.

It’s typically easy for me to make hard decisions, but this one has just got me torn. Everything is pointing to taking the high paying job doing something I love, but the uncertainty of the future is making me 2nd guess myself. And I would hate to burn a bridge with my current employee.

Any advice here? And if it helps, here’s some background about me:

**ASL**: 40/m/Idaho  
**Debt**: $70k left in mortgage, $7k left on car, $7k left in Credit Cards  
**Kids**: No  
**Married**: Yes, she doesn’t work

395,d1p0md,False,None,80,Stuck in a job that's ruining my health & job search is hopeless. What do I do now?,careerguidance,"I've been an admin assistant for 4 years now. It was fine at first, but I've been struggling in it for over a year. I'm 26F and educated with a Bachelor's Degree. I've outgrown this job because all I do is copy papers and clean the office. The commute takes an hour even though it's only a few miles (traffic is horrendous). They pay is low and I get no health insurance benefits. I've developed IBS and my depression has gotten worse due to the stress of it all. The long commute, low pay, and disorganized management. My boss always gives me last minute work in the last 15 minutes of the day that needs done immediately. I sit there doing almost nothing all day, even though I ask for work to do they say ""We don't have anything right now"". They wait until the last minute and it's stressing me out so bad. I also can't sleep more than 5 hours a night and it's agonizing.

I've been applying for jobs since January and only got a call back from a receptionist position at a hair salon nearby. It was a joke I applied to it because I figured a crap job would call me back and they did. I've been applying for jobs one step above admin assistant, because I don't want to do this anymore, but I've heard nothing.

I've met with my uni's career department for help and they worked with me. They said my resume and cover letters were great. But they've left it up to me to apply for jobs (I wish they would be recommend me somewhere). Applying online is hopeless and I have no connections.

I still live at home since I have no money to live on my own, so it's financially okay for me to quit the current job and work harder at finding another one, except I pay full price for health insurance. But my parents don't have extra money and consistently need my financial help. We all work together just to keep an apartment and buy food and pay bills, paycheck to paycheck. I write freelance for some websites so I can use that to explain the gap in my employment. I'd like the most to write for a living, but working full time doesn't give me enough free time to pursue it. I've considered part time work, but I will probably need a job that provides health benefits.

I'm scared to quit because I'll lose income to pay for health insurance. I can't afford the penalty at tax season. I'm completely miserable and depressed and hopeless.

396,cx4nr2,False,None,61,I've been repeatedly told I'm doomed and hopeless after being out of the workforce for 16 years. Is this really true? [ pls no bully :( I come in total peace and humility ],careerguidance,"Thanks for clicking on my post!

So here's some information for you in case you're willing to point me in some useful directions. Thanks in advance for reading and thinking about a stranger's troubles and foibles.

I have a foreign degree in economics but I don't remember any of the coursework and I'm not good at it anyway. I wasn't good at economic theory and belief systems back then either. Plus I had little to no idea about what to do during exams because the questions made little sense to me. I was far better at understanding business and some finance concepts from a few of the classes I had to take. I grasped them intuitively much better than my classmates who did well at economics.

I haven't worked in 16 years. I'm afraid I will not be getting into the how and why of how this transpired. Please rest assured however that there is no incarceration or any other type of untoward/illegal/immoral/scandalous issue involved whatsoever.

What I have been doing - as and when I could - is taking many for-credit courses online at community colleges and a local 4 year college. I've been taking them as a non-degree seeking student. These classes have been in business and law, as well as in art and design. I have also taken non-college non-credit classes in art. I have excelled at all these classes.

My past jobs, before the 16 year period of unemployment, involved customer service and low-level admin work. I realized that I have a peculiar talent for observation of customer behavior and a strong curiosity about its patterns, going so far as to conduct little sensory experiments to see what customers responded to. I also found myself fixing hold-ups in customer service and employee performance with little basic solutions such as a flow-chart, behind the counter for the cashiers, that described types of glitches that the ancient cash machine would throw at us while checking out a customer and how to work around those glitches. 

Ideally, if I had the money and time that I needed, I would be studying human perception and sensory processing, and applying it toward usability, UI/UX work, interaction design, service design, customer experience design etc. But alas, I do not have that time and/or money :/ I am curious about studying these fields in Germany though given its free education and the quality of German design. But since I have no idea how to get there, it remains a total fantasy at this point.

What I can do as proven by the coursework I've excelled at:

- Write a fairly decent essay

- Analyze a given situation fairly decently

- Grasp legal concepts and apply them to scenarios (while being unable to memorize - please see section below)

- Understand at least fairly well how the fields of business and law work with each other

- Understand visual composition 

- Convey visual information

- Take on complicated topics in business, science and design and find a way to synthesize them and produce a fairly decent design product
 
This semester I will be learning how to write a business plan.

What I CANNOT do:

- Drive

- Stand for longer than 30 minutes. Walking is totally fine.

- Lift heavy objects

- Do math calculations quickly or in my head

- Memorize a ton of stuff and recall it quickly

- Speak Spanish - which in my town at least is a definite requirement for any and all menial jobs and even many white-collar low-level jobs

CAVEATS:

- The law classes have NOT been from any law school and I'm NOT working towards a JD or any paralegal certification. (Should I?) They're from community colleges.

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in design software such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator etc. 

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in commonly used office software like MS Office.

If you've read thus far, here are some questions:

- Ideally I would have a remote/online part-time job.  What fields would such jobs fall under? What skills do such jobs often require?

- What should I learn in the short term so I have basic job skills for a white-collar job? 

(I'm not seeking white-collar out of classism or snobbery, please see 'What I CANNOT do section' above)

- What should I aim for in the long term so that I can build career skills while I work a part-time job?

- What kind of job should I be looking for while I build larger, long-term career skills?

- Do you have any pointers on what type of career I should go for? 

CODING BOOTCAMP:

At this point, it seems like standard advice to tell someone to 'get into' a coding bootcamp. Is this a reasonable course of action for someone like me?

I am 32 Years old and have just been fired today.  I was fired for an incident that occurred 7-8 years ago.   This topic is not about why i was fired so i will just leave it at that.

I have been with this company for my entire adult life. Part time while in university, and full time immediately after graduation.  8-9 years working there full time.  You could say its a government job where most people who work there stay for life, and that was my plan as well.

I have a degree in Finance and graduated in 2010,  it was difficult to find work in my field back then, and I had the opportunity to get a decent paying job out of school so I took it.

I started as a cleaner and took a few relevant courses to become a technician/mechanic within the company.  Sadly these courses do not qualify me for anything outside of my previous work. 

Now I am unemployed, and the only education I have is finance degree from a decade ago with zero relevant experience, and some random trade courses my previous employer decided were relevant.  Essentially zero technical qualifications.



**I have no idea what I want to do with my life at this point.**  I am recently married, and we had our first child 2 months ago, so the timing could not have been worse.  But I do have several months to a year worth of funds saved.

I am open to trying anything really, from going back to school, to starting my own business.
My previous work was easy but brain dead and I did not really enjoy my time there, it was just to pay the bills.  
I'm hoping this time around it can be different.


A few things about me.

* I'm a nerd, logical, introvert, somewhat interested in technology, and I play alot of games.

* I am no good at things like cold calling, sales, public speaking, and grammar. 

* I consider myself a fairly capable individual.  And I am confident if given the chance I can excel in whatever position I apply for.  I just need the opportunity 



Some fields I've considered (but know nothing or very little about)

* Gaming related

* IT related job

* Finance related 




Any extra schooling I go for would have to be a relatively short/fast tracked?  As I cannot afford to go back to school for 4 years.


Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, 
for example, the IT field is huge, what sort of courses should I take?  How much money will I make?

Obviously i want to make the most money possible.  For reference I made ~75k at my previous job


Thank you in advance.





EDIT:   Thanks to everyone for all the replies.  I made this post less then 4 hours after getting let go, and did not expect so many replies.

The basic coding course might be a nice idea. You must be proactive and positive. Have you called Union Pacific to see if there are any current vacancies or not? What about a move to a new city? That might boost your employment chances significantly as well.

406,c2opo9,False,None,32,Had a serious panic attack at work. Is this a good time to jump off?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

I'm 26 (M) and I've been working as an analyst in a bank for 1 and a half years. It's a stressful job, we take a lot of shit from different people. The internal policies are ridiculous, they treat us like children, the work is incredibly tedious and repetitive, and honestly there doesn't seem to be much room for growth (the higher up jobs look unbearable). 

We have about two managers per analyst... And all that the managers do is discuss projects that never happen, fight over the holiday schedule, or convince us that we don't need to get paid for overtime.

I want out, I want to change industries all together. I have about 3 months savings at the moment and I was thinking of sucking it up for a few months while I applied to schools and saved some more.

But I have an anxiety disorder which stems from PTSD. I've kept my anxiety and depression on the down low at work, even though I know that my job enhances my symptoms. I've been muscling through, sometimes it gets really hard and I hide in the bathroom.

Today, while I was chatting with my manager, I suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe. Then I felt like I was going to die. I couldn't stand straight. Suddenly there was an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital. They had me there for three hours or so... At the end I just started crying.

Right now I'm at home trying to process what just happened. I'm terrified of going back to work tomorrow. I'm terrified that this might happen again. I don't want to go back. Is this a good time to jump off? Can I say I need to take this time to focus on my mental health and have a look at other options?

How can I finally leave it behind?!,careerguidance,"I recently (last day was 2 weeks ago) quit my very well paying Logistics Coordinator job. I have a couple of months of rent saved up , will be starting school next week (video editing and production) at a local community college (very low cost) and already have a part time job lined up at a local restaurant.

However, as happy as I am to be pursuing something I’ve always wanted to do and chase after my dreams. The “logical” side of my brain which chooses the money is going nuts. Mind you, there is no way I will go back to Logistics, I’ve grown to hate the job and the repetitiveness of it. I worked at one of the best logistics companies in the world with great benefits an awesome team and good pay. None of this was enough as I simply no longer had any interest in it. I was basically dragging myself out of bed every morning and had become anxiety ridden and depressed feeling as if I was just slowly rotting in my cubicle.

I am actually excited for the restaurant job even though it will only pay a fraction of my old job because its something different . But I know I want to make more money than I did before. Not to mention, I will need a steady income to buy equipment and build my media company as I grow my skills.

Again, lots of people have asked why I didnt stay at my old job amd went to school at the same time. With 55+ hours of work a week and my hate towards the job it was just not possible. I wanted out . So going back to that is simply not an option . If rather struggle with part times until I find something else than go back to it.

With that said. I am 31 now and have been working since age 17. Ive been a delivery driver, warehouse supervisor, got a BA in Psychology, have some experience in sales and worked as a logistics coordinator for the last 7 years.

Nonetheless, right now I dont have kids a mortgage or any debt. But my savings aren’t huge either just enough to get by for about 4-5 months plus whatever I make on the part time.

Ive looked into e-commerce and drop-shipping since I have extensive experience with imports from Asia and Europe due to my work in logistics. However, that industry really seems like a gamble and I dont have money to spare/throw away in hopes of getting lucky.

I do speak spanish fluently and have no trouble befriended and talking to people so there’s that as well.

Also if you have a BS i would not say going back to a 4 year or masters is the best thing because masters are pretty expensive.  I went to a committee college for 2 years and that worked out well although it was too easy given my education (if i could have gotten it done in 1 semester I would have).

If it were me though, knowing what I know now, i'd get back into your field with an actual exit plan, instead of just quitting and hoping something strikes you.  You need funds and indicating that you only have 4-5 months of emergency funds, given no kids or mortgage, means you didn't save nearly enough for a career transition.  It took me about 3 years to go back to my old salary, which was only 40k, and it took 5 years to get above that.

Ever since I can remember I've been a super curious, knowledge-seeking person which I think helped me alot in certain aspects of my life but it makes deciding which courses to take in college and what my career path will look like a nightmare...

For some background, I just turned 20 (today's my birthday!) and I'm currently in my second year of a bachelor's in Computer Science. I chose Computer Science mainly because it would allow me to get a job pretty much anywhere in the world but I don't particularly LOVE it. I'm quite interested in Psychology, Neuroscience, History,  Philosophy but also some Politics and some aspects of engineering. I'm not super extroverted but I'm also not an introvert, I like to be around people and sometimes even talk in public to a lot of people but other times I just wanna be alone for a whole weekend.

I feel like people can rely on me and I would do well on a managerial position but I'm unsure since I don't have any job experience.  I love learning about diferent cultures and how they go about their day, including traditions, ideas, how they view the world etc, so having a job that somehow included that would be amazing (although maybe hard to obtain).

I immediately went into academic research for a few years (ecology, botany, and molecular bio/cancer research), but then was laid off due to lack of funding. I decided to take my savings and go to West Africa where I ended up informally teaching science in a local grade school for a year. After that, I had the travel bug and spent the rest of my 20's basically working in food service so I could have funds to travel. I've been to 35 or so countries and did volunteer farming or other odds and ends, but nothing too involved or for too long. I mostly just enjoyed myself.

And preferably not require 8 hours a day, or 40 hours a week, but I wouldn’t be unwilling to spend that much time since the benefit would be getting to be at home by myself.

Disclaimer, I’m 24, but a social anomaly, and my family’s abuse and being financially unable to support myself makes me socially withdrawal even more.

I’m kind of relieved school has been moved online (because of the pandemic that mentioning gets people banned and demonetized in the case of YouTubers) because socially, I was getting nowhere.

I’m a college freshman at 24 years old, who sucks at driving (recently failed the test) and completely dependent on my parents to not be homeless. 

I couldn’t even get the pills I require to function on a basic level if it weren’t for being on my parent’s health insurance (I live in the United States, no Universal Healthcare here), which I will be legally forced off when I turn 26. If I lost access I could literally end up another crazy homeless person, and no offense to anyone (I know some really are just down on their luck) but I would rather kill myself than be homeless (also because I’ve already been abused and miserable my whole life)

I suffer from OCD, ADD, and more recently, severe anxiety, depression, and until my psychiatrist added another medication, near-violent rage (I can’t function at all without medication, and I’m still not a functional adult).

I hate my job, but I am very grateful to have it (especially throughout the whole pandemic, because many people have lost their jobs) and virtually always go in, no matter how bad I feel, because I know that being unemployed is 100x worse.

I literally just bag groceries, get grocery carts from a parking lot, and restock returned items. Sad part is, I started in a regular department, where I was even initially told that I was doing good, then that quickly turned into me being “too slow” and “missing too many details”.

I do not want any handouts, even if I am legally entitled, I’m already ashamed enough, and relying on others to survive is a TERRIBLE feeling, the fact that I rely on my own parents makes it somewhat more bearable, but I still get let know that I’m “past my time”, sure, I contribute to some things, but that’s such a small percentage of full living costs, my parents work very hard (I know life is hard, one of my biggest mistakes was growing up believing life was easy and just happened by itself).

I had internet friends, but withdrew myself because it felt pointless talking to people I’d never see. I also swore off LDRs, because I’d never get to see any of those girls/women in real life, even if I could, I can’t afford actual living costs, and even if she’s one of those women who takes care of her man (nothing wrong with that if it’s ok for a man to take care of a woman) I don’t want my livelihood dependent on anybody but myself.

If I have a girlfriend and we break up, I at least shouldn’t have to worry about being broke or homeless.

I’m willing to work, but it eats me up inside everyday, doing a job that nobody actually needs done (or at least takes virtually no skill to do whatsoever), having people treating me like I’m slow (stop calling me buddy unless you’re Canadian!) automatically seeing my job position, and feeling unworthy of any social interaction, if I befriended anyone, it wouldn’t be long before the questions start about my lifestyle, and I will be judged, negatively.

I have too many mental issues, emotional, even physical (some may or may not be caused from medication), and now I’m plagued with insecurity, and despite desperately wanting to break dependence on my family, lack of motivation to do anything.

OK, I do have motivation and interests, they’re just not very strong or consistent, nothing is really THAT INTERESTING, if it is, the interest won’t last long, until it’s just another memory that’s no longer associated with pleasure.

Other reasons working from home would be nice, more dependent on myself (well, if I’m self-employed, which would be true financial freedom, or at least as close to possible as it), less forced socializing means more energy, less anxiety (I’ve literally resisted a panic attack to run out of the building, although that was the first day of a job, and it was better as soon as the second day, although it was seasonal and they let me go after the season), and hell, this whole pandemic is reason enough to work from home if possible. 

I was never meant to be a social extrovert, if I can have any social and/or dating life, I don’t want it to be too much. 

It’s hard to feel any worth or value from doing work that you don’t feel purpose from, especially when you have nothing else, or nobody else, to live for outside of a job. 

Even if I don’t have to be a complete social hermit (I’ve come so close to becoming a complete misanthropist due to how I’m treated, and resisted falling into the cult of inceldom and misogyny, when I manage to avoid hatred, my perspective just leaves me with confusion) it’d still be nice to be able to work from home, and make not driving even easier (that’s caused so many issues for me, and I’ve spent so much on Uber and now risking catch the you know what, and some mentally unstable guy almost drove into incoming traffic with me as a rider!)

*Sigh*

Even when I’m told how much I’m appreciated and how good a job I do, I feel like worthless garbage, because that’s not a real accomplishment for somebody my age, I should have a REAL ADULT JOB and be living on my own, supporting myself.

I’m not worried about supporting a family (why the hell would I want to create kids against their will who could suffer just like I have? That’s assuming any woman even wanted to do that with me) but feel I need to make a lot of money just for myself, for freedom, because true freedom only exists with a lot of money. I’ve never felt free, yet my family claims that “Democrat socialists” will take our freedom away, especially because “socialism is the first step leading to communism”. 

Well ONE, I think America needs a better social safety net and PROGRESSION (we should strive to be like Denmark, the happiest nation on Earth, me may have a much bigger country, but we also have more wealth to cover it) and TWO, I’ve never felt freedom anyway.

The closest I ever got to freedom almost left me homeless, that hurt my sense of competence even more. Being told I’m stupid for trying doesn’t feel like freedom, and being stranded from running out of savings certainly doesn’t feel like freedom.

I was told to try and change my situation if I was so miserable, and when I tried just that, my family told me how wrong it was and that I needed to go back to sitting at home, and I ran out of savings from motel rooms and applying to basic jobs, ending up staying with other family and relying on government assistance just to eat!

420,98py11,False,None,67,How do I accept that I have to work the rest of my life?,careerguidance,"Hey all I didn't really know how to put the title but I'm a 25 year old and I am really struggling to wrap my mind around working my whole life still.

I've been working since I was 16 and have had quite a few different jobs since then ranging from a couple months to 3-4 years.

I recently started a job that is actually gonna set me up pretty comfortably for the future but I just cannot get used to the idea that I will be working the rest of my life. I have felt this way through all my jobs and family and friends say to suck it up this is how life gets but I just can't accept it.

I spend my whole days working and use my weekend to do nothing productive then feel bad on sundays when I have to go back to work on monday. The problem is when I dont do anything on the weekend i just usually game out and not really do anything. But even when I have weekend plans and spend the weekend away from home I don't feel relaxed. In fact I haven't found anything to occupy my times on weekends that makes me feel okay with going back to work.

I then get into this cycle of where I just can't stand it anymore and quit my job because of all the pressure.

All I can think of when im at work is coming home to game or hang out with people and then when my weekend comes all I can think about is all the million things I want to do and would rather do than go to work next week.


I have tried to use my own time to do things I am interested in but my job is quite physical and I spend most my time recovering on weekends and after work when my hobbies include exercising or being active.

90 percent of the jobs I have worked have all been physical jobs and I really don't want this to be the rest of my life. I have no real college or university experience I don't know what to do really.

I have tried talking to Councillors and work on bettering myself but after a few months I always feel the same way I do now and I really wish I could feel better about life. 

Sorry if this seems like a jumbled mess, just trying to work this off my chest.

424,fo246f,False,None,85,Can't get any kind of job. What happens to people like me?,careerguidance,"I'm in my early-mid twenties and I've never had a job.

Without getting into too much detail, I've had a problem throughout my entire life which had disallowed me from participating effectively in any kind of institutional setting. I would summarize the problem by saying that I can't deal with ambiguity. In school, I would sometimes not turn in work that I had already done because I wasn't exactly sure where or how to turn it in, and I was too afraid to ask. That's an extreme case, but I had lots of other smaller issues like that. Not sure of how to do some kind of project that they provided little to no information on the specifics of. I'm sure people can relate, but the difference between you and me is that you seem to be able to bs your way through it and find some way to figure out what they're trying to ask you to do.

I was homeschooled for a lot of my life, and my problems with ambiguous instructions began in 4th grade where I attended a public school for the first time. I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I generally lack common sense in a lot of areas, leading to various other problems functioning. I would go into more detail but it seems unnecessary for now. The basic point I'm trying to make is that I can't deal with normal institutional scenarios. I'm pretty intelligent and pretty talented in some areas, but when an obligation presents itself in the form of an institution, that's when I can't deal with it. I don't want to deal with it but I also can't. Somehow, when a bunch of bureaucrats or a bunch of profiteers get involved in some sort of activity, they turn the activity itself into a secondary goal. The main goal is to fulfill the bureaucracy's requirements, or to suck up to the right people, or to help your boss make profit. No one wants me to do some task for the sake of simply doing the task, and I think the spirit of that situation is just very difficult for me to function in, and the ambiguous instructions that come up in that situation are just the cherry on top, guaranteeng that I won't be able to do what the job is asking. As an example, I'm somewhat talented at computer security, and I enjoy messing around on my own with it, but in an employment scenario, instead of just doing what needs to be done, I'm suddenly gonna have to write a report, and present a slideshow, or some other bureaucratic garbage which as I said, is designed to fulfill some need other than the immediate requirements of the job, which is where I struggle.

So anyway, just to finish my history. I went to middle school until I left in the 7th grade when I dropped out and became homeschooled again, which didn't actually entail much official schooling. I mostly just educated myself on stuff I happened to be interested in. My parents knew I couldn't take public school anymore. I went to a community college during the time that I was finishing up my homeschooling time. It took me over five years but eventually I got a associates degree and in college I suffered from all the same problems I laid out before. But I did get the degree. It's useless for me however.

So, I'm now in a situation where I've kind of accepted that I can't get a job. If I were to go to an interview, I'd be far too awkward and unable to follow the instructions during the interview, both in preparation for it and in terms of answering the questions during it. Secondly, if I did ever get a job somehow, I'd be fired within a couple weeks as soon as the employers see that I can't perform. My parents have been understanding to some degree and have supported me up until now, but our financial situation is much tighter now and I really want to try and help out, even though I know I can't.

I would say that the only job I could really get would be some kind of job where the boss tells you exactly what to do and there's no reading between the lines whatsoever. For example, the boss says ""take this shovel and move these rocks from this pile into that pile."" I can do that, but even with manual labor, a lot of it is too difficult for me to interpret what they're asking me to do. Does anyone have any advice on what I should try to do? I basically just want some kind of manual labor job (not dissing manual labor at all here, just to be clear) where I don't really have to engage in deep thought about what's going on. I was thinking maybe some kind of assembly line job could be possible. I really want to try and find something here, but I don't really think there's a specific job that allows for simple manual labor like that. Do such jobs exist, and if so, what sort of titles would they be under and how might I apply for it? I I just wonder what happens to people like me sometimes. I mean what if I can't get any kind of job? I live in the US and we have basically no welfare state whatsoever. Especially since I've never had a job, they won't give me anything. I guess I'm just gonna be homeless, but I think I might have missed some kind of opportunity in the form of a simple, manual labor job that doesn't require previous experience in carpentry or construction or anything like that, and that doesn't require any of the thinking on your feet that I'm so bad at.

427,ca2zqr,False,None,17,How do you deal with performance reviews and goal setting when you no longer care about your job?,careerguidance,"I am going in for my annual goal setting and performance review this week with my line manager. 


I’ve been at this company for about 2.5 years, but my heart has never been in it. I took the job for the money. I moved from client-side back to consulting.


Though I’ve been looking for a new role elsewhere since I started the job, (and gotten a few offers over this duration), I liked my coworkers and wanted to give it an honest try.  TBH, it wasn’t going so badly. 


Then at the start of 2019, there was a leadership change both at CEO level, and Regional Director (RD) for my geography.  It’s been a massive cultural shift, especially in our region where the new RD was brought in from a competitor with a very different business approach.  It’s a very poor cultural alignment. 


Now there is lots of alienation among the existing leadership cohort as new RD brings in his team from his past company. Of course these new joiners all have a similar cultural approach.  It’s getting pretty toxic all around as several of us know we are being setup to exit the business. 


I’m not immune.  My role is being redefined under this new regime. RD no longer wants me in a region-wide team leadership and oversight role, he just wants me to focus on my city, hands on with projects. It’s great that I won’t have to travel so much, but it feels like a demotion, not the next step to long term success.


HQ (on another continent) loves my work so far and has offered me additional equity in the company. I have great support back there and my overall salary situation is fantastic. As the new RD seems to be pushing me out the door, the award of equity feels like a mind-f**k.


I’m eager to move on, but golden handcuffs are tough to shake off.  I need to do the best I can where I am at until I find another landing spot. 


So what to say in the goal setting?  I’m totally unengaged, disinterested, and resentful. 


I know playing it too candidly isn’t the right thing, even though my line manager is equally disaffected by the organisational transformation that surrounds us. 


Any suggestions on how to do this dance would be appreciated.

Third, what about personal development? Think of your next job, and a skill that you'd need on the job there that you have yet to possess/perfect. There's your personal goal, and when you're working on it, you're taking time at your current job preparing you to be more successful at your next one. Win win. ",2019-07-07 04:33:21

The first 3 years of my career I worked abroad. Just over a year ago I moved back home. I'm currently at my 5th employer after changing jobs a few time because of moving between cities but also because of a few very bad experiences where I didn't like/hated my job. I've worked at a wide variety of companies as a data analyst/market researcher, from scale-ups to some of the world's largest advisory firms. The pay has always been very good. Currently, I'm working at a bank.

Everywhere around me I see people being super engaged with the company/job. They appear to be what some call ""passionate"". The problem is that I've never been satisfied (or passionate) with any of the jobs I had. The first few months I'm super excited getting to know the company, the people, and learn the ropes. However, after a few months that feeling fades and I start to think about what to do next. 

This has resulted in things like casually looking on LinkedIn for jobs, getting hooked on the idea of starting my own business from home (e.g., dropshipping, starting a blog, and much more have passed) but never really going for it, focusing on hobbies hoping to make a living out of it and working om my technical skills (actually useful for my career).

It's not that I hate my job or that I wake up every day dreading going to work; it just not fulfills me to the same extent as it does for the ""passionate"" people.

Should I quit my job?,careerguidance,"I'm  the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job  alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I  interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exhausted.

I  work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee  who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing,  taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so  many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have  to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning  of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new  clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes  they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of  all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9  p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common (or  not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the  company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My  worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing  to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my  whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really  overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called  to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides  all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been  fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So  I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of  what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* restless
* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying really, really easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgetting any information
* walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxious

I  asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel  better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I  tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did  was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my feelings.

I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle this?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

I got laid off due to COVID and I’m wondering how to best prepare for the post COVID opportunities. I have time now to sharpen some skills.

Background:
Bachelors in Economics

I got dragged into the tech world a few years ago (after several years of completely unrelated experience).

During the period of employment, I started working more and more in tech related roles. It was a start up and so I wore several different hats. 

Here is a rough breakdown of responsibilities:

- 5% QA (writing test cases, assigning tickets, creating QA timelines)

- 15% Product management (wireframe, get client requirements, talk and design with engineers)

- 30% operations (writing SQL queries - Oracle/SQL server, building tableau dashboards) 

- 30% data analytics (creating segments, data cleaning, regressions - mostly in Excel, R)

- 20% random stuff 

Questions:

1)Out of these, which do you believe has a higher earning potential over time?

Data Analyst 

Product management/BA

Operations Analyst 

2)How important is it to get IT qualifications / certificates to be employed by larger companies?

1. Please keep filling apps on indeed and walking into local places for apps, and then quit this job. Nomatter what you do, it will be different, probably pay more, and have less hours.
2. It's never too late to seek a medical diagnosis for your introvertedness. It is likely a symptom of something greater like AVPD, CPTSD, or autism spectrum related. in fact, if you're an introvert in your 50's, and it is interfering with your career, there is an undeniably strong chance of it . I just recently read a post of a 58 y/o newly diagnosed man. I think this would be helpful to you to receive needed help. You are not helping yourself nor your mom by avoiding diagnosis and torturing yourself.
3. Also, this may be hard to hear, but: Your mom, inspite of her best intentions, did not properly prepare you for a successful life. Instead of encouraging you and genuinely pushing and helping you every day to go out and date and get married and have a family of your own, she may have inadvertently stunted your social and emotional growth. Who is going to be there for you when she gets older and passes? What children will look after your wellbeing, if you got none? Been there done that.

439,cd6hno,False,None,76,"35 y/o, $500K~ net worth, Senior Manager in tech... but no degree and having a hard time advancing further. Is an online BA + MBA worth it at my age, or should I invest in other ways?",careerguidance,"**TL:DR is in the title.**

35 years old, attended college for 5-6 years but never finished a degree. About 15-20 hours away, but haven't enrolled anywhere since 2008-09.

Ran a small business for a while, had other jobs, then in 2011 got into a niche online streaming industry very early and had success. Eventually became a founding member (but not an owner) of a start-up company in Silicon Valley that was later acquired by a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in the world. That happened four years.

Since that time, have worked my way up internally to Senior Manager ($160-170K), was on track for Director by end of this year ($200-220K), but unfortunately a new boss was hired from the East Coast and he and I are no simpatico. No demotion, but was involuntarily reassigned to a smaller role, managing 20% of the people I used to, all remote. It's time to go.

Due to my background and experience in what it still a relatively niche part of the industry, expected to be able to make a non-lateral move relatively easily. Was very wrong. No callbacks at all for Director+ level positions, only Senior Manager level positions. Have gone deep into the process in a few, but no offer yet but expecting one next week... but it'll be for a Senior Manager position with only a modest (10-20% pay increase). Have become convinced this is the result of a lack of a degree, especially an MBA, which those who were eventually hired into the best positions I sought had in common.

Currently engaged to be married next year and living together, household income of around $260K in the Bay Area, around $400K in stock and $100K in other investments tucked away. We're comfortable and stable.

Here's the question: At my age, does it make sense to sell about $150K in stock for me to complete an online degree at my former university (they offer Reagent Bachelor of Arts degrees (RBA) specifically for people in my situation) and then enroll at a top 10 online MBA school (most likely USC)? Or would I be better off letting that money grow, using it to fund other FIRE oriented projects, etc? Are online MBA's worth it? Or am I misguided in believing they're the big difference maker in breaking through to Director+ level?

Long term goal is to bank away $2MM minimum, $4MM optimum to retire as early as possible. How I get there doesn't matter to me.

Do I stick with what I went to school for or chase my childhood dream?",careerguidance,"I had my 23rd birthday this week, which was also almost six months to the day since I graduated from college with a degree in video production. In these past six months I have done essentially nothing with my life. It has been a constant mental battle trying to figure out just where exactly I fit in the real world. I'm torn between potential career paths and paralyzed with fear that I won't make the right choice.

While I certainly enjoyed my production classes and learning about the world of media in college it was never what I set out to learn at the start. I began my college career as an engineering student, but difficulties with my school's math classes forced me to change my major after my freshman year. I changed to the ""university studies"" major, which is a nice way of saying undecided, and floated around taking business, sociology, and media classes before the deadline for me to declare a major. I chose media production because it was what I enjoyed most of the areas I had studied, and because it reminded me of the fun I had doing the lighting for school plays in high school. But I honestly have no desire to spend the rest of my days editing news clips or sports highlights.

My true passion has always been cars. I've spent countless hours since I was young researching and learning about cars, and different ways to maintain and modify them. I always wanted to have a project car, and eventually become a mechanic but my parents wanted me to drive something safe and new, and to get a bachelors degree so I could get a ""real job."" Now I finally have a project car, but I'm too afraid to do anything with it because I've had the idea that I shouldn't waste my time and money on cars drilled into my brain by my family. They are also very white collar, and whenever I bring up the idea of becoming a mechanic again it is almost always dismissed for reasons such as ""you won't make enough money to support a family."" 

So what do I do? I need to start working soon at this point, because I want to start moving forward with other aspects of adult life like saving to move out of my mom's house, and dating (which I have not had much luck with since I'm unemployed and live with my mother obviously). I enjoy video production, but I'm not passionate about it like I am with cars. However, I actually have some background with videography whereas I have very little hands on automotive experience, and I would likely have to start out doing oil and tire changes for around $10/hour before I could move up to a full mechanic position. Either way I'd probably only make around $30-40k a year in the end whether I am a video editor or working as a mechanic at a dealership.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c60c82/im_23_i_graduated_college_six_months_ago_and_im/,135,Don’t be dumb.

&#x200B;

I always enjoyed being creative, and while I never planned to go I made a last minute decision to go to university to study BA Games Art, and graduated with a 2:2. I consider it to be an essentially useless qualification that isn't particularly useful, and something that I was never good enough at to seriously pursue anyway.

&#x200B;

After university I fell into a customer service call centre environment, then after nearly 3 years I joined a software company working in sales. I wasn't terrible at it, but the constant stress and pressure made me dread it everyday. Still, I stuck it out for nearly 3 years and found myself in a position where I could take a year off and travel, with the idea I'd do some soul searching and ""find myself"".

&#x200B;

Now I'm back, I've joined another smaller software company as an account manager, although there is no sales element here. As I sit here writing this, I'm kinda terrified that I still don't know what I'm doing. I can't really see much room for progression in this career path, except into more sales type roles, which I know I don't want to do. As I get older money is becoming more important to me as I find I can barely afford to rent let alone think about getting any assets of my own.

&#x200B;

I find myself looking at posts online about retraining, going back to university, starting again a whole new career - but I don't have the first idea about how to do that.

&#x200B;

Maybe life isn't everything you want right now, but look at all the awesome stuff you've done. I'm sorry you regret your degree, and to be blunt, you are right, it probably won't be that helpful on the job market. That is the risk of being an artist. But it was the choice you made at the time. 

Make peace with it. You got to spend time focusing on something you enjoyed, and now you are in a new stage in life with different values. Wishing you had those same values (i.e - financial security) YEARS ago isn't all that fair to your past self. You did what seemed good at the time. 

Something you could try to do is informational interviews. This is when you reach out to a professional and meet with them, not to interview for a job, but simply to learn more about their organization, and what they do. Maybe there is even someone at your current software company you could have coffee with a learn a bit more about their job, how they got there, what experiences they've had in the past, what degrees they have, etc. 

You can also reach out to other companies. I know of someone who did informational interviews with professionals from over a dozen Human Resources firms, which eventually led to her finding her top two or three HR firms she wanted to work for, so she eventually applied and got a job with one. 

More school is always an option, but take your time exploring. You might consider a master's degree, you might consider trade school or a medical technology program. Lots of options out there.

You don't need to find the perfect job or feel like it's your whole purpose in life. Chances are, nothing will feel quite like that. But hopefully you can explore your options and find something worth while for you. Good luck. ",2019-06-25 09:05:56

We know we are behind on retirement but came out of school with a combined 100k in student loan debt and have aggressively paid it down to around 40k now (she has BS and I have BS/MBA). Overall we make considerably more right now than we need and have been using that on the student loans. 

I’ve worked in construction management since getting out of school and have had ups and downs with that. I’m very good at it and enjoy building teams and systems, but in two different roles in the industry I’ve experienced the same issues with massive hour expectations and work/life balance struggles. For context, it’s not uncommon to work long weekdays then cap the week off with over 40 hours between Friday to Sunday. My wife and I have had some issues based on her frustration with me never being home and being exhausted to the point of uselessness when I am home. I can’t blame her at all. 

I’m very strongly considering switching to manufacturing and taking a 15-20k hit in salary as a result (in a maintenance management or planning role). I initially started looking for manufacturing roles that would be around the same salary, but most either want lots of industry experience or have major travel elements. This move would however bring my hours down a lot to close to 40, and most of the roles I’m pursuing have flexibility in the hours. She works 530-4 M-Th, and while I don’t expect to work 4 10s it’s looking like I could make my M-F schedule 6-3 or something similar to get home before/when she does. 

I’m leaning heavily towards taking the step, but what negatives am I not considering? I know that this move would delay the student loan payoffs and am completely prepared for that, but what else should I be thinking about? 

Most of my family I talk to tell me to stick it out until the loans are gone, but my big fear is looking back in 4 years at a zero student loan balance and either having lost my wife or realizing I’d wasted a full decade of my youth in an industry I don’t enjoy.

What's to say she won't be dissatisfied with your performance as a husband when you take the pay cut? Sure, you're around more often, but you're worth less money. She's eventually going to want a bigger house for the kids, a few nice vacations, and ongoing placation beyond that.

Are you willing to chase down another person's happiness in lieu of chasing your own dreams? 

Sounds like you could really start making huge bucks within the next 4-5 years if you stick with your current trajectory. For a vast majority of upper middle class breadwinners, the 20s are when you slog and grind hard af so that you can see copious success through your 30s and 40s without the same impact on personal life that you had in your 20s.

My question to the group is, is there ever situations where it may actually be of some benefit to the company you're leaving?

&#x200B;

I've got a potential job offer coming up. I've asked for a raise at my current company, citing numerous sources of data suggesting that it's a fair argument. The response is ""we don't have it in the budget this year, CEO wouldn't go for it, etc"". Other employees have told me that they have received the same response. But magically, when someone gets a job offer paying more, my current company matches it.

It's a situation where I enjoy my boss and the company. Just not their old school approach to compensation. Even if they matched my potential offer, I won't take it. I'm not mad at them and there's no ill will.

I'm confident that I could say this in an exit interview without burning bridges. We have a good enough relationship for that.

My thought is, is it such a bad thing that I call my current company on this? Yes, they may not change. But they sure as hell won't if no one says anything about it and just smiles and gives the ""It's just an opportunity I can't turn down"" answer. If I could potentially open the door for someone else to get a raise in result of me leaving, to me that's a win.

I have been with this new company for about 2 months. 

I've witnessed my manager have a rage fit (akin to a temper tantrum) directed at my colleague over something my manager misunderstood. 

My manager is a hyper micromanager that has embarrassed me ""in front of"" (typically through email) individuals both in and outside of our company.

He has a tendency towards rude behavior such as cutting you off mid sentence once he's decided he doesn't have time to listen. Also for example... He has told me to ""be silent"" in conference calls, then when I quietly try to assist him with a misspoken word or a note he's searching for he throws his hand up in the air to mime ""Silence!!"". 

The issue I have currently that I need help with is:
We have a project kick off meeting to attend 4 hours from our office. Long story short, he has told me that I am going no matter what. If I drive my car, I will be driving him back from the meeting, he will be taking a train to get to the meeting. 

He did not ask if I would give him a ride. He told me. He's done this once before regarding an hour-long drive to a meeting. (He asked: Are you driving to the meeting or taking a train? I told him: I'm going to drive. He said: Okay, then I'm going with you.) The meeting was first thing in the morning, I'd have to drive to pick him up then drive to the meeting.  Incidentally this didn't happen, because I was pulled to cover other work.

I am physically sick with anxiety, despite some honest efforts to accept it and process it. I'm even detailing my car this weekend, as I think that will set me slightly more at ease.

 In part I know it will be ""fine"", I don't believe he'll treat me poorly in the car. I am incredibly uncomfortable though, his behavior is inappropriate at best. I am also a young woman and uncomfortable with his apparent subconscious need to intimidate me and my female colleague.

Does anyone have any advice? Tips on how to get out of this? Anything that will set me at ease, and ease my nausea?

I know I could look at it as an opportunity to boost my relationship, but he's universally resented at my company and by our subcontractors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d7s5zk/how_can_i_manageup_a_raging_micromanager_who/,133,"Most companies do not allow people to use their personal cars for company business.

Your auto insurance might actually cancel your policy if they find out you used your car for business purposes. Do. Not. Do. It.

If the company needs you to travel for business, they get to pay for it. Why do you have to drive while the boss gets to take the train? Inform your company that if they need you there, they will buy you a ticket. If they balk, then your response needs to be “well, I guess my attendance isn’t that important, is it?“

I  like the company I work for. However, I have been here 3 years and my  last actual ""raise"" of any kind was over 2 years ago. Last year bonuses  added a couple of thousand to my yearly income. This year I expect to  make 3-4k less than last year.

From  my knowledge of the company, we are making similar money as we did last  year. My 3 year mark was 2 months ago with not a hint of a raise or cost of living adjustment. My pay is the same as it was 2 year ago so  far this year. No bonuses given so far this year.

Base  pay is 44k for a Marketing, IT & Website management role in the  company(multiple hats). Located in the south(USA). 2 weeks vacation, no  sick leave and a small healthcare credit($125) each month that won't cover any descent plan on the marketplace. No dental, life or vision. No 401k either. I was told offering healthcare was too expensive for a small business so a credit is offered instead.

The credit has not been increased in what I can only guess is more than 7 years. Each year the healthcare on the marketplace goes up by 14-25%, or so it seems. In the 3 years I have been here my tiny credit is worth even less towards a plan. Most family plans are now 850-1400 a month that cover anything. $125 is a drop in the bucket.

We have around 20 employees most of the time. I make most things work  around here along with managing several websites(and building them). I  also have the official title of Marketing Manager and do marketing tasks but its not the main role even though I have the title. I report directly to  the owner and a direct supervisor above me. I am also the companies Photographer/Video guy with our own studio.

But, that didn't mean that the candidate needed to know \*every\* technology. We sorta meant it more along the lines of ""some"" to ""most"", but definitely not none.   


Here's my attempt at providing some career guidance this week: Don't let job requisitions scare you if they list stuff that you may not have any direct experience with. That said, definitely be honest with yourself. Don't apply for a position that you know that you aren't qualified for. You're wasting your time as well as the time of our interviewers. But, do not let a long list of requirements necessarily dissuade you from applying for a position that you honestly believe you could add value to.

He said that he had written a list of things I needed to improve on. When I asked for the list, he refused and said that I needed to fix everything on my own.

2. Theres nothing like working for yourself.  I ended up putting a lot more hours into work because I was not working for anyone else.

Ghosted after accepting job offer?!,careerguidance,"I recently quit my job of 6 years that I loved because I was recruited by another company through LinkedIn who saw my skills/experience and thought I would be a perfect fit for the job as manager overseeing 3 different high volume locations on a high school campus. 

Recruiter invited me to a invite only job fair. When I arrived the HR rep automatically assumed I was there for a ""shift supervisor position"" which is way lesser of a position than I was going for/ qualified for. She said there was only shift supervisor & assistant management positions open. I told her I must have been mislead, and I had spoken to a recruiter on linked in. Only then did she ""check her computer"" & see that in fact, there was a full management position open. 

The interview itself was with the general manager, & I completely nailed the interview. This company focuses on guest service and standards so I answered my questions around that. My district manager from my previous job used to be this managers district manager as well, so I made sure to ask if she knew him in the interview. They did seem worried that I had worked only low volume locations(my companies high volume doesn't touch their low volume), but loved that I had experience as a leader in 3 stores, supporting other locations & had opened a brand new location in the area recently as well. I also had all the management training done, certifications done, & experience training leaders/tms for the district.  I almost expected to be hired on the spot. But was told they needed to get through the rest of the applicants, see how the day plays out & then would get back to me. 

The recruiter reached out to me and asked what I thought. I was completely honest, I told him about the mix up & how the hr rep seemed to judge me based on my age. He said he would figure out what happened because he had spoken prior directly with her & said that I specifically was there for the upper level management position. He basically hinted that I was overqualified. 

The manager reached out to me and asked me to come in for a second interview with another manager. The interview was with both managers. It was extremely laid back and it seemed like more of a meet & greet then an interview. When I explained all the training I had, the second manager asked the first what one of them was- and the first goes ""thats the training you're doing now."" The second manager asked the first if we talked about pay, where the first manager kinda of whispered - well I think that *hr rep* will discuss that. 

2 weeks went by and I thought ok, not happening. Then I get a call from the hr rep apologizing because they realized noone had reached out and then offering me the position. I explained I was still interested but was currently at work & asked if I could call back in a few hours. "" Ok no problem! ""
2 minutes later the 2nd manager calls me and asks if I'm still interested, I told her I just spoke to Jessica & I was, but I was at work and would call back in a few hours. I called back and neither answered their phones, kept ringing. I left a voicemail on one. Noone ever called me back but HR rep emailed me the welcome packet, job offer, etc. The position was for assistant manager (a position lower than I had interviewing for) but salary pay & higher than I was making at the job I was working. I completed all the paperwork (e-sign) sent it in, and asked if It was possible for a later start date so I could remain professional with my employer & give them correct notice. Hr rep replied it was no problem and since I let them know about my vacation during interviewing. She offered I start the day I come back. I said that would be great!

Since noone had called me back to discuss more of the position, I reached out to check about dress code. They said they would order me a shirt & asked what size. I replied back with size & a thank you. Now time has gone by and I am meant to start in 6 days. I reached out the day before my vacation to the 1st manager, Ccd the 2nd manager in, & did not get any responses.... I asked about the rest of the dress code, and where exactly/what time I would be reporting to since there are 3 locations on campus. 

3 days have passed since I sent the email. I'm on vacation at the other end of the country & would rather not make a phone call because the manager speaks very broken English and it's hard for me to find somewhere quiet here.

Finally there's IT and without obvious experience you'll need something that shows you know what you're talking about.

People rarely are paid for their potential.. being willing to learn and a go-getter doesnt sound like she is actively doing more yet.  If you were coming to me as a boss with that, I'd probably say no too.

if she doing more though...there is lots you can bring up.

I keep seeing responses about costs to replace her vs paying more.  That's a terrible reason to pay someone more.  Don't do this.  It sounds like you are 
trying to avoid a burden more than get her what is deserved. 

First and foremost, do a market survey of typical compensation for someone with her education, skills, experience and salary.  Where does she measure up? if she is truly underpaid, that will be apparent in your research and you can use this.  Market value is where salaries should start and go up from there.

What does her evaluation show as contributions to achieving the goals of the company.  try to quantify how much more than expected was saved or earned because of *her* filling that position.. and that it wouldn't likely have been that way without her.

explain why professionally *you* need her. give examples as to how she helps you focus less on tasks that otherwise would get in the way of taking care of what your boss is really relying on you for.  without her reliably taking them off your radar, your productivity is going to be affected.

Bottom line is people generally stick around mainly because of loyalty, lack of options, money, job satisfaction, opportunities to advance, or geographics.  you should contemplate why would she stay?  if she's already considering leaving.. would money be enough and for how long?

474,eq8dfj,False,None,54,Unhappy in a new job. Is it an awful move to resign after two weeks?,careerguidance," 

Hi Reddit!   


I am in my third week of my first permanent job post-college, and I've realized that this job might not be for me. During the interview process, I was told that my job would entail significant daily human interaction and interpersonal cooperation, which I personally need to be happy and productive. My first two weeks, however, have generally consisted of over seven-and-a-half plus hours of uninterrupted time in front of a computer screen and a few short minutes of small-talk with coworkers -  a schedule that has me quickly becoming depressed in my cubicle. Almost all of my limited work with others has been done via email. Before my hiring, they mentioned to me that there may be ""the occasional day of 8 hour screen time,"" but that it would be the exception.  


I'm seriously considering quitting, as I was just assigned a several-month long project that is not likely to change my work situation. I'm at a loss, because I never envisioned myself in a situation like this, and especially not after so short a time. I don't ever plan on being a job-hopper.  


My biggest concern with moving on is that I fear wasting the resources of the organization that hired me, and I also don't want the HR Manager and my boss to get in trouble for bringing me in and then me leaving so soon, since they were both responsible for hiring someone who would be able to come in and do important things immediately. They are both wonderful people who I don't want to put in a bad situation by leaving.   


That said, this schedule and job are killing me thus far, and I don't see myself staying long-term anyways.

475,dl1tf7,False,None,53,Thinking of quitting dream job because of toxic managers; can't win for losing. Any advice or insight?,careerguidance,"**TLDR: I had a successful event recently, but no good feedback from any of my toxic management. Management only talks to me when I've done something wrong and I'm reaching my last straw.  I originally wanted a raise, but now I'm thinking of leaving my dream job at this toxic workplace. What would you do?**

Hi everyone,

I'm a woman working in a toxic, male-dominated industry at an American company in Japan. Cool, famous company with big name-recognition; awful awful working environment.

To give an example of what I'm working with, the territory manager is a cold Japanese guy (let's call him Tanaka) who feeds on negative energy and my direct lead is a misogynist narcissistic American (let's call him Jimbo) who has really adapted to the Japanese culture of not being PC at all. He also has an awful temper, talks negatively about everything and everyone and will straight up ignore you if you're below him and he's mad at you or if he's wanting to feel important.

Jimbo's made jokes about cheating on his girlfriend, he's made multiple people in the office cry with his outbursts, he's belittled my ideas and then taken them to HQ without me in the discussion. When I asked him about why he did that, he gaslit me and said I remembered it wrong. He's done so much more, but I will leave it at that for now. Tanaka feeds off of Jimbo's energy and has given a lot of clout to Jimbo for his seniority and knowledge.

Until now, I've been trying to get through and biting my tongue because it's a dream job at a dream company with great benefits. I'm also trying to make it 6 more months before leaving so it doesn't look bad on my resume. However, a recent incident has my blood boiling, and I think I'm at my last straw.

I have been in charge of an event that takes six months of prep. This is the first time I've been fully in charge. We had record-breaking numbers and turnout for the event. Another team was involved in getting speakers for the event.

I was giving updates to Tanaka about the numbers, especially when we passed landmarks. I was expecting a pat on the back or something (he did that for the last person who was completely in charge) but I only got silence from him. I was a bit annoyed at this because he's quick to give negative feedback, so I was hoping for him to finally say something nice...

At the afterparty of the event, Jimbo pulls me aside and says, ""Good job on this event BUT you need to be giving more credit to people. The admin manager (gossipy JP woman) told me you've been taking all the credit"". I was shocked and hurt by this because I had never said this success was only because of myself. I was also increasingly annoyed because Jimbo frequently calls himself the ""One-man team"".

I didn't want to think the team thought I was taking all the credit so I immediately tried to rectify this by thanking everybody for their hard work. I said I couldn't do the event alone, and I also got some nice sweets for everyone. I also wrote HQ with giving the team clear credit for their work, and HQ wrote back saying we did an amazing job (nicest feedback I had gotten that far; was in tears when reading it).

In the end, I couldn't get any positive feedback without a ""but"". The territory manager has been colder to me than usual (I have also been noticeably quieter/standoffish than usual for sure and Japanese people are the most passive aggressive people on Earth).The general admin lady has barely talked to me for the past few weeks which has been awful because she was usually nice to me.

I was going to ask for a raise but the territory manager is so mean-spirited. I'm getting to the point of wanting to leave my dream job. These people have been so awful. I would like to try and work at HQ, but I have had absolutely no success in finding any advocates for me there. I feel like I should talk to Tanaka and see why he's mad at me, but direct confrontation doesn't always work in Japan, and I'm tired of apologizing to these grade A assholes.

Misc. info; we recently had reviews for everyone. I was quite honest (while being hopefully professional and leaving anecdotes out of the reviews). People haven't received their reviews yet and the hammer's coming down on me probably early next week...

I feel depressed and helpless. The most interesting thing about me is this job and I don't know what I would do after this...

Any advice?

Pretty typical Asian management, actually. You are not really going to find anything different than this in Asia. It's the main reason why Japanese women (mainly) want to leave Japan so often. I've lived in Taiwan for the last 12 years, I'm male, and this is exactly how every job I've had here is. My advice is to stick it out and just understand this is the work culture in Asia. It's not nice or good, but it is what it is. They will flat out make up negative stuff about you. I've had it happen to me for years. The negative things they make up are often very similar to the problem the administrator has, as you wrote. Just this last year one of my bosses said he was worried I am becoming negative. He made it up completely. Made up a whole story that myself and a coworker got in an argument. That coworker and I laughed so hard together about that. Anyways, the administrator is one of the most negative people you'll ever meet. Hilarious he said I was becoming negative. I take all this with humor. I still get my raises every year (recently quit, actually, but unrelated).  Just try to remember that Asian cultures don't give a lot of praise, but instead criticize and complain a lot, and people above you at work will shit talk you all day. It's not you; it's them. If it was you, they'd fire you. About people ignoring you, also very normal. Reason being is if you can get in on the ""hate train"" the more likely it won't be directed at you. Pretty awful.

I have \~13 of customer service/retail. I was a kitchen manager at my last job.

In January, I had a serious medical episode. I collapsed at work. I should have gone to the hospital, but I was too delirious to know what was happening. I got on a bus and made it home. While this was happening, the owner of the restaurant screamed at me. I was out for a week. When I came back, the manager yelled at me in the office until I had a seizure/panic attack and was hyperventilating on the floor, then left me in the office.

After that, I couldn't be in the establishment without panic attacks. I decided to quit at the end of February. They ended up asking me to stay, and I gave them six weeks longer than was my intention. My last day was April 1st.

I promised myself that I wouldn't go back to kitchen work.

Part of the reason that I had medical issue was the physical and emotional stress of the job. I also have joint and back pain. I won't dwell on it, but I just can't do it anymore.

I decided to look for literally any entry level desk work.

I set up a linkdin and indeed account and have stalked craigslist and indeed, looked at neighborhood facebook groups. I had two friends of mine who do hiring help write my resume and the generic version of my cover letter (I customize it per application). I bought professional-looking clothes for interviews.

Three of my interviews have gone very well, and they were encouraging in their rejection letters. The other three were discouraging. One of the better interviews was Monday, and I haven't been formally rejected yet, but I think it's coming. I will follow up on Monday.

Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. Some of the people who interview me seem to be incredibly impressed by my skill pool (it's varied; though I have customer service, I also have an associates in graphic design, am a published author, and have a few years of entry-level coding experience). The one I just got the rejection letter from heaped praises on me, in fact. They basically told me they needed to interview one other person as a formality. I still proceeded with other applications and interviews, but I can't lie: their rejection feels like a punch to the gut.

Some of the people who interview me clearly don't know why I'm there. Two of the interviews have been with someone who chose my resume and also the person/s who would be my manager/s. In both cases, there was clearly a mismatched set of expectations about hiring qualifications between the two. One woman looked at my resume and literally wrinkled her nose and said '*Kitchen* manager?'. I tried to maintain professional behavior, but I knew it was over.

Financially, the writing is on the wall.

I can make this June's rent, but I am neglecting to pay utilities, medical bills from my episode, student loans (deffered), and health insurance. What's more, my pet has a medical issue. I was able to respond to the first emergency, but it requires follow-up that I can't pay for. I'm also low on food.

Instead, I find myself constantly having to help people with their tasks, on a near daily basis. This is draining me. I feel like maybe this gap in the skill set is playing a major role in my lack of motivation, since if I'm being honest, I constantly feel like I'm being dragged down. My own progression at work has been really slow for a while.

I really don't know what I should do. Is it simply time to leave the job? Should I just tell my boss that the team needs some professional training? But then again, I don't want my team to think I think they suck. I don't think they do, I just honestly think that their skill level should be higher considering the amount of experience they have. I personally have about the same amount of experience as they do, so I can't find an explanation for the skill gap. Another possibility I'm dreading is that this could be a sign of depression. Could that also be a possibility or does it sound just absurd?

I'd really appreciate any help or advice. Please don't misunderstand my post. I'm not complaining about my teammates, I'm just honestly trying to figure out the source of my lack of motivation and how best to tackle it.

EDIT: Just to reiterate in case this goes the wrong, I don't think my team are bad at their job (even though I truly think some of them could be better), I just think that maybe I also might have worked on my skills a bit too much. Ok I'll say it, there's no other way to put it, I do think I'm good at my job. Not amazingly great, but still good (I did put a great deal of effort though).

What do I do?,careerguidance,"So I am currently 19 years old taking summer courses at my local community college after my 1st year at my actual university.

I am set on enlisting (not going officer) into the Air Force but do not know whether I should do it now (after summer courses are finished), or when I graduate. The tough thing about this situation is that I set myself up to graduate college in 3 years instead of 4 (2022 instead of 2023). The other tough part is regarding the money that the Air Force allocates per year ($4,500) so that would limit the amount of courses I could take along with having to work my job on base.

488,dg4dso,False,None,22,Is it bad form to reapply to a place you turned down?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

A few months ago, I was between two job offers — one with a great company and one for a (massive) promotion at my then-current job. I agonized over it for a few days but eventually chose the internal hire position due to higher pay and generally liking my coworkers. I politely conveyed my regrets to the other company and wished them luck.

Well, choosing this position was a mistake. I've tried to stick it out, but it's getting to the point where I simply can't take it anymore (not receiving enough training, no clear expectations, being spoken to very unprofessionally/made cry, etc.). I've been looking at other jobs lately, and found out that the other place is hiring for another (position I applied for).

So my question — is it bad form to reapply there? I had nothing but genuine interactions with those I interviewed with, and it purely came down to money (of course, I didn't tell them that). Am I likely to be seen as flaky, or have my application passed over for having chosen another opportunity? If I manage to get another interview, what do I even say?

494,c1rxjn,False,None,57,Quitting a job with nothing lined up due to mental health - terrible idea?,careerguidance,"Hello all,

I’m at a crossroads and need some advice. Would quitting a job without something lined up be a huge black mark on my record? I’m currently at a job in high net worth wealth management that’s making me absolutely miserable. I love my company overall, but my current team’s culture is toxic and rife with bullies. We’re also working on a soul crushing project through the end of the year which has and will continue to require a great deal of mandatory overtime on nights and weekends. 

I would normally never go against the conventional wisdom to not leave a job before you have a job, but I think pushing through much longer will break me. I’m at the point where I’m having nightly panic attacks due to how much I dread having to go to the office the next day. I’ve also starting having suicidal ideations where I imagine killing myself in the office specifically. I would never act on these thoughts (I think), but the fact that I’m having them at all is worrisome.

I know my situation isn’t healthy, but I’m terrified of quitting with nothing else lined up as I live in a highly competitive and high cost of living area (San Francisco Bay Area). I’m so overwhelmed with the hours I’m working that I can’t even begin to think of applying and interviewing to new jobs, let alone get the mental health help I need. I’m also worried that quitting won’t even give me the relief I’m so desperately craving as I’ll likely be too stressed over being unemployed to fully relax and contemplate what I want. Additionally, I fear the the problem isn’t the job, but me. A part of me thinks I’m just a deeply sad person who will be just as miserable at my next gig, so there’s a chance I would be giving up my career only to end up just as miserable. What are my chances of landing an equivalent or better job if I take time off in order to protect my wellbeing? 

A bit about me for context:

-24 years old - have worked at this company for 2 years. I loved my first team and the overall company culture, but I wouldn’t be able to transition teams until 2020.

I work 13 hours a day and I have to work 18 days straight to get 3 days off. I receive no overtime pay or per diem. The 3 days off are intended to be a chance to go home, but much of that time is spent traveling since I’m in the middle of nowhere, and I have to spend hundreds of dollars out of pocket to even leave to go home. The closest grocery store is an hour away, and I do t have days off to even go there. I have to go right after work and it’s a 3 hour ordeal. I have to spend an entire night just to get groceries.

I understand that you as a company sometimes need to pay new hires more to be able to acquire them and I also get that you won't be giving out raises for current employees left and right to keep the costs in check when the incumbents aren't pushing and seem rather content with their pay. But what I don't get is: If an employee is performing well and communicates he's seriously dissatisfied with his/her salary, why would you let him leave and hire a new guy with lesser experience even though you have to pay him an above average salary to attract him and it will take months or even years until he's completely on board and knows all the processes. What's the benefit of that from a company's perspective?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ag6mxj/whats_the_reasoning_behind_paying_new_hires/,122,"I think it ultimately comes down to statistics. They want to spend the least possible on payroll. When they figure out how big (or not) raises need to be, they look at overall data. If they give a 10% raise, most people will probably not want to leave, but payroll just went up 10%. If they give a 0% raise, then payroll doesn't go up, but they are going to have to replace people.

But what if it is in between? Statistically, if they give a 0.5% raise and assume they need to replace 50 people, then they will need to pay 50 new people their full market rate, not to mention recruiting costs and the lost productivity. If they run the numbers again at 2%, then they might have to replace 1 or 2 people at full market rate, but that ends up being a lot cheaper overall than giving *everybody* a higher raise.

That's why it pays to be the employee that leaves for better pay. They know full well that the ones that stay are being paid below what they are worth, and they will continue to pay them below what they are worth as long as they think that enough of them will just take it, complain, but show up on Monday anyway.

I left a job I was unhappy with two months ago for  what seemed like a dream job. 25k annually to 55k salary. Well, that turned into a huge mistake and I was let go after six weeks*.

I felt lost at this point, funds depleted, motivation and drive gone. After a few weeks and countless applications to dead end jobs, I drunkenly must have applied to a fairly high end corporate job in my field. 

Some days later I ended up having a phone interview and a week later an in person interview. There were 6 other candidates, some with 4 year degrees and myself with no degree but some experience with the role.

Long story short, I landed the job...

What tips, advice, or other info can you give on making it in this world? Is a business casual dress code that bad? How do I keep my peaceful, hippy soul from being crushed by country club, jones keeper-uppers?

Today all employees at my workplace were issued a letter stating our hours are going to be cut back by 20% (work 4 days as opposed to 5). We are required to sign and send back acceptance of the proposal in the next two days.

Is this legal?

The individual contract I signed at the start of my employment states I'm on a salary with a regular working week of 38 hours.

I'd like to hear your opinions on the matter. Thanks in advance for the feedback.

EDIT: through my research I can conclude it comes down to the wording of the letter your company provides. If it's a request or proposal to change your hours - totally legal. You can decline to sign and then face whatever repercussions come of that. If the company does not give you an option and adjusts your salaried hours without consent - not legal and you can take the case further if you wish.

I went to school for sport management and haven’t found a full time job in the industry since I graduated in ‘17.

My brother is 18 years old, left school last summer, and has been working in a high end fashion/furniture store as a Sales Assistant. He has been there for over half a year now and is thinking of his next step. He enjoys the fashion industry and ideally would want to continue and grow in this field, ideally into more the Design side than just Retail. Retail is a cool start, but it's low pay, hard work and weekend shifts. Not ideal.

Through a networking event at work he got in contact with a Senior Manager from Chanel, and after asking my brother to sketch a super quick design and talking for a good hour, he invited my brother to a week long trial.

The catch? The company is in Paris, France, and we live in London, UK. My brother loves French culture, listens to French music, but his French is basic at best.

The week long trial would be a working interview of sorts during Paris Fashion Week, which my brother has been going on about for years, for a full time job, again in Paris.

My brother, after thinking for some time, has decided not to go. He feels he isn’t ready and is too young. However I feel this is lack of confidence and nerves talking, this is literally his dream job and even if they don’t hire him after the week, the expense of being there for 1 week is surely worth the experience and putting it on your CV? I also think that since he’s in his first serious relationship, and works with the girl in his current workplace, that could be swaying his opinion, although he denies this.

What do you guys think? Should I butt out or push him to leap for this? I understand he's young, but this company is on another level to others and this could be a one-in-a-million chance.

I work as a financial analyst and recently things have been very very high stress. I recently was assigned a new department 3 weeks ago. My director demands immediate & accurate results, while everything I turn in never seems good enough. I’m expected to take ownership of my own work and to figure things out on my own (about the department because my director is fairly new as well and doesn’t have the bandwidth or knowledge of how things were done in the department in the past to answer all my questions). Basically, every night I dream about work and barely can rest peacefully. Even when I nap on weekends, I am scared to check my phone in case I see a message..and whenever I do, my heart skips a beat and my anxiety is activated. I don’t have an appetite at work and I think I’ve lost 2-4lbs in these past 2 weeks. I really want to be able to relax on the weekend without thinking of the impending doom that is the weekday...please, does anyone have any tips on how to separate work and personal life? I’m the type of person who gets fixated on things easily, so it’s hard to be 100% present with my friends/family because my mind wanders back to work. I don’t want to look for a new job yet because this is my first job out of college, and a lot of the positions I see in other companies require at least 1-2 years of experience in finance. And I’ve tried methods of distraction (watching TV, exercising, socializing), but my mood is ALWAYS ruined the minute I see another message from my director, and I lose motivation/joy in those activities.

511,dx1w4z,False,None,38,I got a job after being asked not to apply - how to handle pissy coworker? (XP on AITA),careerguidance,"My 3-streets-over neighbor Leah and I are in each other’s orbits bc we have to be. Both have kids the same age, on the PTA together, mutual friends, kids in the same sports league and school. Never dislike but never warm bonding either. 

Here’s the timeline of what all happened:

April: I was working for a smaller  company and it would have been great except the owner was a total psycho and kept firing people. I started applying for jobs; and emailed Leah with my resume, asked if she’d submit it for an open role at her company. I indicated it was no problem And no explanation needed if she said no. This company is kind of sought-after as an employer and has a decent referral bonus. 

Leah emailed me back. Sorry, she wasn’t comfortable working with somebody she knew. This co has 6000 employees in our city and she and I have very different job functions but whatever. 

ETA: I got fired a couple days later; the owner claimed my resume “was seen” on a job board. 

I shook Leah’s email off and applied anyway. In the last year we’d been granted custody of my late cousin’s 2 kids on top of our 3 biological ones. Not cheap. 

I heard a couple snotty comments from Leah about, “god it must be so embarrassing to be fired” and “job searching is so hard” during the time I was out of work. 

I interviewed, got the job and started in May. Turns out my former employer has himself a bad rep. Yay! It’s gone great for me. 

I didn’t reach out to Leah not wanting her to F anything up. I also kept quiet about getting a new job, where I was working, etc around everybody we mutually know. 

Today: I finally saw her in the company cafeteria. She acted all defensive and creeped out, asked me what was I doing there. I explained I’d started recently and she continued to look at me like one would look at a crazy person screaming on the subway about the apocalypse. 

She asked to see my badge, which I showed her, and then said, “great catching up, see you around!” and went back to my desk to eat. 

I got a couple IMs from her that she felt like I was devious to apply for the job knowing she wasn’t comfortable working with me. I pushed back that our jobs haven’t intersected in 6 months, and that in a company this large there must be other people she knows outside of work - there are at least 3 other parents from our kids school I’ve run into. She pushed back that I should’ve respected her wishes and that she felt I’d deceived people. I responded that I was done with the conversation. 

I did screenshot the convo and sent myself a PDF. I mentioned the incident to my boss, who just rolled her eyes and something like, “ugh, thanks for letting me know. You may have to interact with her department in Q1, so I hope it blows over.”

515,eoadse,False,None,31,"Wasted my 20s. Love to work with words, but zero contacts. Where can I professionally go as I approach 30?",careerguidance,"I messed up my 20s. 

*Very* long story short, I suffered a crippling depressive episode that lasted for a good year and a half. I got kicked out of school a few months before I turned 20 and didn’t really get back into it until I turned 22. I was so exhausted from my mental health issues (in my early-20s, I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, ADHD, and clinical anxiety, none of which went treated until I was in my later-20s due to problems with my insurance) that I just wanted to get my degree and graduate. 

And I finally did back in 2016. Since then, however, I’ve been bouncing around from dead-end job to dead-end job, unable to accumulate enough experience or good will to puff up my resume. I’ve landed a great job before (incredible benefits, easy work, friendly enough co-workers), but I struggled so much with the “work from home” aspect that I fell behind and, eventually, was let go. 

I’m turning 30 in a few months and I’m at an absolute loss. I’ve felt discouraged before, obviously, but always with a hint of hope ahead. It’s really hard to be optimistic, however, when you’re reaching the end of what everyone calls “the most important decade of your life” and have nothing to show for it. 

**I went to school for communications.** I didn’t have a specific path to take with it; I settled for the most generic BA I could get that didn’t make me want to blow my brains out. **I love to write, to work with words and grammar.** I’m often the go-to proofreader among my group of friends and was even given the side-gig of proofreader/assistant editor at a few of my jobs/internships. 

The problem is that I have no idea what to do with that. I live in SE Michigan, close enough to Detroit to commute, I guess. Despite Detroit having an expanding downtown filled with flashy companies, none of them are hiring for a job that puts emphasis on writing, editing, or proofreading (at least not on any of the job sites, from LinkedIn to Indeed and everything in between). 

There are a few small publishing houses on the west side of the state (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, etc), but there lies the other problem: I’ve never learned how to put together a writing portfolio. I’ve asked my writing professors, but (surprise surprise!) *none of them know.* I’m so glad that what little money I make is going toward student loans I had to borrow for an academic experience in which my professors literally couldn’t offer me the one piece of knowledge I would desperately require after school!

I know I’m rambling at this point, but I’ve been a “long-time lurker” for a while now and I missed a student loan payment this past month due to being unemployed and I’m just picturing my entire fucked-up future flashing before my eyes all because I wasted my 20s.

- I was told to work more independently but despite my efforts to do that, my bosses are micromanaging and complain a lot 
- Job search is going poorly, no calls back yet 
- I'm seeing a counsellor but can only do so every 3-4 weeks because bosses are very reluctant to give time off 
- I've overheard bosses talking about me and it makes me extremely paranoid 
- Intrusive anxious and negative thoughts and increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts 
- Told myself I'd resign in January if I still felt this terrible but I'm so scared

- Work is so emotionally exhausting that I have no energy to put toward fuelling my job search, and can't get time off unless it's 2 weeks in advance (e.g. for interviews) 

- I've been at this orgo for 1.5 years now (plus used to work there part time on top of the 1.5yrs) 

- I feel unable to function properly and my performance is somewhat poor because I feel so mentally unwell

- Frequent nightmares about work and physical anxiety symptoms

- Trying hard with meditation, breathing, reworking thoughts but it's not proving very successful 

- I'm miserable every day and it affects everyone around me because I'm having difficulty being present in the moment 

- I live with my parents and have very few expenses 

- Everyone I've worked for in the past has been very happy with me, there are probably other people I could use as references in worst case scenario 

- I have a few options of what I could do next, all of which are closer to my dreams/career goals

How can I avoid the same situation?",careerguidance,"On paper, the job I have now is pretty much exactly what I thought I wanted to. I’m a death investigator for a county in the US, and I get paid well, I have good benefits, and I get to use my degree on a near daily basis. 

I‘ve been at this job for about a year, and the problem is I’m not getting the experience that’s expected for a year in this field. I have past experience as an autopsy assistant, so I’ve been diverted from my actual job position to fill a personnel shortage in autopsy. Pretty much from right after my start date I was told that I’d be working in autopsy for the foreseeable future and getting training in the investigation division when time allows (time very rarely allows). 

Everybody at my office seems to think there’s nothing weird or wrong about being hired for one job, and then having to do the duties of another. I’m getting paid more than an autopsy assistant would, but the reason I was so excited about this job is that it was a way for me to stop doing autopsies! They’re super interesting, but they’re physically and emotionally exhausting and I’m just tired of it. 

I’ve been applying to other positions, but there aren’t a lot of open death investigator positions around. When I have gotten to interview, the lack (I have done some, but I have to take overtime shifts to do them) of actual investigations I’ve done is a real detriment. 

I’m just exhausted with the situation I’m in and I want to leave. I have applications out for other agencies for similar positions but now I’m worried about the same situation happening... is there really any way to ensure i get to perform the functions for the job title I’m hired for when every job description now has the ‘other duties as assigned’ line thrown in?

Got an offer. Decent salary, in the middle of the posted range, and first job for me out of uni.

Manager calls to see if I had any questions, and I just confirm I'm excited, haven't read through the offer fully but will be coming in Monday.


After verbally accepting I start second-guessing myself and reading online about how I should try to negotiate.

More than a year ago I asked for advice here and some people were so kind! I actually saved some of the advice people sent me and read it when times got tough.

Here is what happened. In 2017 I moved from my home town (ended a 10 year relationship because he didnt want to move with with) because I was hired by a big tech company in another city. It was my dream job, I worked with tech and wanted a carreer boost and an experience in a big company. Five months later my whole team was laid off. Yes. It lasted five freaking months.

There I was, lonely and jobless. I had terrible depression, suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking there was something wrong with me. Maybe I was being punished by my ambition? But anyways, I was in need of a job I went through all my contacts, scheduled meetings with everyone, reached people I never met on Linkedin. Asked for referrals. Finally I was hired by a small start up 5 months after being fired.

But I still wanted to pursue my dream and I kept trying. A friend of a friend who worked at another big tech company offered me to introduce me to someone he knew who worked there. I grabbed coffee with that person who was simply very happy to help me. He referred me, I went through a long interview process and they made an offer!!!

Anyways, just to tell you: I just started at this company and I am way more passionate about the role I am in today than the role I was fired from. I get to actually make a difference now, since I am part of a small team inside this company.

Anyways, DONT GIVE UP! And dont be ashamed to ask for help, contacts, referrals. Go after what you deserve! And I hope you all have the best of luck :)
Edit: sorry for the typos and everything. I am not american and I wrote this very quickly.

I applied for a job with the state and somehow landed it.  It was a 45% raise, amazing benefits, pension etc.

I gave my two week notice and my boss and upper management were devastated.  They had big plans for me as I was supposed to take over my bosses role but between the low pay and lack of new work being given to me I had to get out.

They offered me an insane amount of money ($90k vs $71k at the state) and they will pay for me to get my masters degree.  My friends are saying this is a no brainer and to take the money, whereas my family thinks the state makes sense given the pension and job security.  

I don't know why I am so skeptical but $90k is such an absurd amount of money for someone my age and with my experience, especially given what I do isn't complicated whatsoever and I can probably do it in 30 hours.

Years ago I was a sysadmin at a little company that got acquired by a large video game company that you've heard of. Eventually I got a new boss. We did not get along, my productivity went through the floor, and one morning a friend in operations texted me saying ""hey man, sorry about the news."" I said ""what news?"" and he told me there was a request to disable my computer access because boss was going to fire me. This followed a couple of months of deteriorating conditions on the job, and on this day I had actually gone in early to talk to him about how things were going. [Twilight Zone theme]

I had already received a meeting request that morning from boss for like 10am so I was already thinking in terms of how the next few hours should go. After he went back to hold his 9am daily meeting, I gathered up all my stuff and walked out the front door. A few hours later I got a voicemail from him saying ""You missed a meeting, so I'm going to have to let you go."" Great reasoning, of course, but I was already done with him, so him giving a weak reason came as no surprise. I was relieved for the first time in a long time. AFAIK he still doesn't know what happened.

In the long run nothing happened as a result, save professional repercussions, and that a few years later I got notice of an Unclaimed Property from them waiting for me at the state. I applied for it and when I got it, it was about the amount of a last check.
  
Another kinda bad part was that I had bought an expensive car literally the day before all this. I still have it, but it was the most TV thing to have happened through all this. womp womp. Another bad part is that I didn't stay in touch with the guy who tipped me off.

Even my current boss commented on how out of all the resumes she's seen mine was the only one that was even structured normally, again just because as a Recruiter I knew what companies were looking for....

My last position I was a manager and had 1 person work under me. I only lasted at the job because NO ONE ever checked on me. In fact, since day 1, they handed me a computer at IT and no one ever even told me my job. I got bored of the faking it and really wanted more purpose to my job. I took a job in a entirely new industry and I am really struggling with my confidence in my intelligence. I feel like Im not worth my salary although the same as my last job because I feel like Im not as experienced as they wanted. I was honest not knowing the industry and although I've worked the same role, same title, in 3 other industries, what they want from me is extremely different and they actually watch you like a hawk judging your moves.

I feel like Im put on the spot so much and my mind just goes completely blank. I am supposed to ask questions and I just can't even possess a thought to ask. So lately I have been thinking maybe I really should have stayed at a lower level job. It just couldn't pay the bills so I had to take harder jobs to make ends meet at the time. Im just not smart. I feel like my IQ is just maxed at what it understands. I read a lot, always trying to learn and improve but just feel like I am capped.

I feel like a fraud in my life. Like someone will realize Im not smart and let me go. Even in school, I barely passed classes in highschool and was a D average student. College I did really well and got mostly As and Bs but that wasn't easy. I worked 10x as long to be half as good as the rest of the class.

I asked how could he tell, he said just by the way I talk in conversation....it was confirming everything I was thinking all along.

531,ffo6lw,False,None,36,"My job is NOT what I signed up for, do I continue to voice my concern to my boss or do I take a different approach and start looking for other work?",careerguidance,"Some quick background information - I recently graduated from my second undergraduate degree in Finance. For approximately 7 months, I  have been working in a Business Analyst (BA) role for a utilities company and have previous held the same role position for a financial institute (as work experience for my degree).  I have a general idea of the career as I'm currently educating myself in the evenings so I can start my CPA designation as I see myself in an analysis/accounting role. The job market where I currently live is not the greatest so I applied for basically every entry level analyst job I could find and took the first one I could get (for financial reasons, I needed money and I needed it fast).

Here's the thing - I'm an entry level employee and I'm interested in finding a job where I can learn both  from hands on experience and mentoring, but I understand I have to keep my head down and do the mundane ""chore"" tasks that get assigned to me. Anyways, when I interviewed for the role, I made sure to ask questions about mentorship, where my duties would be focused, areas for growth and potential opportunities to learn, etc. The job was laid out to be an analysis role focused on process improvement and documenting, data gathering, interpretation and modelling. Unfortunately, outside the process modelling, I don't do much of the work mentioned above. 

To make matters worse:

1. There is a huge internal company project going on that limits the amount of money that is spent on projects outside of this initiative - basically new work is not exactly going to happen for the next 2-3 years because of this. 

2. My department is split into two teams: the BAs and the Operational Support team (OS). There is a massive growth plan for the support team because the need for the technology support is growing much faster than the team right now - which makes my role feel even more insignificant.

3. My manager has spoken to me about how my role will be shifting to accommodate the support team and I will likely be acting as a tool for them to use when they need to create/model processes or documentation. 

4. My current projects involve developing internal contests (which we are now not going to run), maintaining a website, documenting communication strategies, creating bi-weekly presentations for a stand-up meeting, other small one-off mundane tasks and supporting a technology upgrade (this one actually makes sense and fits scope).

I have voiced my concern, and my manager essentially responded with training will likely be through hands-on only, and your role will be shifting to more of a support role. I don't want to seem ungrateful because I'm lucky to have a job but I have slim to no mentorship, little support from my manager, and it is turning into a completely different job than I interviewed for. 

As you may have guessed, the culture is not the greatest either but that's beside the point. I feel like I'm stuck in a job where I'm learning near nothing, I feel underappreciated and I'm truly worried for my long-term career. I'm young and looking for opportunities to grow, learn and build a career so I'm a little scared I'm heading into the wrong direction and something needs to be done (I just don't know what).

Anyways, I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, I just feel stuck. I'm just hoping to get anyone's advice on this or personal experience with something similar. Do I continue to voice my concerns or is there something better for me to do? Maybe it's at that point where I aggressively apply to new jobs and quit the one I'm in once I find a new one?

533,dy5a25,False,None,55,"Possible ""Scarlet Letter"" on my profile?",careerguidance,"Hello,

Some quick background - took a job in 10/18 that I immediately knew was a mistake from my first day. Been pretty miserable since with the role and BIG company, and at about the 6-month mark a lot of my applications were getting serious consideration, and since I work in a semi-specialized function that is suddenly in demand it seemed just a matter of time till I got a new gig.

Fast forward to June of this year - I interview with a BIG company from June-Sept, 2-hour personality test, 2 convos with Hiring Manager, talk to VP, fly out to the office, and then don't get the job.Ok - was shocked after multiple conversations with the Hiring Manager but I guess something happened in that final interview.

Then another company comes along. Interview with them from August - October and go through 8 rounds and don't get that gig. This included a Hiring Manager who knew a lot of my contacts well and told me on the phone I came highly regarded, etc, etc. and she wanted me on the team. Call from the recruiter - ""sorry""

Another I just heard back from (which i really wanted and took 8 weeks!) did 7 rounds, interviewed with Hiring Manager twice, including 2nd interview where we were vibing and she was talking about me in the role in present tense and 3 people from the team, including the last one who ""I would be working closely with""

Now none of these have done a background check- but I did get a job in 10/18 so I should be good there (nothing has happened to me legally or otherwise). Google search is pretty standard, but I feel like I would be vetted out earlier if there was something negative I'm not seeing.

Im confused why I am getting so close every time - the HM is loving me, interviews go well, follow-up emails, and then suddenly it's like sorry after months of interviews. Not even getting to the negotiation stage. What am I missing?

**UPDATE**

After asking for feedback ...” as I strive to improve my interview skills, whether that was a piece of experience that was lacking or a misstep I made in the interview process, or perhaps a way I can better present myself in future interviews.”

FIRST figure out what career path you're trying to do.  THEN look and see if a language helps you in that field.

535,78jked,False,None,29,My manager earns $490K/yr while we are paid $30K. What's wrong with this company?,careerguidance,"San Francisco, California

HR accidentally released our manager's W2 so now everyone in the office knows he gets paid $490,000 a year.  This guy plays Pokemon Go all day and doesn't actually contribute, just blows smoke and gets our president (his boss) excited over nothing.  He has been with the company for over a decade and has somehow convinced his boss that he is indispensable, when in actuality he just takes credit of our work. 

The president of the company pays everyone $60,000 a year as base.  Initially, he promised fat bonuses but has failed to deliver for 2 years, even though the company is profitable.  There is no 401K and no salary raise, so my colleague who has been here for 7 years still only earn $60,000 base.  The company dangles a carrot in front of us, saying if we work hard we will eventually be rewarded, and unfortunately the naive new blood buys this lie, which means despite the super high turnover, new grads are still eager to knock on our door.  This just encourages the president to continue his way because he gets away with it.


The job is unfulfilling and involves being deceitful to our customers, so I feel my soul dying a little each day.  The positive aspect is there is no micromanagement, so I am left alone.  I use this time to study and read, and work only about 1 hour each day (it's a 9 to 6 full time job).  The job market here is rough, and with so many of my graduate class still out of work, I *think* I should feel fortunate to have this job, but I don't.

To give some background, I am currently 23 and I've had 5 different job roles in the last 3 years. Not all of these have been change of employer, 2 of the 5 have been promotion/relocation to another team. 

My issue is that I can't seem to find satisfaction with the roles I'm choosing. I work in the IT sector and while I have been moving jobs my salary has increased and I am happy with that aspect of my career to be earning as much as I am at my age. 

However, my current job I have been in for 6 months I am already feeling bored and not challenged enough,same as I felt with my previous role where I stayed for just over 1 year, but had promotion in the middle of that time. When I joined my current role 6 months ago the start was very promising there was lots to do, I was given the freedom to innovate and establish processes which is what I love doing. However now I have finished all the important projects, the system I am responsible for is in a good state and I am left doing the boring day to day maintenance which is the part I dont enjoy. 

As a result I have found myself being attracted by LinkedIn adverts and recruiter emails promising better salary for similar/same job I am doing. Issue is, I don't want to be a 'job hopper'. I understand that it looks bad when you have 4 different jobs in 3 years even if you have been climbing up the ladder. Because of that I feel locked down to stay at this place for at least a year or two before I can allow myself to leave. 

I have tried taking onto new projects but the business simply doesn't have the need or resources to start new projects at this point.

That month I ended up accepting my current job through someone in my network with total transparency about my plans (the company said they didn't care if I needed to leave four months in). As life had it, our landlord changed his mind about selling the building and the city decided not to shut down our train line.

I've now been at my job since October 2018, and my boss (the one who brought me on) was fired in June 2019.  Since then, I've been handling all of her duties and been a de facto member of our company's C-suite, without any raise, promotion, or official acknowledgement. Including me in these conversations resulted in me leading two company-wide primary initiatives that have turned the business around.

I've repeatedly asked for a promotion, and finally my CEO/(new) boss has told me point-blank that he won't give me the promotion unless I agree not move in 2020.

Meanwhile, my partner still hates his job and we both feel we'll want to finally move next year (we'll likely start our job hunts next month and hope to move by midyear).

I can’t go into any detail because honestly I shouldn’t even know about this - if it comes out, it will destroy our company in the press and destroy all of the goodwill we’ve cultivated with our customers - but let’s just say we have to use fake emails and fake names to complete his request.

I’m pretty high up in the company - my boss reports directly to him, and while she agrees it’s not a good idea (after i explained why), she’s still asking me to move forward with it. I told her when she gave me this project that I wouldn’t do it, think it’s a horrible idea/awful thing to do, and don’t want to put my name on it at all. Her response was to not say I think it’s a terrible idea to the CEO because he’s already defensive of this project, and that if shit hits the fan, I can always walk away. 

I can’t do this, and don’t think there’s anything I can do to change my boss or CEO’s minds NOT to move forward with this (my colleague who has been assigned to the project feels the same way that I do, if that matters).

547,avpim5,False,None,29,"Left banking job on bad terms after 6 years and have done nothing for over a year - how to approach CV, recruiters, etc?",careerguidance,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I worked in investment banking for 6 years straight out of college. This was a stressful, front office, client facing role. I was in the top performing quartile of peers each year, and my immediate bosses had a high opinion of me (not trying to toot my own horn, just hope this might mitigate some of what follows). The 1st section below describes what happened, and the 2nd section gives more personal details (not shared with my former employer). My questions are:

1. Given my situation, do I need to list anything specific on my CV (obviously other than my employment ending on so-and-so date 15 months ago)? I'm thinking of 2 things: do I need to describe how my employment ended? Do I need to explain the \~15 month gap in my employment history?
2. When (if...) I speak to recruiters / at job interviews, what should I say about how my previous job ended? I can explain what happened (kind of like I do below in the ""external perspective""), but I assume when they call my previous employer as a reference they will be told I was fired on bad terms?
3. How do I explain the long gap since my previous job to recruiters? I obviously can't give the ""personal perspective"" below. I was thinking of simply saying ""personal/family issues I had to deal with""

&#x200B;

The story (from an **external perspective**) goes like this: 

The job (and especially one person in the team) was very toxic, I was literally the only junior who managed to stay in that team for more than a year or two (those before me either quit or were fired). Around a year before we ""parted ways"" (more on this below), the stress and toxicity had really gotten to me, and despite the very high pay, I had decided to resign. I tried to resign twice but unfortunately since I was a little bitch, my boss managed to talk me into staying. Ultimately he convinced me to take a sabbatical for a few months and said if I still wanted to leave after that, I was welcome to. 

I took him up on the offer but when I subsequently met with HR in the coming days/weeks, it turned out my boss had told them I needed to take stress related sick leave. There's obviously a big difference between that and a sabbatical - HR made me see a doctor, demanded updates every week, etc. Basically after a few months of this, I went MIA (not answering phone/emails) and a few months after that, the company terminated me.

&#x200B;

The story (from a **personal perspective** \- my employer didn't know any of this): 

\~2 years before I left I started using drugs quite heavily, partly due to the very demanding job, partly due to the toxic co-worker, and partly due to my addictive personality (can't blame everything on the job alone!). No one knew (knows) about the drugs and they never affected my ability to do the job (in fact I achieved my highest rankings vs. peers in those last 2 years). As soon as my ""leave"" started, the drug use spiralled completely out of control, which contributed to depression, which made drug use worse, etc. (vicious cycle). A few months in, I stopped caring about everything, never left my house, stopped talking to family/friends/work. All I did was do drugs and play video games. Some of my family/friends literally thought I had died! This continued until \~8 months ago, when I ran out of money/savings and had to move back in with my parents. On the bright side, hitting rock bottom finally made me get clean - I've been off drugs (but still battling with depression) for around 6 months now.

551,cu0tya,False,None,60,"I hate my sales job, but I also think I just hate work so what do I do?",careerguidance,"I never truly knew for sure what I wanted to do. At first a teacher, then a lawyer, then an events planner, with little roles and jobs in between from college til now.

A little over a year ago, things just got too toxic at my previous position within a non-profit organization. I had made my way to Special Events Manager, but did not get any additional compensation and was still expected to be a fundraiser, which is essentially a sales role without commission or bonus, because I was good at it.

So I said “Fuck it” and took a sales role at a huge company in NYC. I had told myself for years that I hated sales. I don’t want to do sales. Sales is stressful and unpredictable and I hate conflict and confrontation which is a large part of sales.

So I’ve been in this sales role for just over a year now. And I’m good at it. I’ve consistently been a top performer in my team. I’ve had my ups and downs, but mostly ups. This quarter however has been difficult and it is of course a quarter in which I am up for promotion if I hit my quota, which I’m very far from as is everyone else in my department due to overextension from corporate.

And I don’t know if I feel depressed because it’s just been difficult. It’s felt like everything that could possibly go wrong has been going wrong. I’ve been trying to be more strategic. Prospect my clients before calling. Be more aggressive. Be a better professional. But everything has been crumbling.

This is when I thought about the last year and wondered how I felt before things started going south. And upon reflection... not good. Even when I was excelling in my role, I was going home and drinking a lot of days. Difficult clients. Pressure from higher ups. Refund requests. I think the stress from this position has been killing me emotionally and physically more than I’ve been letting on.

But I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any job ideas that I think I’d be good at. I can deal with a pay cut, this job was never about the money, but I also need to pay bills, especially if my fiancé ends up going to law school as she plans to.

I’m developing phone anxiety which is a death sentence for a phone salesman. I can’t stand the idea of doing this job any longer when I just want to enjoy my life outside of work without dwelling on the problems I have in the office, which I do a lot.

I am now going back to therapy to deal with these issues and see how I can manage them because right now everything points to me throwing myself in front of the train that normally brings me to Penn Station (I’d never do that to my fiancé, but FUCK do I want to end it.) When things were going WELL I was killing my feelings with weed, vodka, and sleeping pills. It’s not much better now that things are shitty.

So idk what to do. Do I quit and find a less stressful job? Do I suck it up and see if this feeling passes? Do I go off into the wilderness because I’ll never be happy as long as I’m working behind a desk? I’m fucking lost. And unhappy.

I was shocked to see how dehumanizing the whole process was.

553,b8s5x1,False,None,29,Thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn updated while you’re working at a company?,careerguidance,"TL;DR: coworkers are cracking jokes and judging me for marketing myself on LinkedIn. It’s become pretty obvious that I’m doing it because I’m looking for another job. What are your thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn up to date while you’re currently working at a job?

I’ve been at my current company for about a year now and I’m looking to relocate to a new city and find a new job there. Of course, nobody at my current company knows that I’m trying to find a new job, but I’ve been doing everything I can to make myself a better candidate in the meantime.

I’ve been updating my LinkedIn and trying to make myself more marketable by adding a professional looking headshot as my profile picture, updating my work experience with some bullet points about my work, and writing a cheesy bio about my skills and what I love about my industry. Also I’ve been getting some certifications through LinkedIn learning and adding those to my profile as well.

Some of my coworkers have seen the changes on my LinkedIn and tease me about it. They make jokes about how it’s suspicious that I’m putting so much effort into branding myself and they hint that I’m trying to leave the company. It’s really starting to get annoying. Yeah, I am branding myself because I’m looking for a new opportunity, but they have such a negative and condescending tone about keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date. They make it seem like anyone who cares about their LinkedIn image is a traitor to their current company.

I think that’s really annoying because now that I’ve taken time to update my LinkedIn, I realized this is something I would do even if I wasn’t considering leaving my current company. If you’re in any type of career, your public image is so important now that the internet plays a huge role in everyone’s lives. Any single person you meet can take 2 minutes to look at your LinkedIn and learn a lot about you, and I think that’s really underrated. 

I hate how I am being judged so negatively by my coworkers for updating my LinkedIn and marketing myself as best as I can. Yes, I admit they’re right about me doing it because I’m looking for other opportunities, but i don’t think updating your LinkedIn in general for the sake of keeping your career progression up to date is such a bad thing.

I love the idea of constantly learning new things, solving problems by using that critical thinking part of my brain, and contributing to the protection and wellbeing of the environment and vulnerable populations. 

My issue is that my current career has not provided me with any relevant skills to make this transition. I’m working as a medical laboratory technician in a clinical lab. I have my BS in Biology, which isn’t completely unrelated, but it’s way too far to have gained any relevant skills or have taken classes useful for a policy analyst job. Literally none of the skills or education that I gained while in this current job are applicable in a policy analyst career.

I’ve been volunteering with a local environmental nonprofit for the past 6 months in hopes to eventually get hired. I’m slowly gaining some of the skills there and I want to take some of the proper classes to be a better candidate.

561,dwrh4r,False,None,73,I'm told that my boss needs to edit my emails before we send it to anyone vertically or outside the company. Is this normal?,careerguidance,"I started a job about 3 months ago at a hospital. I've run into a very strange situation (or what I think is strange anyway) at work. To preface, here is the ""cast of characters"" if you will:

Physicians at the hospital

Companies we work with as clients

I have two bosses:

Administrative Director

Clinical Director (a physician)

Their boss is: Executive Director (of the department. And above him are higher ups like VPs and CEO of the entire hospital and such)

I am a project manager and my job is to work with hospital-to-industry relationships on behalf of other physicians trying to get funding for their studies. An attending physician asked me to help me with a new company relationship. As we were wrapping up our conversation, he said, ""I think we should all meet together so you, myself, the clinical director, and the executive director are all on the same page and there is no confusion. Could you set up a meeting for us?' I went ahead and sent an email asking if they would like to arrange a conference call. The clinical director (one of my bosses) said, ""Oh yeah, of course. I think that's a great idea.""

Fast forward two days later, I have my weekly check in with the administrative director (my other boss). She's not happy. She says, ""you need to be careful about who you speak to and can't just go off the rails setting up random meetings by yourself."" Apparently, the executive director forwarded an email to the administrative director saying, ""What is this and who is this guy? Can you take care of this?"" And I told her that the attending physician asked to set the meeting up - I didn't realize just asking about people's availabilities would cause such a commotion. Now my boss (admin director) wants me to draft up a report telling her where everything went wrong so she can ""sort this mess out."" She also says she wants me to send her drafts of all my emails before I send it to anyone vertical in the hospital or to another company. In frustration, I spoke to one of my coworkers about the situation (they work in a completely different capacity). They said that's very common and they were told the same thing too by their bosses.

Is this normal?

EDIT: Some people are asking if I reached out to their admin assistants. I did not but I said I'd be happy to reach out to their admin assistants if they were interested in holding the conference call. I didn't reach out directly to admin assistants first because I figured admin assistants wouldn't know the context of the meeting as to whether or not it was worth scheduling one in the first place. My train of thought was more like, see if the ED even wants to talk, get the thumbs up from him, then go to his admin assistant to schedule something because he wants to discuss this matter. I would hate to schedule something, have the ED to come to a meeting, only for him to be like, ""Well, that was a waste of time."" You know?

EDIT: This is borderline naive, but I'm gonna be honest. I thought in a professional work environment with a carefully crafted email that dealt with a minor issue like scheduling, especially when directed by a director-level attending, the worst that would happen is, ""I'm sorry, who are you?"" and people would move on with their lives. No matter how high of a seat you hold. Because, I don't know - people just being kind to one another?

As for my admin boss, I get her embarrassment, but I thought the worst she could be like, especially in a position of a mentor would be, ""I mean, shit sucks man. I get it, but don't do it again."" End of story. Not write a full blown report about the ""mess you've made.""

566,ddvd7g,False,None,110,Does my degree define the rest of my life?,careerguidance,"I'm 21, have 2 years of university left to do, about to pursue a useless degree... but I don't really know what I want to do. No matter how much I try to explain it in short, it sounds pathetic. So here's my long explanation:

-Not knowing what I wanted to do, I was just going with the flow - went to business school straight out of high school, got depressed and was only able to do one semester (though I did well in the classes).

-I then applied to a different uni the following year to pursue Education. I do enjoy working with children but to be honest, I only did this to have a sense of security (a clear-cut career path) but all I had in mind was to eventually move out and teach English in Asia (SK or JP). You don't even need a teaching degree for that. Why I want to try living in a different country is, I constantly feel suffocated in my city and feel like there is so much more out there I could be doing. Anyway, I enjoyed taking my foundational/elective courses until junior year (this year) came and was constantly stick to my stomach at the thought of being a teacher here at home. I kept trying to convince myself to stay but I really didn't like what I was learning anymore and I was already dreading the thought of having to do practicums throughout my last 4 semesters. Being a teacher here (was an early childhood major too) was obviously going to be different than teaching only ESL. Eventually, I had to withdraw from my classes as I was having major depressive symptoms again, 10x worse than when I went to business school.

-I'm now taking the semester off to rest and work on my mental health but hoping to go back for a BA in Sociology in January. The motivation behind this is that: 1) all the classes I've done will not go to waste/will get credited 2) I've taken many classes on it and have always found the field enjoyable and interesting, but initially could never choose it as my major as I was worried about my job prospects here at home (STEM, healthcare, business, or die), and 3) really just out of obligation to finish the last 2 years of what I've already started. But then again, I'm in this constant loop of not knowing what career path I want to pursue <-> being afraid to pursue a major I enjoy but not knowing where it can get me long term. I'm still planning to teach English in SK for a few years because you can do that with any degree, but that's obviously not a long term career plan.

-These days I wake up with morning anxiety and I either gradually start feeling better throughout the day, or it just stays with me the entire day, my heartbeat constantly faster than normal. I feel like my anxiety is to the point where it is excessive - sometimes I would just feel empty and have no hope for the future. It doesn't help that I keep pitying myself and even wish I could just disappear and stop being a burden to my family (probably a huge motivation as to why I want to move to a whole different country). My family isn't the type to pressure me to do what they want, they just want me to finish something in school whatever it may be. Being Asian there's also no pressure with moving out ASAP or see anything wrong with being, say, 30 and still living with parents, that's a very western way of thinking I've realized.

-I would also like to mention that while I don't know what traditional career path I want to pursue, I have side hobbies that I've been doing since my first year of college. I am a YouTube content creator and thankfully, it hasn't exactly flopped and to this day I continue to make videos almost every week. I've started making money off of this but definitely not enough to become a career (at least not yet).

Ahh I don't know where I'm going with this anymore. I guess I'm trying to seek reassurance that everything will fall into place or that I can always go back to school (pursue grad school which is usually ideal for BA holders, get a certificate on something I like if I do find what that is, etc.) when I come back from teaching abroad (if I will even be back), or seek a professional's help because maybe my issue is more than just feeling lost in life but also a mental health issue idk. As I'm only 21, I know I have all the time in the world but many people my age are already achieving more than I do - there I go again with comparing myself to others. :(

Reddit is a place where there are people from all sorts of age groups so I would very much appreciate insight from a variety of you - people with experience, people who have changed careers, graduated and are not even doing something remotely related to their major, went back to school for a certificate in something completely unrelated, only found out their ""calling"" in life at 40, etc.

Edit: I think it would be best for me to take advantage of my financial dependence now and go back to business school instead of “just getting the BA and figuring things out later”. I’m starting to realize that one of the major contributors to my everyday anxiety is the fact that if I do pursue Sociology, I’m highly uncertain it won’t set me up for a career or at least a job that will enable me to live a financially independent and comfortable life. 

I’ve said this in the replies below but my passion in content creating on Youtube and having worked with brands have sparked interest in business and marketing that I never had when I went to business school straight out of high school. Through this, I am starting to find my intended career path and I’m willing to take small steps to get a clearer sense of it. The fact that whenever I look at possible jobs/careers/college programs I always lean towards business is telling. 

Trivial, but I’ll be more confident at least to tell people I’m in school for a BBA to become xyz compared to trying to explain why I’m in school for a BA in Sociology.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ddvd7g/does_my_degree_define_the_rest_of_my_life/,109,"No.

Since I graduated five years ago my life has been very rocky and my work history is a mess, with several extended gaps. After moving to California I ended up getting a clerical job related to my degree. I worked there a year and a half but then had a mental breakdown. I moved across the country (to Texas) and spent a year unemployed. I met someone and signed a lease with them. That lease ends in three weeks and my life has fallen apart. Since leaving California I spent a year unemployed and was then forced to take a crappy job at Walmart after failing to find work in my field. I’ve been there two months, busting my ass for peanuts. 

I will no longer be living with the person who I signed the lease with and if I decide to keep the Walmart job I will have to live with a stranger on Craigslist. I feel like I have no reason to stay in Texas (no friends or family here) but if I move back home to Iowa I am worried I won’t find a job at all. I have an utterly terrible work history with tons of job hopping and one two year gap and another year long gap. I will also be leaving this Walmart job after two months, further tarnishing my work history. Walmart was my employer of last resort and now I am quitting them too.

The town I will be moving to is significantly smaller than the big city in Texas I live in now and the employment options aren’t great. But I really feel like I need to retrain and get a practical degree rather than waste my life working  in minimum wage retail hell. I won’t be able to do that if I am struggling to survive in a city where I have no contacts.

576,c9uyij,False,None,34,"The career that I've studied, worked, loved and committed myself to has changed so much over the last ten years that I don't like it anymore. What do I do now?",careerguidance,"There's a lot to say but I'll try to abridge. I went and talked to a career counselor at my wife's suggestion, but I feel like he wasn't super helpful.

I like movies. I like film. I like everything about it (editing, acting, cinematography, model making, physical effects, marketing and advertising of movies, even film accounting).

I got a job doing VFX 9 years ago. I enjoyed it. I was good at it. I had free time and projects of my own to work on. Life was good.

Fast forward 9 years and things are very different; the industry has changed a lot. The companies I used to work for have done massive rounds of layoffs and closed offices. I've had to move outs of the US to find a job. I am very near the top of my career path (I'm currently supervising about 30 artists and may be supervising as many as 100 before the end of the year) but I feel like I don't want to be doing this anymore.

1. I have basically no free time (this is especially bothering because I have a very young child who essentially never get to see). I've worked every single weekend for the last three months (I don't get paid OT either) and its going get a lot worse before it gets better. This seems to be a general trend for the industry as well. It's probably worse in the company I'm at, but its not great a lot of places.
2. I have no time to work on my own projects/art and even if I did, the company I work for doesn't allow people to work on their own projects on the side.
3. I'm not taking home a lot of money. I'm making an ok salary, but taxes here are almost 50%, the place I'm living is kind of expensive (by necessity) and after living expense I'm pretty close to breaking even. We're able to set aside maybe $100-$200 a month but we're essentially one car problem away from having a negative income. My wife can't work in this country for language reasons.
4. It's not creatively fulfilling.

So I just don't know what to do. I feel like I've invested so much of myself into this career, but now I've reached a place where it seems like there is nowhere else to go, and I don't like where I am. 

I don't want to move up in my career path because those guys have even less free time than I do. I just don't understand having a job where you never do anything but work. What's the point? Why am I earning money if I never leave the office to spend it? What's the point of having a family if you never get to see them?

I don't want to stay where I am because it's kind of a miserable existence. If I move back to the US I don't think I could find another job. Despite having skills and experience, it's a very competitive market and hard to find a job. I applied for a full year in the US (I made myself apply for a minimum of three jobs a week) and I didn't get so much as a interview.

So now what? I have these skills I developed for the last 16 years but I'm just going to move back to the US and...flip burgers or something.

I've toyed with the idea of trying to freelance, but I wouldn't know the first thing about how to find customers for this kind of work. It's usually the kind of thing people go to big companies to have done.

I don't even know what I'm asking. I feel completely lost and unhappy and trapped.

Should I go back to school and finish?,careerguidance,"I have been working in the tech industry for about 10 years and have worked my way up through a few different software engineer positions. I originally attended 2 years at a university studying computer science, but had to stop going to school and start working due to health issues my mother was having at the time. I had no choice but to live independently, and I couldn't afford to take on more student loan debt to keep going to school so the only option was to work.

10 years later, I still haven't finished a degree because I haven't had much incentive to do so. I kept getting raises, was able to buy a home, pay off all my debt, invest in my retirement, and generally live a pretty good financially secure life. However, it still bothers me that I don't have that piece of paper. No one has ever asked if I actually hold a degree, and I have worked alongside people with master's degrees who were far less capable than me. For some reason, however, it still makes me very insecure.

Going back and finishing a CS degree certainly wouldn't be so that I could increase my earning potential (or will it?). Also, no companies have ever denied me a job citing lack of a 4 year degree.

If I do go back to school, I'd probably have a solid 2 years (60 credit hours) to finish. Not all of my credits transferred to a local university, and I didn't take all of the undergrad general studies years ago because I was more interested in CS at the time.

Financially speaking, it will probably cost between $15-20K to finish. It would also take me for freaking ever because I am working full time and would only be able to take a couple night/online courses (6 credit hours max) per semester.

I majored in English and History (yeah, I know). I graduated in 2008 right as the economy tanked, panicked again, and entered grad school...as a history major. Yeah, I KNOW. I wanted to remain in academia and go into teaching at the university level, but full-time tenure-track jobs in the humanities are so hard to come by that unless you go to a top tier school, you're pretty much SOL. So now I'm in my early 30s and sitting on two utterly useless degrees, and besides stepping out into oncoming traffic, I have no idea what to do with my life and all this wasted time and money.   


I live in the economic wasteland that is West Virginia. I've applied for what feels like every job in every surrounding state that would be a relatively ""easy"" move, but on the rare occasion I ever get an interview, I never get the job. I can't afford to just pack up and move without having a job in the place first; no one's going to let me sign a lease just on the promise that \*maybe\* I can find a job once I get there.   


If I apply for jobs I know I'm overqualified for, I never hear back. No surprise there. But I also very rarely hear back from jobs I'm actually qualified for. I don't even get excited when I get an interview request anymore because I know what's going to happen. And it's not like I go into them like Eeyore or anything; I'm actually a very bubbly, friendly person in real life and I carry myself well in interviews. I'm just never good enough.   


So what do I do when I've already so thoroughly hosed myself here? Going back to school isn't an option. I'm already up to my eyeballs in debt because I took out loans in grad school to help take care of my parents. First gen college student, remember? Easy money when your family's never been above the poverty line. So what can I possibly do to make this situation better? I've been writing and editing online for almost 10 years now, but I have nothing to show for it; it's all been in content mill hell sites and ghostwritten, so I don't even have a byline anywhere. I've worked off and on as a legal assistant in a law firm this past year (yay for layoffs) and my sometimes-boss has told me I need to consider law school because apparently I have a natural knack for it, but again: I am NOT adding another $100k+ to my student loan tab. I can't pay the ones I've already got. I've thought of making a niche in legal writing and turning that into a freelance business, but I don't think I'm cut out to be my own boss.   


How do I try to salvage whatever's left of my life without going back to school and taking on even more debt? I want to help people. I know that. I really think grant writing would be right up my alley. I've volunteered as a grant writer before and really enjoyed it, but getting a job in the field without the marketing/communications/statistics background most commonly wanted seems impossible.

I have an amazing team, but a manager who's a lot more particular and brutally straightforward about it..... it's been a bit harder in that aspect. I feel like I've fucked up, almost every single day. Every day there's a new crisis, even over the weekends because everyone still actively emails over the weekend.... I couldn't take it. Broke down at the dinner table today in front of my boyfriend's family after half a day of replying nasty emails and I'm utterly mortified.

Has anyone else here faced a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or find someplace better? Today was the first time in this three months that I've genuinely considered applying somewhere else.... I don't know anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bag06e/feeling_overwhelmed_at_work_and_actually_broke/,106,"Get out!

585,arog7s,False,None,53,Well paying jobs with less human interaction ?,careerguidance,"Hi guys. 

I'm pretty bad at human interaction. I'm an introvert, awkward and distant, and I always have trouble putting on the professional client-facing face that my coworkers do. I ended up in digital marketing and 2 years in, there's not much people interaction but as my career progresses I know there will be (i.e. company expands or if I join another company). I'm also losing interest in my current digital marketing role. So I'm not really looking forward to how my career progresses. 

I'm rethinking the path I'm on. I'm 27 (med school drop out, got lost a bit) which I feel is already too old to rethink things(I guess I'm comparing to my peers) but I really want to enjoy what I do. **Money** is a huge factor and I would like to reach a good salary fast.

A part from just going with it and getting used to people, is there a route I can take to a well paying marketing job with less interactions, or does it get worse from here? :/

If there's any other less/no people, well paying career paths, please do share. I am truly lost because the people thing is an issue for me :( and I'm bad at it no matter how much I try. I am willing to study subjects on the side if it means I can find something I enjoy. 

About me: 27f, I like research, being pedantic about little things (lol), environmental conservation, science, art, how the universe works, and the theoretical side of marketing. School subject faves were biology and physics, but I never dabbled in commerce so I don't know if I would have liked it. Since leaving my bad experience in med school, I've stayed away from science.

Please help! Questions , advice, tips, anything is appreciated.

I realize there is always someone like this either at school and work, but how do I ""get used to it""? 

One job I had, the manager screamed at everyone daily, including me, for no reason other than that was just the way he was. No one was doing anything wrong or not doing their job, but he was a seriously angry person who screamed if you didn't ""look busy"" enough. There was work to do and we were all doing it, but he was never satisfied. They were good colleagues actually, but this manager was the antichrist. 

My last job had a colleague who also threw insane temper tantrums just because she hated almost everyone on earth. She hated young people (we all have ""no work ethic"" according to her 60-something year old mind), people of any color except white, and anyone not American. She would throw things around the office and bully me verbally. I went to the boss a few times because she never did anything to fix this problem, and the boss actually snapped at me for complaining over it too much. Basically I was forced to enable the colleague's behavior like everyone else, so I quit. I cannot just ""get along"" with someone to make them happy, but I also will not argue with someone and act unprofessional like them. 

I'm scared to work now lol to put it bluntly. I'm actually scared of these people because I do struggle with anxiety and having to be around people who are always angry and screaming is a living nightmare for me. I do not like confrontation yet I'm always forced to interact with people who love to fight the entire 8 hour work day.

Is this how my working life is going to be? How do I actually deal with this? Or should I just try to find work at home jobs and/or start my own thing? Offices are horrible places, and I'm not willing to deal with irate colleagues the rest of my life. Being around people like this gets my heart racing and I shake from the anxiety it causes me. I've developed horrible IBS from it all. It's obviously been very bad on my health. At my last job I would have to leave the office because I would cry and almost throw up from the acid in my stomach that would get out of control due to the anxiety of the colleague bullying me and a boss who didn't care about it.

588,dcp3e6,False,None,58,Should I let go of work ethics ?,careerguidance,"Hello all,

I have a bit of an awkward question. I have been working in software industry for the past 2 years.

I personally love being an engineer since it is a knowledge based profession. You work hard, you study, you get results. You either know the stuff, or you don't. Very simple and clean dynamics.

However I have always had these teammates who were more focused on marketing themselves and polishing their CV rather than actually learning a thing or two, and doing the job. They usually are very dominant and dramatic people as well, often not afraid to pick up a fight or lie.

Now at my current job, except me and another coworker, rest of the team is focused on exploiting company resources to interview with other companies. I mean I can handle one rotten apple every now and then, but having an entire team that is lying to manager (they make up a story together) and manipulating him in order to get those resources so they can interview with FAANG or some start up is just insane.

I mean yesterday I was ill, took a sick leave, and I asked my team if someone can switch with me regarding a task at 9 am. Only that colleague helped me and he only did that afternoon. They practically didn't even responded me for half a day. How on earth I am supposed to work like this ? This is not even limited to times I am on leave and need help. It is just everyday behavior.

These people are like a cult. They have no shame, no ethics, nothing. Most of them are not doing anything for months but claiming they are just busy and get aggressive if you ask more about their work. When given a task they are doing extremely poorly yet still blame the client for being unhappy.

It looks like this is what the market is all about. Anyone who can talk about some generic concepts or simple architecture and a BFS algorithm seems to get the job but cannot do the job itself, rinse and repeat.

I had a great round of interviews yesterday and the recruiter told me I was the only candidate who made it to this stage.

I have been training with my pregnant team member to take over a portion of her role while she is on leave. This is going to be very difficult for them, but I am so excited about this potential position, I don’t think I can turn it down without major regrets.

To make things more interesting, I also just received a promotion and a 10% raise one month ago.  And they paid for my MBA (clawback expired earlier this year).

594,ex2eam,False,None,27,"Girls, what would you do if you noticed that your boyfriend (and colleague) is treated better than you in your same workplace, with same duties?",careerguidance,"I [21F] feel like I'm being treated differently in my new workplace. I know I should probably be quiet because I receive my salary, and this is what job is supposed to give you. However, I'm really hurt. I feel bad, with no gratification. The fact that I'm always treated differently makes me feel like I'm a bad person and I don't know what to do.

Let me first tell you that the job consists in taking care of animals for a company. We DO NOT have personal relationships with our superiors because we don't work together. Our job is really lonely and nobody sees us when we work. The only way our superiors know we have done the job is because we sign a paper when we start and finish the job: nothing more. No personal relationship to justify such behaviours.

I, biology student, got hired after a regular job interview. It went amazingly: they seemed to be really happy about what I did and how I think. I felt like I had found the right place for me.
After the interview I was asked to work 6 hours every day for my first month in order to do some practice, even though I got hired to work during the weekend. After that, I just did my weekend job.

On the other hand things have been a bit different for my boyfriend [26M], psychology student, when was hired. He got the job because he was unemployed and after a few months working there I suggested him to try the interview as well even if the job isn't consistent with his studies.

The interviewers knew he was my boyfriend and I think this helped him being hired: he told me that when they found that out they said nice words about me and their attitude changed instantly towards him too. He was also prepared because since I did the interview before him I knew exactly what they were looking for and I gave him some advice too.

However, the differences in the treatment between us were clear from the beginning.

In chronological order:

First of all, during the interview they gave my boyfriend free gadgets and a book. I have never received anything from them and I'm sure it's not because I'm a bad employee or something.

In addition, nobody asked him to work 6 hours everyday for the first month to do some practice like I did, even if he needed it more than me (at least I'm a biology student and I studied zoology, he is a psychology student and knows NOTHING about animals). He started immediately with the weekend job and at the moment we have the same duties.

Furthermore, at Christmas he received a present from the company (nothing personal: if that was from a friend, I wouldn't be bothered) and I didn't. I honestly don't care about the present: it was nothing I wanted or needed, but I was hurt by the fact that I wasn't (again) treated equally.

Moreover, he got his contract renewed only after 3 months he got hired. They told me I was going to be having it renewed too as well, but besides words, no facts. I had to ask THE DAY BEFORE its validity passed and only then they renewed my contract. And also, I noticed that my contract is shorter than my boyfriend's one, for no reason. Same job. Same duties. Mine will last until 11/2020; his will last until 12/2020. I've worked there for a longer time, plus I did a month full time too and I don't know how to justificate this difference between us: I worked more and I'm more prepared. Never caused troubles, always had a positive attitude and I'm friend with every colleague now.

Finally, yesterday we received our salary and he got 1/3 MORE than he was expecting (we are paid for the amount of hours done), while nobody ever gave me an Euro more.

What do you think of this situation? What do you recommend me to do?


TLDR: same workplace and job, but even if my bf got hired after me and the job isn't consistent with his studies, he was given presents and my same duties without the daily 6-hours month of practice I was supposed to do and receives a higher salary and better contract renewal.

595,ctakj5,False,None,41,Should I leave a toxic work environment after only 3 months of working there? I was previously unemployed for 8 months prior to taking this job.,careerguidance,"About a year ago, I left a terrible job. I had stayed for a year and it was the longest year of my life. The job was 100% travel, I was frequently required to work 60+ hour weeks, management was unsupportive, and there was a severe lack of training, resources, and staff. I took 4 months off to recover from health issues related to my job, then 4 months later I landed another position.

I have been with my new company for about 3 months now, and unfortunately, it shares many of the same problems as my old company. Though the work itself is ideal for this stage in my career, the company culture is extemely toxic, and I am miserable. Here are some things other people have said about my new company (which I can agree with, from my short time there):

* ""HIGH turnover.""
* ""Terrible work culture.""
* ""Unrealistic expectations.""
* ""Stifling company culture adds to low morale."" 
* ""Lack of resources from excessive penny pinching - both manpower and equipment - to do efficient work.""
* ""Severe lack in manpower due to high turnover, which results in other employees being overloaded.""
*  ""You will not be treated like you are human, they do not value or respect their employees.""

Shortly before I accepted this position, 4 out of 5 team members all left within the same month. Then I was hired, and now the 5th team member is leaving, meaning I will be the only person left working under my manager (who is the cause of the mass exdous). Things are unlikely to change and I have to go. 

At this point I have 3 options:

1. Submit my 2 weeks notice immediately. If I do this I will have 5 months of experience on my resume (May-Sept).
2. Submit my 2 weeks notice in a month. If I do this I will have 6 months of experience on my resume (May-Oct).
3. Wait until I have something else lined up.

I understand that it is always ideal to have another job lined up before quitting, but I really want to leave ASAP. Every day at this place feels like a week, and I have constant anxiety. I don't sleep well, and a lot of my time outside of work is consumed by thinking about work, and trying to figure out how to get out of this situation. I also want to add that I have money saved up for maybe about 6 months of unemployment.

My biggest concern is how this will look on a resume. Is 5 months enough time to leverage my experience to help me land a similar position with a different company? Is there any difference between staying 5 months versus staying 6 months?

This sounds awesome!  Have you considered transitioning into this? I mean by investing more time into this. Simply without any business plan you are guaranteed to set yourself up for failure. I see a lot of poor implementation of great ideas. Did you know that there are places, in the US, that you can rent out kitchens with professional cooking tools? Are there any near where you live?

* Look to other bakeries to see what they're doing - maybe you'll learn something
   * See if they are hiring -- this is hands on experience that could expand your skills beyond the hobby
   * You will learn if you like making cakes as a job, or not
      * It is something entirely different when one is required to do something with a deadline while feeling extremely lazy, or sick, or stressed
* Look to online blogs about making cakes - you might find some tips that could help you
   * this is the best part of your craft: you will learn interesting shapes and designs that you'd never consider possible
* Make cakes ad nauseam - you will get more practice and more confidence. You will find what works best.
   * Give yourself reasons to bake a cake. Invite friends over for cake and coffee. Offer to make cakes for birthdays. And don't worry about making 10 cakes, if you can afford it. Maybe have 1 cake that you can practice that design you're seeking, and the other cake as the final product for whomever.
      * I knew someone who loved making cakes and she made cakes for everyone for every occasion.
* Identify Market
   * I am from Boston, MA in the US and the one thing that we have plenty is Irish bars, Irish 'pubs', and Irish cooking. I see often a new establishment where Irish something is on offer to add to the collection of Irish-American establishment trying to offer something unique; how unique can another Irish/American place be until it can't be passed as Irish? 
   * As a baker seeking a market, you get peckish and seek donuts or doughnuts or olykoek, if I have the name right. You drive around for 30 minutes and you find a few generic chains that offer what you seek, but you want something different. Finally, after driving an hour away from home you find a shop that offers something with more of a personalized quality - different flavor, different sizes, and different ingredients. BAM! You have yourself an opportunity to add something to the community closer to you. Now the real groundwork is to find out if people are open to a new bakery offering donuts. What works 30 minutes away might not be great in vegantown, UK. That might be the reason why it took 30 minutes to find a location.
* Learn how to effectively run a business
   * Do you want to cater to cake orders online or do you want to have a physical location?
   * What type of cakes do you want to make? Are you offering limited selection of flavors? Are you offering fancy designs found in a wedding cake?
   * What is your competition charging? I saw elsewhere on reddit that wedding cakes are charged 3x more than just the average cake; someone ordered a cheesecake for 2 people and paid about 2-3x the price because it was a wedding cake even though there wasn't much to the design. 
      * Consider this - you think you can stand out and be the baker that can charge half than the rest of your fellow bakers. You try it but find on one particular day that you're having bad luck. The cakes aren't coming out perfect, or you're distracted and the design is shit. So, you try again, and again. Before you know it, the combined effort adds up to more money in time and resources than you would had received just producing other cakes. The extra cost might be because of the planning and consideration going into producing the cake for a wedding. How many people do you know are unsure of the price of their planned wedding cake before pickup?

She worked for this company 37 yrs, never called off unless it was an emergency rare, always on time unless there was a valid problem which was less than 10, and today they gave her the boot.

The company claimed she fell asleep a month ago wrote her up but she did not sign it because she did not agree with it, and she supposedly fell asleep again on Friday, however no video/image/witness proof exists, **having this job provided the insurance she needs (blue cross bs and Medicare part a part b) , she enjoyed feeling needed, she enjoyed her coworkers,** brightened her sprits and for them to just boot her was malicious.

Apparently their insurance went up because of her age is what an insider mentioned to me, which if true seems to be a plan of action to get rid of her.

**The saddest part that broke my heart was, as she was let go they told her to leave and do not say goodbye to anyone as she left, treating her like she was a criminal of some sort, who does that!!!! If they did nothing wrong, I would at least after 37 yrs of loyalty let her say her goodbyes, how rude.**

Is there any possibility of something to do? The insider mentioned to go to the company for her and ask for the visual proof of what they claim happened, anything other, my mind is so wrapped up in comforting her I can't think.

I'm attending my first APA conference soon and I'm not sure how to present myself. 

Here's a backstory: I graduated (undergrad) in May 2019, with a BA in psychology and a minor in business administration. While most people get a job related to their field after they graduate, I had the opposite experience. A few months after graduating, I had to quit the job I had during my time in college to go through 3 hip procedures, a few steroid injections, the list is nauseating. Anyways, I've experienced progressive pain for the last 2 years, and have been diagnosed with Piriformis Syndrome and Sciatica. After graduating, it seems like my body decided to just freak out and forget how to function.

In a perfect world, I would go to a doctoral program for clinical neuropsychology or have a position at a facility for clinical research. But as things currently stand, I have a degree that I'm sitting on, no school affiliation, no past internship, little to no experience in my field, no job, and possible limitations on my future due to my pain. 

This conference will be full of accomplished doctors, with years of experience, achievements, publications, all the works. During any networking, getting to know people includes asking about what they do or what they're working on. What exactly am I supposed to say about myself? *""Yeah hi, I'm an insomniatic blob of pain and don't really know if I can function well enough to complete grad school but I love research so do you have any job openings?""*

605,e5kjvp,False,None,50,How much notice do I need to give my current employer if I've been here for 6 years and my work is is very specialized?,careerguidance,"Hi!

Basically, I've been working for my current company for about 6 years now. It's the only professional job I've ever had and I've steadily moved up from financial analyst to VP. My boss is the CFO and he's very absent. I probably have talked to him four times this year. I heard that my company was closing it's doors through the grapevine, and I confronted my boss about it and he confirmed it was true. He told me I had 6-18 months (\*scratches head\*). He told me that he supports me wanting to leave but needed appropriate notice. He didn't specify what this was. My workload is either crazy stressful or non-existent. Has mostly been non-existent for the past couple year. To keep me around, I have a high salary and position title because they need me for this model I built that nobody else knows how to operate, but that's about it.

Anyways, I've been following this new company for 6 months and a job opened up that I thought I'd be a good fit for. Same pay, better benefits, same location...new coworkers lol. Nervous about it but I think that I'm finally ready to leave and start learning again. I passed the first interview and the excel test and have the final interview this Thursday. So my question is this: how much notice do I need to give my boss? My only motivation for this is that I want my annual bonus which I would receive in February. I think it's plausible I would receive this because my company laid off a bunch of people in August and gave them three months notice and also the bonus they would have received in 2020. I think that is generous of them. I know that I'll have to train somebody on how to use my model, though it also occurred to me that they might keep me on as a contractor? Has anybody ever seen this before? Also for this new job, do you think I need to be completely transparent that I haven't spoken to my current employer about leaving? I am worried my current position will need me to stay a month and that will be too long for the new job. Am I just being too anxious about this switch?

And then ask for a severance package similar to the people they laid off. Truthfully, my boss is a really nice guy and I think he might be willing to give me my bonus in exchange for ensuring all of my reporting etc is taken care of. My fingers are crossed for this one.

It is legal in Canada for an employer to waive notice, and I suspect legal in the US. Once you give your notice, your employer can say bye bye to you too and it's not considered firing. So maybe choose your timing wisely. 

It would be courteous of you to give 4-weeks (depending on anything that supersedes this in a contract) given your level in the company, but if they are folding anyways, I doubt they would want to retain you for that long.

606,d9v02b,False,None,42,"Almost 30, never had a ""real"" job, and feel just as lost on a career path as I did 10 years ago. Where can I go from here?",careerguidance,"So yeah, I graduated college 5 years ago with a music degree and studied classical guitar. I'm still passionate about music and ideally I'd want to make it my career, but I've found it hard to concentrate on a particular thing ( I play guitar, I play bass, write songs) and have largely lacked the the motivation to dedicate myself to it.

Since graduating, I've been working part time as a writing and remedial math tutor between two community colleges. I also maintain a handful of guitar students to teach and gig fairly regularly. Honestly I like what I do, especially the music stuff, but I probably only clear about 20k a year and that is simply not enough, especially when I consider my age, what my peers are earning, and the lack of advancement of my part time job. 

Essentially, while I know I'm still gonna pursue music in some capacity, I want the piece of mind of pursuing something I can actually make a career out of. And maybe that is music, but I don't know how to get there. 

I do have some ideas. First, I know I've pretty much ruled out pursuing higher ed or public schools. While I enjoy teaching one on one, I don't think a classroom setting is for me and the cost of furthering my education for that hardly seems worth it. I am however very analytically minded, and feel like I'd make a good technician of some sort, whether that's in repairing guitars and other instruments, or working with audio/visual, or with electronics. 

It's also worth mentioning that I have a basic accounting certificate and could be an entry level bookkeeper, but I've done a bit of that work and don't particularly enjoy it, and the hourly pay was much lower by the hour than my tutoring job. I am very good with numbers and precise though.

To those suggesting you go for nursing(even though that sounds nothing like what you say your strengths are and idk where this idea came from) 

To be a nurse, you have to have 5 years between your charge and the time you get licensed. OP has NO convictions. But nursing programs are very competitive. Paralegal programs can be completed by literally anyone. There is no admission process, unlike nursing, which would include a rigorous course of study before even being allowed into the program, followed by an admittance process. Only 3 states bar someone with a felony from practising law. OP just wants to be a paralegal, not even a lawyer.  Criminal lawyers would arguably be a lot more comfortable employing someone with a criminal history because their clients are criminals or accused criminals and they know that a lot of times shit happens.

OP, my only concern would be that paralegal jobs are going away pretty quickly. Especially since the recession. In fact, many of the jobs are being filled by attorneys who couldn't get work as attorneys. ",2019-08-25 01:13:08

622,b7le7y,False,None,37,"A specific question: Has anyone had a failed figure skating, arts or sports career?",careerguidance,"I wanted to be a professional figure skater when I grew up. When I was 7 my coach discovered that I was talented. I landed doubles and almost triples by the time I was 8. However, due to a combination of not understanding how life works, my parents discouraging me, and growing a backside after puberty (for lack of a better word)...I ended up not practicing enough. By the time I was 12, I wasn’t improving fast enough and quit. 

To this day I don’t love anything else as much as I love skating. I wonder what would’ve happened if I’d practiced more. If my parents hadn’t said so many discouraging words. My dad especially had a temper. He would lash out at me and make me feel worthless. My parents would tell me I’d never be anything, this was just a phase and would yell at me so much before my lessons that I’d get upset. Then when I got home they’d give me so much work to do and tell me how selfish I was. 

I remember all the other parents who would cheer their kids on at competitions. Who would encourage their kids to practice. Some parents were even willing to homeschool their kids so they could pursue their dreams. I watched kids who weren’t as talented as me surpass me because they had worked harder, largely because their parents supported them. 

Maybe if I had those parents, I would’ve made it to nationals. Maybe I would’ve ended up skating for a traveling show. Two of my coach’s students made nationals. One of them wasn’t as talented as me to begin with but had really nice parents and worked really hard. This makes me think I really did have a chance. 

I’ve tried skating for fun and thought about getting a coaching license. But I’d be bitter about my wasted potential.

I graduated college a few months ago and I am starting my first job as a mental health specialist next week. It’s an amazing opportunity I’m very thankful for. I still resent my parents for having discouraged the one thing I loved more than anything else. I still think about what could’ve been and the fact that I might not find anything I like better. I hear a song, or it’s cold out, and I want to go ice skating so badly and there’s no other way for me to let it all out but I can’t. I have this gut feeling that I won’t find anything better.

Been contemplating suicide several times and should've probably sought after therapy of some sorts, just to give you an idea of my mental state for the last couple of years.

&#x200B;

Basically couldn't land a job after my bachelors degree due to lack of experience and poor social skills. Went to several interviews, but they always choose someone else. My lack of confidence is always leaking through my answers and me trying to straight up give a false impression will always fail so I've been mostly giving straight answers, even though it will sink me in the end. Keeping up a facade would be impossible for me as I'm an introvert and have a hard time with a severely damaged self image.

But with time passing by and being stuck with a, to be honest, shitjob even tho I had a degree the field was ""screaming for"", my mental state straight up sank to levels I didn't know was possible.

Created a throwaway account due to sheer embarrassment. I am 26F, living in Toronto. I have 4.5 years of work experience. 4 years with a big financial services company where I was a business analyst and a project manager. I loved working there, however after 4 years I decided to move elsewhere so I could grow. Actually, I was pretty desperate to switch towards the end as my old company started going through a lot of changes. I still loved my job but wanted to move to a place with a better culture.  I got a higher paying job with a promotion with this investment management company. On paper it sounded very cool and I thought I would be doing the exact same things that I loved doing at my old job. However, once I joined, I found out it was far from truth. They had just drafted the role in such a way that I would say yes (the new company reached out to me and was very keen on me joining). I hated being there. I hated doing my job because it wasn't what I signed up for. On top of it, my manager made my life hell. She had no trust in her employees and kept a close eye on my monitor. If I stopped working for a min, she would start questioning me. This was also the time when I was going through A LOT at home. My brother who abused me during childhood moved in with me with my parents. My parents knew what he did to me but still insisted I put it behind me and become the bigger person to improve his life. With the stress from home and work, I got majorly depressed and went into a very dark place. Finally I decided to quit my job after being there for 5 months because I wanted time off for myself.

&#x200B;

It's been a month since then and I managed to kick my brother out. I have been actively applying for roles but I just dont hear back. When I was employed, I was actively applying too and I would hear back from 3/10 places I would apply to. I have a strong background and have worked for Fortune 500 companies only. But now, there are NO replies. I am still depressed and working on myself but it feels like I committed a career suicide by quitting only after 5 months. It makes me look unreliable or that I was fired only after 5 months. I know a month is a short time but 0 replies after having a strong resume is really pulling me down. The only responses I get are rejections. I am trying to look into going back to school also but everything just feels like dead end to me. I don't want to go back to that job I just quit because it was hell working there. Any advice or input would be appreciated. If anyone is willing to review my resume, I would appreciate it a lot as well!

637,bpblae,False,None,50,Quit job and want to change career. What steps should I take?,careerguidance,"Hi all

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. I'm 25, and after much deliberation, I quit my job a few days ago. As a brief background, I studied economics at university for 4 years, then upon graduation spent 2 years in investment banking. I quit that job in March to pursue an opportunity at a renewable energy company in an attempt to align my job more with my values, albeit the role was still working within mergers and acquisitions and exhibited the same stressors as my investment banking job. I quit this job a few days ago without much of a plan, although I am in a fortunate enough position to be able to sustain myself for the next year or so.

Reasons I quit: - Work/life balance. Upon graduating, I was full of energy and was not daunted by the long hours that characterise the finance industry. This energy, however, soon disappated. With little personal time, I miss greatly the things I used to do for enjoyment, such as reading, drawing, rock climbing and spending time with friends and family. I also am not motivated by money or status, so I found it difficult to justify continuing my career path. - Changing personality type. Before picking my university degree subject, I took several Myers-Briggs tests and was coming out as a strong INTJ, which to my knowledge would make me suited to finance/analytical type jobs. I took the test several times again recently and I'm now coming out as a strong INFP! Of course, I try not to define myself by four letters, but I think the change in my personality type can go some way to explaining my low mood. Numbers no longer interest me like they used to. I am good at analysing and manipulating data, but I don't see it as the means to an end. Rather, I see analysis as a supplementary tool to further my understanding of how I perceive the world. Spending endless hours in front of a computer screen has really worn me down. I miss having frequent interactions with people and nature and have a preference for honesty/integrity rather than doing all I can to get a deal/project approved. - Mental health. My mental health has taken a huge dent over the past few years and I was approaching breaking point. I began to freeze at work and could not function properly. I believe I have high levels of anxiety and a low mood currently, primarily driven by the career I have pursued up until now. I don't perform well in a high pressure environment.

My high level plan for the future: 1. Take a few weeks out to relax, catch up with friends and begin to try and enjoy life again by doing things I enjoy. I also plan to start seeing a counsellor to discuss the difficulties I am experiencing in relation to my anxiety and low mood 2. Find a low stress, guaranteed 9-5 job that I can coast on until I figure out where I'd like to take my career next. 3. Once I know what I want to do next, take time to go back to school (if necessary) and pursue my ideal career.

What I ask from you: I am quite certain that I want to turn my back on finance, however I am struggling to generate alternative career ideas. I have not developed my skill set outside of finance, so nothing really stands out. I have a preference for a career in which people are the main focus and where there is an element of being outdoors. I'm not overly bothered about utilising my economics degree in some way, as I fear that most jobs that an economics degree lead to do not match my values or personality. Furthermore, I view my degree as a sunk cost so I am not concerned about ""putting it to waste"". I kindly ask you how I should go about determining what career I'd like to pursue, and equally if you have any career suggestions that you think I may like based on this post I would love to hear. I am to retrain for a year / on the job, but taking another 3/4 is probably a stretch too far.

640,f3nfcv,False,None,50,How damaging is it for me to leave a new job to accept a more desirable job offer?,careerguidance,"tl;dr - I'm considering accepting a high-paying job but only working it for a month or two before accepting a lower paying job that would make me happier. Wondering what reasons exist not to do that that I may not have considered yet.  

I'm in the military with a gross annual income of about $92,000. I've decided to leave once my contract is up in early April instead of reenlist. I'm stationed in Maryland but I really want to move back home to Colorado, I've just been holding out for a decent enough job there. I figured it wouldn't be hard to land a job here in Maryland (basically doing the same job I have in the military but as a civilian) so my plan was to do that first just to keep paying the bills while I look for a Colorado job.

I interviewed for a Maryland job on Wednesday and a Colorado job on Thursday. Both sent recommendations to HR to hire me, and both hiring managers said this almost certainly means an impending job offer. Maryland job pays $118,000 and aligns perfectly with my experience, while the Colorado job pays around $66,000 and is a sort of partial career shift since it aligns with only part of my experience. Now you probably think I'm crazy for preferring the Colorado job but living there is my dream and I'm not happy here in Maryland.

Anyway, I *could* just accept the Colorado job and decline the Maryland job. But I'd be lying if I said I don't want to collect at least one month of that fat salary from the Maryland job (about $9,800 gross) before moving to Colorado to start the other job. And the Colorado job could probably be flexible with the start date by a month or two. But of course, that means I'd be having the Maryland company commit whatever resources to getting me spun up on that job only to quit soon after.

Both companies do a lot of government contracting work. The Maryland company even has jobs out in Colorado too, similar to the Colorado job I'd be taking. If I leave Maryland company so soon, do you think it will burn the bridge for any job opportunities with them in Colorado? Is there a way to mitigate that aside from NOT leaving so early? Do you reckon it could damage me professionally beyond my relationship with the Maryland company, like other companies finding out how I left that company?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f3nfcv/how_damaging_is_it_for_me_to_leave_a_new_job_to/,95,QQ: would staying at a job for 2 months look bad at a resume? ,2020-02-14 05:17:06

32M, BSA, 7 years experience in current role, 5 at current org

I’ve been in my position w current org for five years now. Over that time I’d guess my overall skills pertaining to this position improved 50%, and the job has undoubtedly gotten more complex.

I’ve only gotten positive yearly reviews and feedback. Last year I asked my manager (and his manager) what it would take to get to the next level, and was not given an answer, just lip service. Lack of path forward is a complaint I’ve heard from all of my coworkers, and as such we face increasing turnover.

To add salt to the wound, yesterday I compared my first paycheck in early 2015 with this company to the most recent paycheck and the difference is lesser than increase in inflation for that time period. That is, I effectively make LESS now than I did when I was hired. We’ve also lost some benefits and now pay more for healthcare, compounding this issue.

What next? Do I threaten to leave without a substantial raise, or do I just get out? Only issue is current job is walking distance from home, comparable position elsewhere would include :30 commute.

What can I do?,careerguidance,"I'll summarize my educational background as succinctly as I can. I got a bachelor's in neuroscience, and a master's in biotechnology. This was with the goal of getting into medical school, which did not happen. After a year of trying to get a job after the master's program, I got into a doctoral program for biochemistry. Due to a variety of factors, including the program director bungling up my qualifying exams, I quit the program after 3 years.

Since then, I haven't been able to find a decent job. My master's program director said I should command a job at least $20/hour, which has been proven to be a bald-faced lie or moronic oversight. I hadn't had a full-time job until this year, and only one paying that rate for two months. After leaving the doctoral program, I worked for 1 year at a grocery store, and 6 months at an overnight veterinary diagnostic lab. I've been at my current job for 2 months now, as a research assistant at a university. Despite promises, it offers no clear way up or any substantial pay increase whatsoever.

Now, here's where I'm having difficulty. I want to switch to a different career, but I have a few obstacles.

The first is money. I still have to pay off student loans, and I have no desire to go into even more debt for a pricey program that doesn't even guarantee a job afterwards. I already did that with my master's, and I have spent now more than 2 years job hunting for scraps. I'm not forestalling my life further playing this rigamorale in order to pay off loan shark, bloated debts.

The second is job hunting itself. The whole process is a joke, compounded by so-called professionals who give contradicting advice on how to write resumes, apply to these job boards, and whatever else. My university's career counselor is a quack with no idea what he's doing. Recruiting agencies like Aerotek either find me nothing or ignore me entirely. Networking events have netted me nothing. I have no idea where to go to get a career plan in place. Moreover, am I being ignored because I'm seen as inexperienced? A job hopper? I shouldn't be, considering I've had at least 3 years experience doing research, and my other jobs, while short, had to be taken or else I couldn't eat.

**Long story short**, I want out of my career field of research to find a decent paying job with some growth but I cannot afford more schooling (I'm still paying of my master's, thank you very much).  I have no idea how to navigate the fog of confusion and contradiction that is job hunting either. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.

I will be 23 in December and I'm from eastern Europe.  
I was always a very good student and last year I got my bachelors degree with honours in Economics (from a respected EU public uni). During the last few months of my studies I started an internship for a very well known financial company, it was supposed to be something to get some experience and pay the rent but I ended up getting a permanent offer with a decent salary and I took it. My mother did not approve as she said I should have gone for a masters degree, but I convinced her to let me work one year to save some money and decide later on.  
Well that moment has come, I've been kepping the foot in two shoes so far and I have all the options open but I need to take a final decision within a month.  
I'm doing great on my job, and despite being obviously very junior I'm getting a little bit of responsibility, I'm being sent on business trips by myself, my boss likes me etc. I like the position but probably I won't want to stay in it forever.  
My mom's point is that without a masters degree I might encounter some closed doors in the future which I totally agree on, but then maybe experience trumps the qualification?  
I would not study and work at the same time, I have a demanding job in terms of time and commitment so it would not work. The masters degree is a 1.5 / 2 years commitment (depending on the thesis).  
I make decent money especially compared with friends my age who are either studying full time or working as waitresses and secretaries. My mom is ready to support my basic expenses for the duration of the master that is rent and basic living, but it would be a downgrade from having a salary since I would feel bad spending too much if I don't earn the paycheck. Family is not very wealthy but we do more than ok money wise.  
  
I really don't know if I should give up this job where I'm (I think) kept in high consideration and the company is one of the world's top institutions. On the other hand, what if few years from now I want to develop into a position requiring an higher degree? Or I want to go live abroad and they don't consider me for that?

I find myself jealous of labor jobs like the custodians or the landscapers because it's like you have a more tangible impact and can see results of your work. I don't even know if 9-5 even exists anymore because every corp job I've held was always 8-5 and when you commute on top of that, your entire day is gone and energy as well. 

My friends/family just say go back to school or change careers but do people really thing its that simple? When I used to work as a recruiter it was almost just thing stamp that that was ALL I was and even when I networked it was all people wanted me to step into a company as. I hated recruiting and fell into the maybe I could get into HR from being a recruiter once I got in with a company, this has NEVER been the case. 

Now I am at this point were I just can't get myself to go in anymore but whats the alternative? I can't really think of a job that I would enjoy more that would pay decent. Money isnt everything but end of the day, I am alone and can't just not pay my mortgage and I do not have family that could help. 

I hate that I live for the weekends and then the weekends come and its chores and then decompressing from work then going back to work and feels like I am wasting my life.

I'm an introvert and every job I look at is so involved with other people and I just want to keep to myself and just complete tasks. I don't particularly have any ""skills"" and just have a bachelors of science in psychology. I have no clue what other alternatives are out there that are feasible. 

I am I know probably everyone else out there wishes that they could just not work or work part-time but I feel like at every job I have, after 1-2pm I just zone out. It's almost pointless to pay me because I have no attention left for the bullshit. I have no problem working hard and used to work 13 hour days back when I supervised a retail store, time flew and I never noticed. Now I just stare at a clock all day watching paint dry because its more interesting than whatever stupid pointless corp assignment I am working on. I wish I had ideas to even start my own business or something but with no ideas, skills or anything I just feel a bit defeated. 

I guess long story summed up, I hate my corp job but wondering what alternative freeing or work from home or on your own schedule jobs that pay decent. Seems like a stupid fantasy but honestly curious does anyone have a job that actually like and enjoy going to?

So I have a biology degree with a focus in ecology and conservation. I’ve had numerous internships and some research experience. I found in the past four years of university that I despise academia, so going back for grad school won’t be happening any time soon if I want to keep my head on straight. 

Personally, I feel the urge to go to community college and get a trade certificate...maybe I’m ungrateful for my degree, but I simply can’t see how I am marketable in the work force with the degree I have. I have learned that I’m a very hands on person, which is why I’m leaning towards learning a skilled trade.

On the other hand, I’ve also had an interest in GIS, so I could easily get a certificate in GIS which would pair nicely with my current degree. However, I have become quite opposed to desk work in the past year. 

All in all, I feel quite silly for the degree I got and further confused because I’m a much different person than I was when I started school in terms of work ethic...maybe I’m not different, but I certainly have learned more about who I am and what I think I desire out of life.

649,b21r54,False,None,19,What's so bad about being a lawyer?,careerguidance,"A letter to unsure future lawyers


Given to me from my law/legal professor in undergrad. I told him I was on the fence to becoming an attorney, and he sent me this.

Mr. A,

I always tell my students that I am but one side of the coin of the profession of law. There are lot of downsides to this profession. To get there in the first place you have to generally expend a decent amount of money (college, LSAT prep and the actual test, applications etc.). Then you have to take out generally $150k-$250k to actually go to school. Your loans will be at a rate of 6-12% depending on how lucky you are, but in general the interest on those loans is going to be insurmountable unless you get a very high paying job and really sacrifice your quality of life for several years.

Once you've gotten there, the study is unlike anything you've done before - 14-18 hour days are not uncommon. Once you begin to practice, you are exposed to routine long days, verbal and mental abuse from your superiors and clients and all so you can make low 6 figures with the possibility to potentially make it out of the rat race and become a partner. Except, there are generally not enough jobs, despite the glut of attorneys and if you don't go to a top school, those opportunities may not be entirely available. If you do make partner, now you have the responsibility of not only running your cases, but also ensuring that your associates are making money for you and not tanking your case. You work weekends, holidays, birthdays, anniversaries - whatever the case and your superiors or your clients demand. There is high pressure on you to deliver the best possible result to your client, even if that result isn't necessarily possible given the circumstances of the case. Your client's problems become your own problems. You take your work home with you and expose your loved ones to the stress of the job.

If this doesn't sound like something you're prepared to do, then I would suggest not going. But, as I have said, there are upsides and I am generally on the very cynical end of the spectrum for attorneys. I tell you guys not to go because most of you shouldn't go. You don't know who you are, what you want in life, and how you are going to align your strategy to achieve those goals. Asking a 21 year-old to go off and make a decision about the next 40-50 years of their life is honestly a very fraught proposition. I tell students to expose themselves to the law - take law classes, talk to University alumni who are lawyers, go work in a law firm, go sit in on law school classes. Do everything you can to prepare yourself for what it will be like and if you like what you are being exposed to, then by all means, go and enroll. Generally, students don't know why they want to be lawyers - they just assume that it's the next step in their education without asking whether they want to do this job for several decades.

In my 2 years of teaching at university, only 1 student has proven to me that they are prepared for this in every way you should be before going. This is out of several hundreds of students that I have had now. So in that way, I suggest you look at some of these things and take them under advisement. If you enjoy your free time, low pressure etc., this is not a job for you, and that is not a bad thing to say or admit. It takes a very specific type of person to do this work and that doesn't mean that that type of person is a good person etc. It just means they are attuned to the type of life this will be. Every single person I have told not to go who went anyway came back to tell me that they regretted it. That's not to say that you don't come to enjoy certain parts of the job. But if you want to last in this business, you have to love it.

I tell students to take a few gap years and go work and learn about themselves. Go see the world. Go work in our government. Go teach English in another country. Go do the things you always wanted to do because once you become a professional - any kind - those opportunities begin to disappear. I have taken a total of 3 vacations in my 6 years as an attorney and I worked during all 3 of them. Go live your life - the law and law school will still be here if you've done all of these things and still want to go. Let me know if you have any other questions.

651,ee7nrv,False,None,28,Verbally accepted a salary offer that I feel is too low. Now I am unsure if taking the job is the right decision. Am I screwed?,careerguidance,"Hi all. I am an early career engineer (HVAC automation industry). Over the last several months, I have been interviewing for a new position with a different team in my company. This position is desirable because it will carry more responsibilities than my current role, and I feel it has better upward trajectory for my career. I would also be working on projects I care about (energy sustainability). At the risk of sounding dramatic, it’s one of the best professional opportunities I’ve come across. This week I received a phonecall from the hiring manager informing me I had been selected for the position, which is obviously exciting.

I am conflicted because I feel the offer they made for salary is too low for this role. It is a 6% increase from my current salary, when I was hopeful for at least 15%. Admittedly I screwed up negotiations by not broaching the topic during the interviewing process. I was afraid of losing out on an opportunity I wanted by bringing up the topic inappropriately, which I now know was a naive and incorrect (I’m still young and make mistakes) way to look at it. For context, the salary I’ve been offered for the role is similar in value to offers I had at graduation.

The reason that I feel the offer is too low is because of the increased responsibility I cited earlier. My role is currently purely design. This new role would carry sales engineering and project management responsibilities, in addition to design responsibilities. The role will also have me traveling 50-60% of the time to customer sites for field work.

In addition to all of that, changing to this team will require me to move 18 hours away. I will be giving up my girlfriend, my friends, family, professional relationships, and volunteering roles in my current area. I realize these are all personal items, but I feel it is important to note what I would be sacrificing to take this role. 

I’ve been told by the hiring manager and others in my life that “the money will come later,” but to me that feels  hollow. I’ve always been told that the best way to receive larger raises is by changing positions. And at the end of the day, life is not just about the job you work. Right now, part of me feels like I will be making a mistake to give everything up I mentioned just for a job if it’s not the salary I want, even if it is a very desirable role. 

What are everyone’s thoughts? Am I screwed since I verbally accepted (I haven’t signed any contracts)? Is it too late to negotiate? Is the increase actually reasonable, and I am just being entitled? Am I too “in my head,” and just getting cold feet about what is still the right decision?

I recently graduated and got my first serious job. It's a bit repetitive and doesn't have much to do with my studies, but I can use French there, I like it, and it's good money. Then, I got a mail from the place I used to intern at with a job opportunity. I got it and been working there for 7 weeks. So now, I work 4 hours every day at my first job and 3 days a week for 8 hours at my other job. I was so happy at this opportunity as it's what I'd like to do. However, it's been pretty bad. There is so much work for me to do at this second job and so little time, I keep making mistakes. Besides, it's the first time I work the office job with so many tasks at hand. I feel like I learned the complete basics during my first month (for example, to write down everything I need to do – otherwise, I'll forget it), but it was already one month too late. As you can imagine, I make a lot of mistakes. A lot of them. The colleague I'm supposed to help told me recently I can't make any more mistakes, I've reached the limit. Because of all those problems, people at the office don't really like me (and I've never had people skills). I started to have bad anxiety concerning this job. It's Saturday, yet I'm afraid to go to this job on Monday. I feel like I'm too stupid for it and I have impostor syndrome. But on the other hand, I like what I'm doing there and it's really important for my career. There's no other similar place to work in my city.

655,b6v80o,False,None,47,Is my boss bullying me?,careerguidance,"Update: I handed in my notice today! I feel so liberated! He was super nice to me all of a sudden too


I’ve posted about this before. I was hired as a social media executive (some events involved too) for a small business, reporting into the marketing director. When hired, she told me she would be going on maternity leave, but assured me it wouldn’t be long at all, she would be on call, and the Big boss would be around to pick up certain aspects of her job (which I have no experience in).

Cut to now, she has gone completely awol and we have found out she won’t be etirning until September, so that’s 7 months off! Bear in mind I’m paid a junior salary ($30,000)

I have been piled with a huge amount of work I have no experience in which is very technical, so have admittedly been struggling. As a result, my boss has been shouting at me for my lack of experience and the fact that he has to help with my job.

The other day on the phone, every time I said ‘ok’ to something, he would scream ‘stop saying ok!!!’ at me. 

When he gives me tasks, he also screams at me to ‘stop writing things down!!!’, as apparently I have to soak things in.

Yesterday, we had a meeting and he said he was going to create a presentation as I have a lot to do (and I have no experience of using the spreadsheet that has all the figures- I was actually told to not touch it). He comes into the office 10 mins before the meeting asking what I have prepared, and shouts at me in front of everyone for not preparing something.

He also screamed at me in front of everyone regarding a retainer contract my marketing director signed, but then proceeded to apologise as it was signed before I started.

This on top of him micromanaging everything I do and calling everything myself and my colleagues do shit, is giving me serious anxiety.

The weirdest thing is that he flips from being awful to very nice, so will take us to a really nice lunch after he shouts.

I’m going to hand in my notice mid-May as I seriously cannot take it anymore. I have plenty of savings so don’t really care if I have nothing lined up. I feel guilty about leaving when she’s on maternity leave, but now realise that is not my problem. 

I am also grieving at the moment (lostva family member to cancer) so it’s a struggle.

I’m quite a sensitive person however so don’t know if I’m overreacting? Would be good to hear your thoughts.

TLDR: manager went on maternity leave, I have been piled with work and my boss is screaming at me daily, leaving me with anxiety. But am I being too sensitive?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b6v80o/is_my_boss_bullying_me/,90,"Thanks for the comments guys!

So unprofessional!

657,erhsup,False,None,27,Working 2 full time jobs. How to avoid burnout?,careerguidance,"Long story short, Job#1 barely supplements a livable wage. I also have about 10k worth of debt. I’m learning how to manage money better but I’m at the point where I want to get the hell out of my family home. I figured it would be way better to alleviate the debt first, while also learning to handle my money better, before setting off on the path of independence.

I decided to pick up a second job, and it turns out it’s full time. I was unaware of the schedule because I was getting two different responses from the HR and the manager. So I’ve pretty much doubled my income which is just fine. I’ll be making about 3500 a month, and figured after the monthly bills, I can have the debt paid off in 3-4 months, and another 3-4 months worth of saving for a nest egg once the current lease is up. (I’m on the lease with a parent). My hours are pretty much sun up to sun down (17 hours), roughly 5 hours of sleep in between days. I have no days off, aside from 2 mornings and 2 evenings off (spread across 4 days). I’d like to keep both jobs for at least 6 months, losing the second job is not the end of the world, but it will delay my financial goals considerably. I’m afraid that this mindset will lead me to quit the second job once this motivation inevitably dissipates during times of weakness. So my questions are as follows:


What are your tips to avoid burnout?


Are there any tips to make standing on my feet for 15 hours at a time more bearable?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/erhsup/working_2_full_time_jobs_how_to_avoid_burnout/,88,"Don't put yourself through this. It's not worth it. You will burn out. People who burn out have a harder time finding good jobs, getting promoted, and managing their money. So it is a bad economic decision. 

If you're willing to work crazy hours, there are jobs out there that will pay you just as much with just a single job.

I suggest you go back to the HR and manager and tell them you can't work full time and ask them to do it part time like you originally discussed. If they won't, then quit one of the jobs and keep the job that pays the most.

Then, with all this extra time you have, hunt for a better paying job. Tell potential employers you're willing to work 60 hours a week if the pay is enough to compensate for that extra time.

I would not pay down the debt immediately. Build up a 10k nest egg first. It's important to have an emergency fund in case you get laid off or your car breaks down. Just make sure you don't increase the debt. Once you have a nest egg, then you can get out of your family's house and pay off the debt ASAP. ",2020-01-20 19:03:20

I am unable to keep a job that pays me enough to make a decent living. I had a pretty good paying job at a corporate healthcare technology company as a proposal and marketing communications specialist but I was only able to keep it for 2 months. I took it very seriously. However, as hard as I tried, I was unable to maintain my focus throughout the entire day, no matter how many milligrams of Ritilin I was prescribed. I also had issues with punctuality which ultimately lead this company to fire me last Friday. While I was late to the office just a couple of times, it was more an issue of making sure I was getting to all the meetings on time, and there were probably 10 to 12 meetings each week. The last straw for this company was when I missed an entire meeting because another meeting ran overtime into the next. This is still my fault because I needed to have better time management and communicate to the head of the first meeting that I needed to leave at a certain time in order to make the next one… I am unable to adhere to a rigid corporate schedule or maintain my focus during extra long meetings. 

Anyways, I am very disappointed and I feel like a total fuckup. I think I need a new career path, because I have had these same issues in the past.

Hello /r/careerguidance I'm quite possibly experiencing one of the most soul crushing, self worth ruining things of my life, and I could use some advice. I had my first real job as an engineer, and was fired, not for performance, or misconduct, but for reasons which essentially amount to ""poor culture fit"" after a bit under a year. I've been miserable since, but have been applying to jobs religiously, the only problem is, the responses I'm getting are from jobs which represent a 25% pay cut, and are not the same position in the career. I'm unsure of how to proceed. I need a job, and the area in which I'm applying is closer to home which has a significantly lower cost of living than where I relocated for the position I lost, but I don't know if I should accept the first offer that comes in, or if I should wait for one which matches my goals.

Not only that, but I'm extremely embarrassed about being fired, and am having trouble explaining it out loud in phone interviews, essentially its boiling down to ""I left because my energy and ambition did not adequately match that of my group"" (Read: I'm annoying and everyone hates me) or ""I was asked to leave for"" the above reason, if its not asked whether or not I was asked to leave, I don't bring it up, and I'm not sure if that is the right decision.

662,aipm9q,False,None,20,How can I talking to my boss about excessive travel?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

I am a software developer for a large consulting firm. I was told during the hiring process that it would require up to 50% travel which I am okay with. However, I am currently on a project that requires me to fly 700 miles to the client site 4 days a week every week. I leave my house for the airport every Sunday at noon and return home every Thursday around 10pm. 

I love my job but the traveling but being away from home for the majority of every week is mentally and emotionally draining. This position is perfect for me in every way except for the heavy travel requirements. My current project will be wrapping up soon and I am trying to decide how to approach the topic of traveling less in the future with my manager. 

My boss is a fantastic person and he really cares about his employees. I feel like I could talk to him about this, but I don’t want it to reflect poorly on me or come across as laziness or insubordination. 

How would you suggest approaching this situation?


Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/aipm9q/how_can_i_talking_to_my_boss_about_excessive/,93,"You should just talk to them about it, period, especially if your current project is wrapping up. I have worked with consultants in IT for a long time (and my spouse works for the big 4)—travel burnout is not at all uncommon. It’s all about how you frame the discussion.  

Rolling off your current project is a really good time to address this with your department head, or resource/staffing person.   Some projects require more travel, some require less.  As you’re wrapping up the current project, just tell them all the good things you have said here, and be positive—as in, “I love what I’m doing, but for my next role, if there is any consideration for less onsite work or a project that is closer to [home], I would like to be considered for it, given the increased onsite presence requirement that my last project demanded.”   We have people asking for lower-travel projects all the time, for tons of different reasons—their health, issues at home, general burnout, etc.  This kind of stress on your body does take a toll, and you have to take care of yourself.  Last year I had a young (<30 years old) consultant  pass away from a heart attack.... before he did, he was texting his boss from the ER because it was go-live.  Not trying to be a downer, just saying to keep perspective.   

It absolutely never hurts to ask, and it’s much easier to be in a position to try and accommodate  this request when you’re going to be placed on your next project, versus you throwing your hands in the air at cutover refusing to travel anymore—which I have also seen, and does not go over well.  You should proceed delicately since I read above that it’s your first project, but if you frame it in a positive way, no one can really fault you for simply asking.   Don’t demand, don’t complain, don’t make comparisons to coworkers or friends’ companies, just ASK for consideration, and frame more as a “less travel now, will do more for next project” kind of way.  In larger firms, it’s also more likely that they could do something about it, since they presumably have a lot more options as to where you could be placed. 

If they are a good employer and value you as it seems they do, they will do their best to accommodate you.  We make every effort to put someone on a lower-travel project after they have been killin it on a FT travel role for the better part of the year.  You have to do what you can to take care of your employees in these kinds of roles, because if you don’t, they will leave.  

Which brings me to my point—if they absolutely can’t decrease your travel or aren’t willing to consider it...or if their pipeline is only mega-travel intensive projects, then start looking for another job. The job market in your industry is insanity right now, if we sleep on getting someone through the interview process by even one day, we are losing people.

Now, 8 months later I am the most depressed I’ve ever been, anxiety has completely stripped me of my appetite to the point where I’ve lost 10 pounds in the last two months. Every morning I wake up sick to my stomach because I dread my job. I hate what I do, I don’t care about either industry my job falls in, I am given zero resources from my superiors, with unreasonable expectations. I don’t have a background in this industry. I am so utterly lost. Working home alone stuck to myself all day doesn’t help either.  

For the past two and a half months, the only thought in my brain has been “just quit.” As far as I see it, having no job can’t possibly be worse than this horrible anxiety and depression I feel every day. I don’t have the energy to pursue other work full force, I don’t have the energy to pursue anything creative that would make me happy.  I suppose it would be a bit different if I had officemates to commiserate with, or if I had a partner coming home every night, but the fact is I don’t. I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m afraid that “this is it” for the rest of my life without seeing a way out. And if “this is it” I can be honest and say this is not a life I can survive in much longer.  

I guess what I’m asking is, how irresponsible and stupid would it be to just quit without something solid lined up already? I’ve 7 months of living expenses saved (although I would HATE to deplete my entire savings), and I have a few freelance gigs I’m already working on (nothing that comes remotely close to my current salary, but I wouldn’t go immediately to zero income). 

Quitting would allow me to have the bandwidth to a) search for another secure job I’d be happier with, and b) expand my hustle for freelance work. I guess also c) pursue personal creative things I don’t have time/energy for now.  

I’ve been setting up meeting after meeting after meeting with different companies in my industry, but no one is hiring right now. I’ve learned I have a fabulous reputation, but there just aren’t any openings. But I can’t just wait around.

I'd be asking for a raise that puts you at your salary + the salaries of the people they'd have to hire to do all the extra stuff you're doing. But even then, what you're doing doing is not sustainable. Ask for a ridiculous raise or for new people to be hired to take those extra hats you're not being paid for. ",2019-05-29 20:56:47

I don't want to burn bridges, but at the same time, this offer is too good for me to decline?",careerguidance,"To give some background context, I work as a project coordinator. I've had some issues at my current company, but I'm acknowledged as one of its top-performing employees. I have glowing performance reviews, and my interactions with management from my direct supervisor all the way to the COO have all been positive. No one has a bad word to say about me. I've made suggestions for significantly revamping some of the processes in our project management office, and by surprise, some have actually been implemented.

However, I've been unhappy for awhile-- while acknowledged as a high-performing employee, I'm paid the same as coworkers who have not received the same accolades. My job description has expanded tremendously, and I've received the same raises -- in both timing and amount -- as colleagues who do less than I do. I was told I won't be promoted to project manager (the next logical step), but project plans, etc. that I've developed are used as templates by more senior members of our PMO. I'm even responsible for training newly-hired project managers on our processes. As a result, I feel extremely disrespected by most of the office's management team. The workplace is also toxic. New employees rarely last more than three months.

On a whim, I answered a LinkedIn message from a recruiter, and to make a long story short, I now have an offer letter in hand from another company. It's a significant pay increase (more than I'd make at my current job if I was left their pay increase schedule). My job title doesn't change, but I'd also be working in an industry with better long-term growth potential and higher salaries overall. While I like the offer and prospect of going to work for this new company, I also have a really good relationship with my current boss. I'd feel bad for leaving him in a bind, but it doesn't make sense for me to stay if my current company doesn't attempt to show that they value me. I also know that if I give them a chance to match, I'm most likely first on the chopping block. Why be loyal to me if I'm not loyal to them?

Love your work, but realize that it’s just a job and for all their startup y’all, they are a company that does not actually care about you.

Now the flip side of that is you have to learn the culture and mission in order to manipulate the bosses so you can move up the latter and get your work/ needs prioritized.

Just my two cents. I’ve been at a start up for 3 years. I’ve done the massive overtime thing, but failed at manipulating management and cultural jargon like some others. I’m done, burnt out to hell.

Edit: wanted to add this: the startup environment can be great. Like another person mentioned, it can be like working with a close group of friends. But that changes as the organization grows.

681,e0gxa4,False,None,33,I was devastated after a staff meeting - how to I move on?,careerguidance,"I started this job as an admin. I work with three people. One was hired right after me. Over the last three months, I've been told I've been doing a great job, but still have a ways to go (obviously after only being there three months). We had a staff admin meeting to discuss who was doing what and who was going to do what.

Before, the higher-lever work went to the two more senior admins (80%) with my providing assistance to them (20%) and the other person is still training. Now, the higher-level work were to be divided among my three coworkers and I am odd man out. Instead, my role is literally doing the grunt work. Instead of doing account management, I'm now responsible for grunt work like cleaning out the fridge on Friday and keeping the copier room tidy. I never felt so insulted and hurt. I have and can do more challenging work and am not sure why or how this was decided. It was a conversation I was left out of. I believe our bosses asked the senior admins for their input because they told me to be prepared to doing some grunt AND accounting work. One of the senior admin said that the new alignment would leave her overwhelmed and asked if some of it could be taken off her plate. She was quickly shut down instead of giving some of it to me. I didn't speak up because they would have shut me down too. No need to look stupid in addition to feeling upset.

I have so much more to offer and have proven it. I know I have not made as big mistakes as the senior admins did after their first three months. The head boss mentioned that if someone is screwing up all the time then you're not going to be giving this higher-level work and I couldn't tell if he was directing that comment to me. No one has said anything to me about any major and consistent mistakes on my end. Not one person. Even in the meeting they mentioned some of our shortfalls and mine were minor like missing a call as compared to my coworkers' mistakes literally costing the firm money. I was going to ask them if something happened to make them feel like that I can only do grunt work last night and I didn't because I was too upset.

I keep on telling myself that it's not like I'm going to be paid less to make coffee and won't need to stay late doing paperwork anymore. My sense is that people will start to ask why is I am being paid what I am being paid to make coffee and/or I'm too stupid/unwilling/lazy to do anything else. I will ask my boss and her boss on Monday.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am not young. I am actually older than my co-workers.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Yes, there is some type of disconnect and I believe that it's because one or both of the senior admins are speaking on my behalf to our supervisors. One in particular. I started to cut that person off because I know I cannot trust her, but I was told that cutting people off at work would backfire by the other admin. The other two admins have made serious and costly mistakes when they first started and even recently (which was the reason why we had the meeting to begin with). Those mistakes were brought to their attention formally (closed door meetings with supervisors) as well as plans to prevent them from repeating those mistakes. I, on the other hand, have never had one of those ""closed door"" meetings. There were times when they mentioned to me casually ""hey, next time you take a message from XYZ make sure you ask them for both their cell and home phone"" or ""next time review the bill to see if anything on it looks off."" So when they're talking about people screwing up and being left out of challenging work, I cannot figure out if it's directed at me or to all of us. This troubles me because it can be inferred that they might taking the approach that I'm not worth fixing.

&#x200B;

Finally, I've had blunt conversations with my boss and her boss. I explained to them my anxiety and they assured me that I was doing fine, I am being way too hard on myself and (repeatedly, might I add) that if someone is going to be fired, then they would know it. They stressed to me they try to fix the problem(s) and I see that with current and past employees. They've mentioned that A LOT.

&#x200B;

TBH, I believe that people are right when they say I am not promoting myself enough. I also believe that I might have gotten blamed for things that I wasn't to blame for and am not aware of it and one of my co-workers needs to be cut off. Come Monday morning, I am going to be the first person in the office and speak to my boss and squarely ask her where do I stand and ask her how the choice/justification/logic was made to switch things up and even ask for some of the high-level work back. That is all I can do and keep my mouth shut.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have no intention to quit. I've had a few other jobs and this is still the best job that I've ever had. I am literally making $8 more dollars an hour, pay $0 for my benefits, close to home and the people are generally nice. It's stable, beautiful offices and I am grateful to be there.

&#x200B;

I got fired today for excessive tardiness. I won't go into details but suffice it to say that I was in my position for several years, and after today I've realized that I was very much in a ""don't give a shit"" kind of place, mentally. I fully acknowledge I was fired for valid reasons and have no beef with my former employer, this was entirely on me (INB4 ""maybe you should just show up to work on time"" - yup, I know, and this will definitely be my primary focus as far as personal development goes).

&#x200B;

I held a corporate-level, senior SME/admin role, and I possess an extremely high level of knowledge and experience in a fairly niche field. I'm currently looking at some positions that could offer as much as a 50% pay increase from what I was making, in a similar or almost identical role, so obviously I was being underpaid - which I kind of knew already, and is probably the biggest factor in that ""don't give a shit"" attitude I had. I totally acknowledge that just getting lazy and not caring, rather than seeking a new opportunity, is totally my fault. But, now that I'm having this come-to-Jesus moment, I'm not sure how to proceed with future opportunities. Do I tell them I was fired for tardiness? Is it acceptable to decline discussing the reasons I left the company? How would this affect my chances for landing a new position, or salary/benefit negotiations? I appreciate any and all advice, insight, anecdotes, etc. If you have questions I'll try to respond as best I can. Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c3hcfz/how_do_you_approach_applying_for_new_positions/,89,"You don't need to tell them that you were fired for excessive tardiness, because this wasn't the REAL reason you were fired. Look at it this way:

In your words, you were in a ""don't give a shit"" attitude, so you *wanted* to leave. Your tardiness was just a surface manifestation of something deeper—*not being valued by the company.* So instead of up and quitting, you essentially got them to fire you by showing up late. I'm sure you're not the type of person who is incapable of showing up on time. After all, you were in a senior level position.

So, the true reason you and the company parted ways was a difference in what you valued. Sure, on paper they fired you, but the true reason was that you and the company had different values.

Now when it comes to discussing this with potential employers, it's important to present it in an amicable way. Something like you ""outgrew the position"" or are just looking to be challenged further. Personally, if someone had ""drama"" at their last position I'm very suspect as they're bound to repeat history. If you need to use a reference from your last job, it's important you communicate why you left as well, so they understand.

That being said, it's important that you analyze what happened in your last position so it doesn't happen again. I would ask yourself ""How was I complicit in creating the conditions at my last job that I said I didn't want?"" I'm sure the company had some fault as they weren't paying you enough, but it's important to see what part *you* played in not getting payed enough, or not being valued. ",2019-06-21 22:18:20
683,byex4v,False,None,48,Should I advance my career or live the chill life?,careerguidance,"I am crisis trying to decide what I should do. Currently I (37m) work a very high paying tech job that allows me to work remotely. I work from home in NYC. I own a house and live with my wife and 2 small kids. There is an in-law unit in the house where my sister and brother in law live. I make my own hours, I have full control over the work I need to do, and I do it well. I grew up in the east coast, I have a good amount of friends and family here, generally speaking life is pretty chill.
That said, I have hit the ceiling on my career. There is no room to advance and at this point it's not all that exciting. Working from home these past 7 years has felt pretty isolating. I miss the workplace community and interactions.
Now I have a job offer at a company in Seattle. It's a Sr position doing what I do now. It would be in the office every day with big expectations to solve some big problems. The total compensation is around the same as my current employer, but the catch is most of it is in salary, where as my current employer it is split between stock and salary. It's a great opportunity to work from an office again and take my career to the next level.
But I am really torn about this decision. Moving and starting anew in a city I don't have a lot of connection to. My wife has a bunch of family in Portland, so that's nice, but I will be moving away from my family. Working from the office means I will have less flexibility in my schedule.
I just don't know what to do. It seems like a great career move, but am I foolish for giving up a pretty easy life for this opportunity. Am I foolish for even thinking about moving away from my friends and family. Nothing is permanent, and we could always leave in a year or two if we aren't loving it.

I have tried to think a lot why my teammates are behaving in that manner with me.

Earlier the whole team used to go for lunch together and I was included too. For tea/snacks some groups went together. I would join 2 girls at work. Since past few months, they lied to me that they are not going for tea but they did. They used to spend 30 minutes for tea and lie to me about that. I was fine with it. I tried to ask them for tea myself but they did not include me anymore despite my attempts. 
This has not escalated to lunch. They have stopped calling me for lunch from this Monday. So I have to sit alone the whole day at work. From what I see, one girl did not like me and it seems everyone is supporting and believing what she is telling. I honest have no idea what I have done. I tried to recollect my behaviour and actions and can't seem to think any wrong doing.

Can someone please suggest what I can do? I dread going to work now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/axwty0/i_cry_in_the_office_bathroom_everydqy_what_can_i/,87,"Hey man, first things first, I'm sorry you're going through this kind of anguish. Your coworkers are basically exiling you out of the group. And something triggered this change in group behavior. You need to figure out what it was.

Nobody would like being forced into social isolation. However if it gets to the point where it's making you cry everyday and you dread work, that's a red flag against yourself. Did a similar situation ever happen to you during your childhood, like in school or something? And was your reaction the same as now ? You might be a person that is high in agreeableness, maybe you're a very sensitive person.

And that's not a nice thing to be in the average workplace. Like at all. 

The workplace can be very socially intense, there's always an underlying atmosphere of friction and competitiveness. You really don't want to give off the impression that you're too nice and agreeable, too harmless, too emotional, not having the courage to confront people. Or else people will just step over you. I suspect that's what's going on here.

Maybe that girl you mentioned is a polar opposite of you personality-wise. And as a consequence she maybe hates you and has no respect for you and somehow communicated that sentiment to the group and the other co-workers resonated with it. Why would they lie to you over tea or lunch ? Maybe they think you're too soft, maybe they're talking behind your back about how lame you are and how you're probably crying in the bathroom every day. This is just my suspicion, but you tell whether that can be true or not.

Bottom line is that you need to stand up for yourself, and not accept that people lie to your face about not going to tea while you know they are doing so behind your back (make sure you're 100% sure though!). Not accept that they just ignore you by saying they're too busy, which is a total BS excuse btw, don't accept that. If you do, it's over, you're invisible, you don't matter, you're annoying, why bother inviting you? You gotta have some presence, don't be non-confrontational, show that you're not a pushover.

Whatever you do, don't just run runaway to another working environment. Your coworkers will get the last laugh and if you get to a new workplace then it might be the same thing all over again. Or worse.

Whatever you do, wipe away your tears. You allowed yourself to let other people's behavior towards you hurt you. Address the vulnerability and reclaim your emotional stability. Being socially ostracized hurts but maybe you are a part of the problem. Of course the behavior of your coworkers is straight up ""middle-school clique"" childish but hey some people are just immature / just as insecure as you and they will follow the group like sheeps.

Hope some of this helps, I used to be very shy, sensitive, agreeable, but now I'm not a pushover anymore and I don't accept shit from anyone. I encourage you to hold yourself to a fair standard ",2019-03-06 09:08:56

688,9gb66x,False,None,17,Job for quiet person who wants to work their way up the ranks?,careerguidance,"I'm currently the assistant editor of a small but influential publication in my field of study. It's a small team (3 of us) so there's really no room for upward mobility at this organization; plus, I'm feeling ready to move on, anyway. Most of the job postings I'm interested in are communications/writing/project management/managing editor-type roles. 

The problem is, I'm a rather quiet, introverted person (but not shy). I tend to need a good bit of time and space to think things through and strategize. I enjoy talking to people one-on-one. I can do presentations and structured discussions well. But drop me in a group dinner where everyone is casually conversing and I get stuck in my head thinking about everything that everyone is saying and before long just want to go back to my hotel room and knit. However, I'm apparently pretty good at projecting confidence. On a recent work trip, my supervisor (who I don't work closely with at all) told me, ""You don't really strike me as the type of person who gets stressed out about things."" Which I found surprising and hilarious because that's pretty far from the truth.

Most of the jobs I'm interested in that have room to grow and reach higher, managerial roles require a lot of people skills. And I'm just kind of...awkward.

So my question is two-fold: are people-oriented, higher-powered jobs harder for quiet people, and if so, *what are some good alternative career paths* in the publishing industry or in communications for people like me who like people, and can play the part well, but who generally prefer to work with plenty of time to think and process independently? Also, are management roles harder to get if you're quiet?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9gb66x/job_for_quiet_person_who_wants_to_work_their_way/,88,"Are people-oriented, higher-powered jobs harder for quiet people? They can be, but it depends on the person. One friend is a super introvert, and uses up her people-energy in her very people-oriented job. She loves it, but it means she doesn’t come to drinks with us very often. Another friend was initially hesitant to take a more people-oriented job, but found that people take his input more seriously BECAUSE he doesn’t talk constantly. 

I’m not sure what your role as an assistant editor entails, but there are some communications roles that really don’t require a lot of people-interaction. Larger companies, weirdly, are going to be better, because each job can be more specific, instead of a five-person team where everyone is overlapping job duties a bit. 

As for whether management roles are harder to get if you’re quiet, it depends on the company. It can take longer to be noticed and offered up for a management role. However, sometimes the quiet ones have paid more attention and do better than the loud ones. For example, one of my best supervisors was a woman who was originally hired into the same role I had. I had been with the company a couple years, and actually helped train her. She was quiet and watchful and asked excellent questions. When our supervisor left, I was unsurprised they offered her the job, but she was TERRIFIED that I would resent her promotion. I told her honestly that I was terrified that they would try to promote me, because working with her had shown me that I didn’t sit back quietly and WATCH and digest nearly as much as I should have been! So, take that anecdote as you will.

I was diagnosed with autism at 42, and with ADHD at 43. Since entering treatment, my health has improved dramatically, and I'm now in a position to work towards things that I thought could only be dreams.

This poses a bit of a problem, since I have no idea what I want to do - or rather, I desperately wanted to study a language and then translate, but my home situation makes that difficult. I know that I want to go to university, but I have to decide what to study once I'm there, and what sort of work I not only want to do, but *will be able* to do. I'm educated to UK A-level standard, and am doing preparatory college courses to get me to the point I'm confident in my ability to tackle a degree.

I'm focused, driven and meticulous. I'm a problem-solver. I love data and detail. I love complex structures. I love puzzling out difficult things. I love going deep into one small field for years. I argue a lot, and I write well. I read very fast, and I'm a good researcher. I read Acts of Parliament and draw graphs for fun. I like numbers and logic. I do basic coding in around ten languages, and I use this constantly to fix problems around me. I do Japanese fan translations. ***I'm a learner*** - I love to study. Even at my worst, I've always worked to be better.

But I also have serious issues around my health. I can't do hard physical labour. I can't work routine long hours. I can work with people, but I'd need longer periods of working by myself. I put myself across well in writing, but in speech I come across as confused and inarticulate; I don't deal well with people. I have issues with memory and attention that make me prone to constant errors. I don't want to spend too much time in front of a computer, because it detaches me from the world that I need to be *in*, if I'm ever to accomplish anything in any job. I'd like to be able to work from home some of the time, but not all of the time.

I know I want to get a degree, just because it rankles that I've been to uni twice and don't have one. But I'm afraid that I'll take the risks, lose a lot, and still be unemployable at the end of it. I'll be in my 50s by the time I'm looking for work, an age when most people are terrified of losing their jobs because they'll never be rehired.

I've had various programming jobs that paid from about $50k to about $130k.

Money is not very important for me. It's usually already sufficiently high.

I find the team culture to be more important:

* Is the manager/lead easy going, sharing fun stories?
* Do you have to be on a call with angry clients?

Here are the details:

Been at my current job 7 years. I'm 29. Started at the lowest rung now I'm in inside sales. Not only do I do all inside sales jobs functions as everyone else, but I also have about 8 other duties.

I do not see a pay raise nor a promotion in the near future. Shit, I haven't seen a pay raise in the 3 or 4 years I've been in this position. I tAlked to management about this and had a document typed up with everything I've done and taken on. How much money I've saved and how much wasted time has been saved... This triggered them to give not only me, but my full group a cost of living raise. This is all I've seen in the last 3 or 4 years. I was pissed because I specifically went to them about why I am worth more... We're all paid equally but they have one job where I have about eight. Not only that but I HAVE RUN 3 DEPARTMENTS AT ONCE INBETWEEN HIRES. They just keep piling more and more ""projects"" on me, that adds to my full time duties. 

Now that's the bad...here is the good:

I'm salary. I have 3 weeks vacation. Never work overtime. I live 10 minutes from the office. As long I work my 8 a day I can come and go whenever. Get here at 7, no lunch and leave at 3? Cool. Get here at 8, take a lunch and leave at 5? Cool. You get it. If I need to just leave, no problem. Cool people too. 

Here's the big one they hold over your head...it's employee owned. In the 7 years I've been here I own more than $90k in stocks....without putting a penny into it. I also have my 401k which they do not contribute to.

Anyway, sorry for the bit of a rant. 

Am I just feeling entitled? What would you do in this situation? I've pretty much given up on fighting for a raise. I've plead my case with clear numbers and research...its just not gonna happen. 

As much as I want to search for another job, I'm worried the grass will not be greener.

Can anyone help?",careerguidance,"I’m 21, living in England, I have been out of education for 3 years now with no A-levels (long depressing story) I’m very money driven although it’s not the be all and end all. My passion is scuba diving and I love the ocean environment. I also would like to make a series documentaries around diving, similar to BBC’s blue planet but more Centers around diving.

What I’m doing now and what I don’t like about it: I’m currently working for my dad in construction, I’m a labourer on £8.50 per hour, terrible money for the graft imo, it’s very tedious and I hate manual labour. I really hate the people I work with too, except for a minute few, they’re vulgar and extremely close-minded people. It’s a stressful and frustrating environment.

Now I’m not going to sugarcoat the fact that I was a spoiled kid, which I’m not blaming anyone for, my parents had a poor upbringing and didn’t want they’re children to experience the same lifestyle. So, it’s bittersweet, it definitely hasn’t helped me acclimatise to the “real world”.

I’m blabbing now but essentially I just want to earn a nice income, be independent and work with my passion. 

I’ve looked into marine biology and commercial diving, none quite fit the picture. Can anyone give me some advice on how to move forward?
It’s been 3 years and I’m in the same place as I was when I was in school. Thanks Reddit.

Tl;dr - I want a job in scuba diving, that pays well and I’m self employed (ideally). I can’t stand construction anymore.

I'm now 40 years old and I don't have a career in any single field.  I have multiple degrees in film and media.  I love stories and I love making people laugh.  I've worked in the film industry (couldn't stand it because my personality doesn't fit the ego and status driven culture), a small business in trading (I liked the autonomy but had no passion for selling merchandise), teaching (love working with children and I'm great at it but it gets exhausting), government (struggled with the bureaucracy but enjoyed the easy pace), animation production (being a small cog in a giant system made me depressed).  

I'm smart and hard-working so I generally succeed in whatever I do.  But I find that I always get tired of a job after a year or two and move on to something different.  I recently quit my animation job and thought that I wanted to pursue stand-up comedy professionally.  I do have a knack for it: performing, writing and comedy.  But after a few months of performing as an amateur, I now think this is something I'd like to pursue as a hobby and not an occupation.  

I recently took a Jackson Vocational Interest Survey and my top 3 interests are 1. social science, 2. professional advising and 3. performing arts.  

I'm now thinking that I'd like to work for a non-profit that helps youths.  I've always found it fulfilling to help youths to develop themselves and achieve their goals (mainly because this is what I wish I had when I was younger.) I'm hoping that if I pursue this line of work for income and pursue stand-up as a hobby that I'll be fulfilled spiritually, financially and creatively.  But I'm scared that even this I'll get tired of after a year or two and end up where I am now.

Are there other people like me?  Is my problem that I just haven't found a line of work that works for me - the assumption being that there is a ""right fit"" for everyone?  Or are there personalities that just gets bored easily and needs change every few years?  If so, what is the best way to deal with this type of problem?

What can I do to prove to graduate school that I deserve to be there?,careerguidance," I went to a top ten public University in the US and graduate with a Chemistry degree (Bachelor's) (GPA = 2.2)

It took me six years to graduate with that degree (including one year that I was academically dismissed and later reinstated)

I struggled mightily the entire time.

My first two years, I keep failing and repeating classes just to get by.

My third year, I was academically dismissed from my university.

I returned the fourth year and decided that I am going to live and breath chemistry and nothing else.

I woke up, eat breakfast, and study chemistry. Then I go to classes and study chemistry between classes. (I eat lunch while studying.) After that, I eat dinner and go to bed. Rinse and repeat.

When I said ""study"", I mean 80% reading (textbook, online papers from the professors, etc.) and 20% doing homework, lab report, etc.

Reading is just so time and energy consuming. I have to spend so much effort making sure that I am reading the right words that I often get ""lost"" in the text and forget what the text was saying.

I wasn't just my chemistry major classes that I was struggling with. I struggled with the general elective classes (literature, ethnic study, etc.)

My advisers sent me to skill classes (note taking classes, time management classes, etc) and they didn't help.

Finally, in my last term, I talked with my professor in a class I was struggling with.

I describe extensively how hard I try and how much time I spend studying. What he said changed my life.

He said that I probably have dyslexia and that his son has that.

I changed the way I study. I stopped retyping my notes after class, and instead, record lectures for later listening. Instead of reading texts, I use text to speech software to listen to text.

I initially thought that I would surely fail that class. I, instead, ended up with a B+.

In another class, I earned my first ever A+ in college.

Furthermore, with the change in the way I study, I feel that I didn't have to work as hard to earn a good grade. I was able to retain the material more easily and naturally.

It's a shame that I didn't figured this out earlier. (When I was using the more traditional methods taught in skill classes, I did poorly).

My undergraduate studies are over and I feel that my grades are not reflective of my abilities.

739,a72vz1,False,None,15,"Hiring managers and HR pros, how do you make salary, raise, and promotion decisions? What should I enforce as a manage and what should I expect as an employee?",careerguidance,"Hey all, let's talk salary. I have a few questions about how different companies set salaries and give raises and promotions. I'm keeping this as brief as possible, but am happy to add more color if needed.

1) Hiring Managers: how would you characterize your salary setting philosophy? Meaning, how much weight to you place on a new hire's individual skills & strengths vs their ""paper"" resume (their degree, their industry experience etc). Also, does this change when related to internal candidates where the candidate may have a great track record within the company and very concrete proven skills demonstrated during their employment thus far, but a weaker paper resume and less industry experience? 

2) Salary increases: I'll give an example here. I had two hires for the same position. I hired one in at a higher salary rate due to prior experience and a very strong resume, but the 2nd (more entry level in the industry, originally hired at a lower rate) is fantastic and quickly outpaced the more experienced hire.  Over 1+ year this employee has proven to be more productive, self driven and innovative, and has also taken on a bigger workload. I want to increase this 2nd hire's salary to be more comparable to the more experienced employee, but am getting pushback because this more entry level employee still technically has less experience. Is this normal? Or, as the hiring manager for this position, should I be pushing harder for a raise for this employee? Assume budget isn't a limiting factor here. 

3) Internal Promotions: I've seen my current company manage internal promotions in two different ways,  and I'm curious which is more common practice (or if both are used commonly, or something else)

Lets say a current employee proves their skills & worth and is clearly ready for a promotion. There is a larger role needed,  and the employee is a good fit for growth. Assume budget isn't the issue here, just employee development. Do you....

A) Offer the employee the additional responsibilities and a title change, as well as a salary bump.

The important thing to know is people talk about their rates, no matter what you tell them. So keeping your people whole is important, especially on a staff 20 to 50 people. If people aren't performing I will not give them a beg merit increase or raise and tell them why. I will give them something just not a lot. Because if your not pulling your weight and not turning it around the are other people that will want their job. 
Promotions I normally make when there is room and the person can fit the position, not wholly, on a basic level. I make the decision based on their prior work and performance.

740,a69yyj,False,None,22,What do I do if my boss offers me a new position with no raise but says that I'd be forced to resign if I refuse?,careerguidance,"Backstory:

I've been with this non profit organization for the last 2 years. I started as an Office Assistant but took on more duties that involved help in the administrative team. My duties evolved to the point that they decided to create a new title for me: Operations Specialist. This involves, IT support, systems management, Contact Resource Management, training new-hires, new hire paperwork, creating flyers and promotional materials for events, direct supervision of office assistant, compiling and reporting on data to our funders and contractors etc.

Today:

I was told this morning that they are going to move our current Office Manager to a different position and have me absorb her duties and her title. This means that, in addition to (most of) my current duties, I will be doing payroll, assisting in human resources, accounts payable, direct support for management, overseeing office supply inventory, answering all incoming phone calls, overseeing our incoming and outgoing mail, responding to our info@ emails, and be the contact person for all office staff for sick days and time off requests.

I asked what the new pay was going to be. I was told that I am already in the middle range of the new position so she wouldn't consider a pay raise discussion until 3 months. I asked if she would be flexible on that at all and was told that it's not in the budget at the moment and, because I will have to learn quickbooks, I don't have all of the job skills required yet anyway.

I asked what would happen if I decide the new position is not for me. I was told "" If you decided that it wasn't for you then I guess you are resigning.  We don't have any other positions open. ""

I have two questions: Can I get unemployment if I don't want the job? Have they done something wrong to me? I can't really figure it out. All I know is that I feel really hurt and don't feel like working here any more but can't seem to work out what specifically is making me feel that way. Any perspective you can provide would be most welcome. Thanks.

When I sent my resume for a drafter position I was very clear I had completed x credits in the architecture program in my home country, never said I had graduated. However, all my coworkers think I am an architect. I am doing very good here, I started with a low salary but now I make more money than all of them that are actual architects. I didn't do anything wrong, I never lied about it, they got it wrong for some reason. However, I did have the opportunity to correct them last time a new employee was being introduced to us and they said ""everyone in this row are architects"", but I didn't say anything. What should I do?

ps: by ""architect"" I mean bachelor in Architecture, not a licensed Architect.

**UPDATE**: Probably I wasn't clear enough or I shouldn't have used the term ""architect"". Here in the office, we all know that there is only one person who is the licensed architect. He is the one signing and stamping all architectural projects.

However, it's a common practice when introducing someone to call them ""architect"" or ""engineer"" even though they are not licensed. When referring to the licensed professional, we say ""he is the licensed architect"". I know this is technically wrong, but this is not the point here.

It’s their problem for misunderstanding and not your job to correct them. Sounds like you’re doing well.

Many of the licensed architects I’ve met are gatekeeping morons. Never lifted a hammer or understand what they’re ‘designing’.

742,dxnikc,False,None,33,Lost 39 year old looking for career advice (having never participated in the job market)?,careerguidance,"Hello,

I am at a crossroads in my life and feel pretty lost and deflated. I know nothing about starting a career and finding a job and I while I work myself into the matter, I am looking to you guys to maybe lend a helping hand.

I am a 39 year old lawyer living in Berlin, Germany. After graduating I worked as a self-employed lawyer for 2 years, realized I hated it and became a daytrader (for the last 2-3 years) hoping to achieve financial independence - this did not work out. I am now looking for a job to make a living and to be able to support my girlfriend and newborn son.

My days of self-actualization are over, pragmatism is the name of the game for me and I am willing to accept any sustainable compromise that brings in a paycheck.

Any insight from people familiar with the german job market will probably the most valuable, but I am sure some stuff is relatable across borders.

Problem is: I have no work experience and I am really old and my academical achievements are bad (bottom 10% bad).

A bit about myself and my interests: 

I studied philosophy, psychology and politics before swithching to law. This is where my interests mainly lie. Geostrategical stuff being the most applicable probably.

I am not very durable and stress-resistant. Any really horrible and draining jobs I can do for maybe 1-2 years, but no longer. I hope for a ""normal"" job, where the good and the bad even itself out and I can bear that for hopefully 5-10 years.

At the moment I think I should start to apply for everything I am remotely qualified for, even when chances are close to non-existent, starting with the jobs I like most and working myself down. I assume the search will take months, so stuff will pop up during my struggle.

The jobs I came up with myself are in order of attractiveness:

Jobs in the political field. I can only think of assistant to some elected politician of any level. 

Maybe political consultancy - but I do not think I am qualified for those.

Maybe some NGO, but I lack any commitment in volunteer work, internships etc., so I can not stand out.

Jobs in administration, probably municipal most likely, but I may be simply to old for that.

Lector for a scientific or academical publisher in law or financial.

Jobs in cultural institutions: assistant or some alw-realted stuff in theaters, museums and the like.

Legal custodian.

All assistant jobs in companies and public law institutions.

Do you guys have any further ideas or can give hints how I might improve my chances with the above jobs? Basically I am looking for jobs that pay well and do not require strong academical achievements.

I am also looking for help how to effectively find jobs and how to streamline my online profiles.

I think I found enough material on CV, cover letters and interviews - but if you guys have the ultimate guide, do not be shy, it is appreciated.

Thank you all very much!

I think my interpersonal skills when one on one or in a small group are ok, but I am deathly terrified of public speaking, or even speaking up in a medium sized meeting. Anytime I have to give a presentation, introduce myself publicly in front of a large group of people, or something similar, my heart begins to race and I have a panic attack where I'm short of breath and my voice is shaky. It's embarrassing because I don't have any mental anxiety about these situations, but its entirely physical and I have no control over it. It's like muscle memory.

&#x200B;

I have had a prescription for beta blockers which have been an absolute miracle and basically gotten rid of any anxiety symptoms when in these situations. I will still use them during major presentations, but I don't want to feel reliant on them, and would prefer to go through some sort or training that can rewire my brain into not becoming stressed in these situations. I'm about to graduate college and begin a great job in a major city in which I will often have to give presentations to clients, and I will be surrounded by a lot of type A corporate individuals. 

&#x200B;

At this point it's absolutely essential that I get over this and am able to assimilate into my new job seamlessly. Would joining a Toastmasters club or Dale Carnegie help? I figure that practice is what will help me get over it, by teaching my brain to become less stressed in these situations. Unfortunately, I am unable to take a public speaking course at my university. I checked a local community college, but was confused if I was able to enroll not being a student, and if what I found was even a legitimate course. I believe this form of social anxiety I have is probably my biggest weakness and a major barrier that once its overcome, will allow me to thrive professionally.

What the question is trying to ask is, say you have two jobs, A and B. And let's say they both pay the same, let's say $60K just for argument's sake. If you have two offers, you'll take the job that seems to have the best work, obviously.

But let's say B pays $65K. Do you automatically take B? Or do you take A if the work is clearly better? What if it's $70K? $80K? $100K?

The 'correct' answer - and by 'correct' I mean actually correct and not just 'interview correct' - is that you prefer the better job \_unless\_ the pay for that job is clearly not market, i.e., you're being taken advantage of. Now, it's incredibly unlikely that a job will both have good work and be making a substantially below market offer. So it's a pretty artificial question.

In every job I've had (1 consulting, 2 finance), I probably have 1-2 hours of real work to do each day but I am expected to keep the chair warm from 9 to 6. My team doesn't work in the same city as me, so I don't really understand why I need to be in the office. I've tried to create my own projects in every job, but (1) we are a regulatory function and there isn't much to add; and (2) I'm there to complete work that needs done, not dream up time-wasting projects to look busy with. 

The people in my office are on other teams so we don't have anything to talk about. They are also in very different life stages than me. We say hi but that's about it.

The usual advice in this situation seems to be ""use that free time to study for your next job."" Well I have been studying for the past 3 years post-grad, and that's exactly how I got this job. It's just going to get me into a different variant of this situation. Let me know which jobs don't require 9-6 desk sitting for statistical modelers and I'll definitely start studying.

I don't want to sit at a desk doing nothing all day. It's pointless, unhealthy, and rather lonely. My reviews are positive as when there is work, I do it quickly and with good quality. There just isn't enough work. 

This results in me trying to look busy all day when I'm really staring into space. I don't want another job in my field because they are all the like this (I'm on my 3rd one now) and I don't want to switch fields because I'd likely end up in the same situation for a lot less pay.

Is there a way to negotiate this diplomatically?,careerguidance,"I am a sr. associate level employee working for a small-ish company. A few weeks ago, it was mentioned that executives and director-level employees may be forced to take a pay cut to keep the company afloat. However, today it was announced that all employees will see a 20% pay cut starting in a few weeks.

I am currently one of the lowest paid employees in the company and absolutely will not be able to afford the cost of living in my area if my salary is reduced by 20%. I met with my boss to ask whether the exec team could consider a lower percentage cut (like 10 or 15%) for employees making below a certain salary/seniority level. The company is small, so there are only a handful of associate level employees to whom this exception would apply. He was pretty negative towards the idea saying that it’s “tough for everyone right now” and that it’s “only fair” for everyone to make the same sacrifice.

But the thing is... we’re not really all making the same sacrifice. While I am grateful to have a job during this situation, a 20% cut for my boss and other senior level employees is probably a “sacrifice.” On the other hand, a 20% reduction for those of us at the bottom is a make or break difference. Honestly, when the office reopens, Im not even sure if I’d be able to afford the cost of my commute anymore on this reduced salary.

763,9y4oky,False,None,36,I want to escape my desk job and find something meaningful. Any suggestions?,careerguidance," 

I am 25 and have been working as a digital designer for 3 years in advertising and design firms. I am looking for a complete career change but don’t know where to begin. I'm feeling pretty lost and getting anxious and overwhelmed.

In my 3 years working as a designer I have grown to find the work unrewarding, meaningless, and not stimulating. Gradually my dissatisfaction with my career has lead me into an existential crisis and depression.

I have decided that I no longer want a desk/ office job that requires you to work on the computer majority of the day as I find it is not stimulating for me. I hate sitting in the same office behind a screen every day.

I want to find a non-desk job that is meaningful and rewarding. Something that I can be passionate about and feel good for contributing to the greater good of the world. Something that has good career trajectory - good potential to progress in my career and earn more as I get older. I would love to be working outdoors some of the time or at least moving around, not sitting at a desk.

I am particularly interested in the idea of doing environmental work of some sort - maybe forestry or wildlife conservation. I would also consider humanitarian or even social work.

I have a Bachelor of Design and would be willing to do further studies for up to 2 years to make me qualified for my dream job, whatever it may be.

The hard part is that I have not done maths or science further than junior high school so I can’t get into a Masters Degree that has prerequisites of maths and science.

I have considered carpentry and other trades, but I think I want to find something more meaningful that is having a positive impact rather than just just building houses or commercial buildings. Although, I think I would like to be working with my hands or doing technical work of some sort.

I have also considered fireman and paramedic jobs but I don’t think I would cope well with the stress and traumatic situations they have to deal with.

I have been looking for quite a while at possible career options or further studies but I am really stumped for answers. 

I struggle with anxiety and I am getting quite overwhelmed when searching and not seeming to make much progress so that is why thought I would try posting here to see what suggestions people have.

Does anyone out there have any ideas of cool jobs that I could look into or further studies that I could do to help me in the right direction?

Or has anyone gone through a similar experience with wanting a complete career change, to ditch their desk job and find something more fulfilling?

If you have any suggestions at all, please throw them down. I just want to get as many ideas as possible.

765,binfaf,False,None,21,"Company refuses to promote worthy people, forces them out, then advertises their job at higher grade. Why?",careerguidance,"I work for a large engineering firm in the UK.

The company has a culture whereby effective, valuable and worthy candidates for promotion can spend months - or even years - operating at the level of the grade above, but simultaneously being denied a promotion.

The usual outcome to this is that the employee in question gets fed up and either moves role internally or leaves the business, after which the company invariably re-advertises their position **at the higher grade anyway**.

I have been with the company for 8 years now and have seen this happen time and time and time again. 

The obvious explanation is that the personnel asking for promotion are effectively ""dead wood"", and the managers are happy to see the back of them, or that they feel it is an opportunity to bring in outside talent. However, this is not the case. The ones being pushed to leave are often the hardest working and most ambitious, and usually have very niche and specialised knowledge/experience.

767,f01re3,False,None,21,How to transition out of a higher ed career?,careerguidance,"Hey all - a little background here: I've been working higher education since shortly after I graduated from college in December 2014. I started out in January 2015 as an administrative assistant for the Student Services dept at a university, and then in August 2017, I received a reclassification in the same dept to student programs advisor. My pay went up 7% with this change. This reclassification came about because my initial work duties went from basic scheduling of meetings, minimal event planning, and handling of communication (emails, phone calls) to extensive data reports for departments, meetings with student organizations regarding university events and adherence to policies, and supervision of a student computer lab and team of student workers. I received my Master in Education in May 2019 while working full time because my university offered a tuition benefit.

However, I have come to realize in the five years I've been working at this university that I prefer the administrative angle of my job much more than the student focused portion of my job (direct advising). I enjoy tracking data, creating data reports, coordinating meetings/events (working with vendors, monitoring budgets, serving as the point of contact, etc), streamlining processes (a lot of things went from paper to digital as a result of changes I made), and just generally I enjoy being someone who pulls the strings behind the scenes vs someone who meets with students daily. Also, I've come to realize how severely underpaid I am given my experience and credentials-I live in a big city and it's very hard getting by on my current salary. My current job is unable to offer me a raise despite my master's degree so I am looking to move on very soon.

I would like to make the jump into something strictly administrative such as executive assistant, office coordinator, office manager, etc and I am looking outside the university setting. I have a lot of friends in office jobs that are being paid more than I am (with less work experience and no master's); I'm in my mid-20s and I want to make this career change now.

Does anyone here have any experience making a similar career jump from higher ed into another industry?

768,e6hi4c,False,None,50,What can a recently moderately crippled person realistically do for work?,careerguidance,"I'm a 27 year old male who recently went through some health issues the past year and a half. I never got sick never had as much as a broken bone. Was completely healthy, lifting, running, skateboarding, and playing basketball 4 to 6 times a week with a moderately physical job. Over the course of one weekend a year and a half ago I started to become weaker and weaker from Friday to Sunday . Friday being the last time I could do all those things I listed before and Sunday to complete paralysis. After going to the emergency room, it was determined that I had Guillian-Barre syndrome. Guillian-Barre is the peripheral nerve equivalent to multiple sclerosis. However the only positive thing about Guillian Barre is that it is a self limiting syndrome and I will eventually get most innervation of the nerves back, as the peripheral nervous system does have the ability to regenerate itself unlike the central nervous system. Being completely paralyzed, everyone was doing everything for me. I could not feed myself, bathe myself, dress myself, let alone sit up in a chair for more than 10 minutes without needing to lay back down. It affected my eyes too where I was seeing double for about 3 to 4 months. Luckily most of the stuff has resolved itself. I am able to dress , bathe, feed/cook for myself and family now as well as most other occupational things. The hardest part now is getting the rest back. With Guillian-Barre, the symptoms start distally and end proximally upon contraction of the acute phase of the disease. When reinnervation occurs, it does so in the opposite fashion. So now everything on me distally is very weak. (Hands, forearms, calves, feet). I can walk but only short distances because my upper legs are working very hard to compensate what my lower legs are not able to do. Even typing, as I type this right now I have to switch back and forth with voice dictation and typing as my hands get very fatigued. Another thing to know about this disease is that there are different variants with varying degrees of severity. Instead of getting the normal Guillian-Barre which is prominent in North America and still a 1 in 100,000 chance and has the best recovery outcome, I got the variant that is prominent in Asian countries which has the worst recovery outcome. I have never left the East Coast of the United States which still baffles me today. I am also fairly tall as well 6 foot 3 inches so if you think about it the taller you are the longer your nerves the longer the recovery. Nerves recover at a rate of 1-5mm/ day which is like 1-4in/month so if im 75 inches from had to toe then… well you can do the math.

With all that being said, I am posting this in this subreddit today because I really need a job. When you're a single white male with no children there is virtually no help at all that you can get from government aids. The only thing I am surviving on now is the little bit of savings that I built up while I was working and Social Security disability which is not enough to survive on. However, I'm at a loss with what I can do. I really don’t think I could keep up with a 9 to 5 job going in every day with the fatigue factor of this disease. So I would really like to work from home. When exploring jobs at home most of them are on the Phone which require you to be able to type as well. As I mentioned before I have to switch back and forth between voice dictation and typing as again the fatigue of typing tires my hands. If I am on the Phone with someone I will not be able to use voice dictation.

I'm kind of at a loss for where else to look and honestly the great people on reddit have given me advice and information in the past on other things that were useful. Also, if I am not in the right subreddit maybe someone could point me in to one that would be better suited for this question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e6hi4c/what_can_a_recently_moderately_crippled_person/,72,"You could try teaching English online!

I didn't pass probation. It was an economist position. I'm new to the workforce, been working since graduation for ~11 months.

I feel some of it was my fault, but some of it was not. I did my best, and thought i was doing well. I could do things that others there couldn't do. I met deadlines (where they were given to me). I learnt R on the job, and in a month i could write complex geospatial analyses in R to help with evidence-building to work out effective consumer choice.

But around 3 months into the job it looks like (and only on the last day did i realise) management was assembling evidence to boot me out. A report was drafted and the managers agreed i should not pass probation.

Comments made to me were:

* Couldn't get a piece of R  work done on time (the code was done by another team member and malfunctioning. Worse still, another team member left it half done and didn't touch it for a month. I was effectively blamed for that.)
* Didn't understand a concept around a productivity measure (i did, but the data i relied on another organisation to give it to me was never there - so i tried alternative measures which didn't make sense)
* Inability to let things go (true - i kept thinking someone had a problem with me so i made sure i didn't do something wrong by accident)
* Asked too many questions (could have told me to stop, and would have)
* Attention to detail lacking sometimes (in the cases they raised, they said it was ""fine""...ugh)

Some things said of me wasn't really true, so i think a part of it was that i didn't click with the team (esp. the managers).

But i don't care about blaming people. I care about making sure this never happens again. How do i reflect on this?

I have interviews lined up, and i'm actually in close contention for one position (they didn't get this employer's reference and accepted the reason i gave - which technically is not a lie). 

How can i be sure if i get a similar position, i don't fuck it up? I can't bear giving up on an economist career (at least for a while) after this failure, but is being an economist even right for me?

I initially thought I wanted to go to pharmacy school but changed my mind after finishing the prerequisites & working a couple years as a full time pharmacy technician. At that age I wasn’t motivated by money (I am now) and felt like I would be bored to death performing quality control on medications everyday. Soooo it was a NO for me. Instead of quitting altogether, 3 years in, I made the decision to at least finish what I’d started and spend my 4th year putting my credits towards a biology degree. (Full disclosure, Low scores on the PCAT exam & HIGH stress levels trying to study and balance life played a role in this choice...) Fast forward to today, I cannot see myself going back to school to do anything else in the healthcare industry. Just watching shows like greys anatomy or botched and the thought of more student loans make me VERY nauseous. 


Prior to college and since graduating, I’ve had various roles in hospitality/customer service: cooking, hosting, catering, serving, bottle service/bartending, etc and have been lucky enough to keep a position as a flight attendant for the past 6 years. 
In the beginning, it was GREAT! I traveled the world and never really saw it as “work” but for the past almost 3 years, that’s changed drastically & I’ve had a daily internal struggle over what else I can do with my life. The actual job itself is EASY but the lack of sleep = constant jet lag, living out of a suitcase, time alone/away from loved ones, and just having to be personable all the time is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I’m depressed and I know it’s because of my current lifestyle. I used to just enjoy my time alone at home on days off but I’ve become such an introvert that I barely want to leave the house/hotel rooms or talk to anyone now at all unless I HAVE to. Im never rude to passengers and have a perfect attendance record, but when I work with so many bubbly personalities and see people who genuinely want to go above and beyond inflight, it just confirms even more that this role isn’t for me anymore. I’m not sure if I’m just getting older and care more about consistency, stability, & work/life balance or just bored with life in general and need to stick with something that will stimulate my mind. I wish I had some sort of passion I could be pursuing in my down time, but I don’t. I thought about teaching and became a substitute for a year but couldn’t see it as a long term career either. I’m afraid I have already become complacent like many of my colleagues who’ve been flying an average of 20-40 years yet have the same complaints I do. With everything being seniority based, they say things get better with time but I’m not convinced. Also I barely use my flight benefits so they aren’t a factor keeping me “stuck” 


I STAY on indeed & the career section of so many companies & apply for jobs constantly but I’m also constantly rejected for positions I’m qualified to do (flight attendant supervisor, recruiter, instructor, anything hotel related etc) and I don’t have the experience or education required for anything outside this field paying a decent salary ($60k +). My degree is pretty much useless other than the fact that it shows I’m “smart” but clearly not smart enough to figure out a better life path. Anyone I’ve ever confided in has said “you’ll figure it out eventually” but like I said, it’s been years and I still haven’t found my calling. I’m grateful for the paycheck/benefits and understand that many ppl do not ENJOY their jobs but my job has become my entire life and I’m no longer enjoying much of it at all.

I am at a small (<30 people) company. For the sake of this, let's say I'm a ""Financial Analyst II."" I started as a Jr Financial analyst. In the short 2 years, I have gotten several significant pay bumps, got positive praise, etc. I am doing fairly serious work for someone that's 25. Worth noting that from the start, I never planned to spend my whole career here. 

Outside of some minor gripes that could happen anywhere, my company is pretty awesome. My pay package is awesome. The working hours aren't terrible. And it means something that the higher ups have specifically made a focus of ensuring I get taken care of.

At the same time, I just feel totally checked out as of late. I can't really find the motivation to be *truly* interested in my job this point. I don't feel like I'm learning any new tangible skills. I don't really feel like I'm getting any mentorship for what I want to do. None of the people around me are really on the same career 'track' I'd like to be on. Plus, a lot of the processes in my small company just feel very ""Mickey Mouse.""

I'm hesitant to up and leave. Since my job is fairly good, and my particular industry is pretty niche, good opportunities don't come up all the time. I would consider going back for an advanced degree, but it would likely not get me higher pay than I'm getting right now. And the other option is going into a 'professional services' job in consulting or finance (I should be qualified), but I'd be going in fairly entry level, and likely getting paid a bit less for way more stress.

Alright so most subjects in school didn't really interest me. I only liked Dutch, English and art. Unsurprisingly, my grades were quite bad. Luckily they were good enough to pass. 
After my graduation I had no idea what to study so I took a gap year and started working at Burger King (very impressive, I know). After a year I decided I wanted to study social work. Well that didn't work out for someone with social anxiety like me. I also didn't really enjoy the classes. After quitting I went back to working at the lovely burger heaven. I couldn't really stand that for much longer, so I started studying again. I picked goldsmithing for this. Yes, that made sense to me. See, I've always loved drawing and painting so I figured I'd do something creative. But I didn't enjoy the sawing, soldering and all the other technical aspects of the subject. After quitting I started working at a factory to ""save up"". Note: I used to spend my money like you would spend the toilet paper after eating an extra spicy burrito. At this point I went through a couple of miserable months. I eventually ended up at the airport with only 100 euros, about to go to Madrid. If it wasn't for my ex who stopped me, I would probably still be bathing in some Spanish ditch right now. Anyway, after this fiasco my friend suggested I should go for a course that allows me to only attend school once a week, while working the other 4 days. This seemed perfect for me since I would be able to achieve a certificate by experiental learning. The only subject that offers this kind of education here is cooking so I went with it. Bad decision once again, because man... I am way too dreamy and inattentive for this kind of job. It's also very exhausting and I get no free time anymore. So now, at the age of 20, I'm considering quitting again and starting a graphic design course, because I truly love design and I can seriously stare at a computer screen for lifetimes, trying to create a perfect photograph or logo. I also have a great passion for photography, but a lot of people can't really earn a living with that so I go for graphic design. I am really unsure about this though, because I'm afraid I will dislike this as well. Is quitting again a good idea, or will this just cause me to become used to giving up, rather than fighting? If I go for a new start, how could I get myself to make it work this time? Also, would it be a good idea to study the subject abroad?

I've also never had a conversation that he didn't aggressively brag during.  Whatever the topic he relays it back to his resume, ""years of experience,"" and ""degree in X."". Fine things to say for a job interview, but he was hired over a year ago and still talks about his resume every conversation.  His skills do look better on the resume than in real life.  

He'll say things that are objectively wrong, but sound technical so no one but me understands that it's b.s.  

He's very protective of his work and hiding it from the review/QA of others.  But he also sticks his nose in other people's work, micromanages his reports, and tries to micromanage people who aren't his reports.

My mom wants to go back to school - she is 42, she's been a stay at home mom/housewife for over 20 years. No college degree. She's likely divorcing my dad in a few years...and will need to have a career/income/life of her own.

I'm hand-holding her through this whole process because she's overwhelmed and of course I'd do anything to get her where she needs to be. We're torn between two career paths for her - teacher or nurse.

The way I see it, teacher = 4 yr degree, testing, then employment at an elementary school - she loves children, the hours are pretty nice, summers off, decent benefits. Yeah, teacher salaries are pretty low, but she'd only be supporting herself. I'm a substitute teacher and I think it is so rewarding and fun and I know she'd be great at it, she agrees.

Nursing is something she's been vaguely interested in for a while, and she could get an Associate's in nursing, start working, and work on her Bachelor's while she does so. The money is about the same between teacher and ADN, but better if she has a BSN. Other than that idk much else about nursing. Personally I wouldn't like working in a hospital poking people with needles but she thinks she would love to work maybe in midwifery/maternal/neonatal care.

I am trying the best I can to lay out a very detailed timeline of what EXACTLY she needs to do to pursue either of these, starting with testing, pre-reqs, admission to a degree program, and everything leading up to employment, and the lifestyle with it.

For a back story, here’s some things I’ve done and decided it wasn’t for me after doing it for a time. 

Rave DJ - ended up parting and getting wasted to much to not die before I hit 30. Not a productive lifestyle when your 19.

Army medic - I was good at it but wasn’t full bought in on the military life style. After 10 months of sitting on a random base in Kuwait   during deployment decided not to re-enlist.

Asbestos and mold testing field tech - ok income but the job got super boring after a year and a half. Also decided that my income was pretty much as high as I was gonna make without a degree.

Golf Coarse Manager - it’s a chill college job but no interest in doing this long term. I also hate golf after dealing with golfers all day.

Currently going to school for criminal justice on GI bill but the program is to easy and feel like I’m just using the degree to try to get into a better masters program. Not as interested in becoming a police officer as I was 2 years ago. Can’t really change majors without paying for classes on GI bill so finishing it out. 

Anyways, feel like I’m being more proactive than just sitting around but still yet to find something that I actually enjoy. Hoping for some tips from people to find something that is actually meaningful and will pay the bills. I don’t feel like I’m lazy or anything but I’ve never worked a job I actually enjoyed.

But it’s extremely stressful, not much work satisfaction, and lawyers are 3x more likely to suffer from depression (me being one of them). The pay is not enough for most lawyers to pay down their loans at the rate that those loans are growing with interest. Hours are long, you are almost always expected to work longer than everyone else and in litigation, you have unexpected late nights regularly. As a mom, this is extremely difficult because I have daycare pick up, so causes an issue with my husband’s work schedule. The worst part of litigation IMO is that your opponents are out to crush you in order to win, and that creates a very combative and hostile work environment. It takes a certain personality to be a bulldozer. As for non-lit jobs, I never chose to do them because what I have been exposed to I’ve found dreadfully boring.

797,fhgdqm,False,None,27,how do you identify a bad boss in an interview?,careerguidance,"I know there are some obvious red flags like overtly being rude or being arrogant. Are any good questions to ask to reveal a bad boss that might not be as obvious ?

Everyone I have ever spoken to has only had good things to say about my boss. Including people that do not work at the company now but worked for him before. But after working for him a while, I finally know his real nature. He is a really nice guy and very personable, but he looks out only for himself. He is quick to place blame on others, especially those he manages, and does not share proper credit with his team when things go well. He does not stick up for his team and does not share opportunities for growth- instead he keeps those opportunities for himself and keeps them secret. He does not adequately thank his team for their hard work and basically wants to make sure that he is seen as the ""rockstar"" of the group while the rest of us are his little minions.

Are there any questions I could have asked during the interview process or anything else I could have done to get hints at these traits beforehand?

2. Boss man knows you did your research and you're already looking for the best ways to help out

819,eannqb,False,None,75,"What is a job that best meets these three parameters (if such a job exists): low-stress, well-paying, and in demand?",careerguidance,"I know these parameters may seem impossible to meet, but I like to think my threshold for each is fairly low.

**Low-stress**: No crazy hours (late night, tons of overtime). No taking work home. Not super fast-paced. Not hard on the body/labor-intensive.

**Well-paying**: At least 50-60K a year.

**In demand**: Not impossible to find a job and, given enough time, should reasonably expect to be able to find a job at some point.

A bit more about my situation. I'm about to finish a student teaching practicum, and unfortunately I'm starting to see what teachers and former teachers mean when they rave against the terrible work/life balance of the job.

I love the actual act of teaching: being in the classroom with students, getting to know them, discussing interesting topics. They can be a bit unruly at times, but so was I in high school so I find it endearing even as I struggle to keep them orderly. But all the grading, lesson planning, contact with parents is just too much and the work day is never really over even after the last bell rings. I know I'll be burnt out by everything *around* teaching if I continue with it.

Long story short, I'm providing this background for a **fourth parameter: ideally this job won't send me back to school for a terribly long time.** I already have a Bachelor's, though it is in the humanities. An Associate's would be ideal, but wouldn't be opposed to something requiring a Bachelor's or Master's if I can more easily make the jump because of the credits I have from my Bachelor's, though I'm not sure how that works.

Essentially, I'm done chasing a dream job, which I thought teaching would be for me. I just want something that meets those three parameters above, and ideally the fourth parameter too because I've already been in school for a while, racked up debt, and just want to enter the working world ASAP so I can start making money.

Sucks that I kind of have to start over on my career like this, but I figure it's best to be honest with myself now than hate my life later because I've locked myself into a miserable occupation. If nothing else, I've at least gained a new understanding of myself and what I want in life. Sometimes you can't figure that out without some trial and error.

I'll likely just do the presentation begrudgingly. I had a mini presentation that went well today which has given me some better feelings towards it.

However, I don't think people should be pushed to do what they don't want to do and they should create their own goals with their managers, not have things foisted upon them. Allowing people to grow at their own pace within their own bounds is crucial for authentic, healthy development.

Also there's a difference between being encouraged and being carelessly pushed.

Thanks to the nice people who commented!

I have manageable but very present social anxiety and despite this have taken on more and more team and client presentations over the past year.

I'm a 22 year old disabled young woman. It's a really long story and I don't want to bore everyone with trivial knowledge of my past. So the gist of my story is that I missed almost all of high school due to being very ill and hospitalized (I was given a month to live). I was told to not to go back to school because of how sick I was at the time but I did go back and got 24 credits in 10 months and got my high school diploma. After that I attempted to go to a local College but it was a terrible experience and I was yelled at by professors for being so disabled and when I tried to take a medical withdrawal they did not reimburse my money. I cannot use my right arm at all even though I used to be right handed I can use my left hand type but cannot write. I used to have dreams of becoming a forensic psychologist before I got sick but that takes years of post secondary education. I am currently unable to go to post-secondary education due to lack of funds and I cannot get a job due to my disabilities and so I have no way of saving money. My interests have always been either forensic psychology or history related. Before I got sick I was at a runway model because my mother was living out her childhood dreams vicariously through me. I never really liked modelling because I have always tended to be more scientific minded and despise the idea of fashion and all that. But I cannot even pursue Runway modelling anymore. Due to my disabilities, I can't walk in heels anymore.

TLDR Basically I'm a 22 year-old disabled ex model just looking to find a passion in life because right now my life seems like it's lacking purpose.

I've been at this company for a couple of years now and have a very good track record (promoted twice, good relationships, etc). We have our performance reviews coming up and I asked my boss how he thinks I'm doing because I'm eligible for a promotion. I've been running the team in the absence of a manager while he was in training and learning about the company and I think I did a really good job of setting targets, delivering on all the goals and so on. No one in my team has done the amount of work I've done in such a short time.

My boss told me that he didn't think I did enough to be promoted and said he didn't know I was thinking about a promotion even though I brought it up several times over the past couple months. OK, no problem, I was thinking maybe me running the team on my own and making sure that the team performed very high in the absence of a manager wasn't good enough so I'll just have to work harder.

826,bsoxe2,False,None,46,My mom and stepdad (early fifties) are poor and unskilled—what can they do to make more money?,careerguidance,"Hello,

I'm not asking for advice for myself but rather my mom and stepdad, who are in their early fifties. They're both immigrants from Vietnam. My mom came here about 25 years ago. She's currently a citizen and can speak enough English to communicate but not understand grammar or more technical things. She does nails at a nail shop owned by her friend, but business is extremely slow. My stepfather came here just two years ago. He doesn't speak English and currently works for minimum wage at a Chinese restaurant. They make under $30,000 a year combined.

What should they do at their age and skill level to make more money and improve their lives? My mom could make a lot more money if she worked at another nail shop, but she doesn't want to do anything besides manicures and pedicures because doing fake nails requires use of harmful chemicals, although it makes more money. I think she's counting on my uncle, her brother, to help her buy her own nail shop. He's an occupational therapist and makes decent money, but there's no guarantee he'll help her. Also, he's out of work at the moment.

My stepdad seems to have settled in to his minimum wage restaurant job. He has a license to do nails, but he doesn't seem interested in it. He probably should have gone for a hair cutting license, but they decided against it for some reason.

I was thinking (although maybe it's not too realistic) that my mom could take English classes and then attend college to get a degree in something, like nursing.

I do it on the side because I really really enjoy it.  When I joined another professional joined and we have taught together over the last several semesters.  After the first semester I was asked to coordinate for the course, basically insure that all the sections were the same--i.e. students got the same content regardless of professor.  Both of us have very different styles, but in the end we teach the same material.

&#x200B;

Early on I recognized that our course needed updates, I worked with admin and got those updates implmented.  Needless to say, those changes have not been well received.  I solicited the other professor for feedback on numerous occasions without success, so in essence all changes were my changes.  Now with all of the new material, I get passive aggressive messages about when are we going to stop changing (with cc to multiple admin levels for the tiniest detail).  Also the individual has stopped communicating directly with me.

&#x200B;

Here's my conundrum--this person is a C-level executive at their normal job and I am basically a peon.  They bring a ton of prestige to the program, while I bring only my wit and excitement for teaching.  In addition to the above, there are several 'unprofessional' behaviors (nothing scandalous, this is academia, so just think 'rude') I have observed during conferences--this person is obviously aware of their import and like to remind everyone of it.

My admin is sympathetic to my plight, but I know that the students sense the friction (he \[ed. sorry typo\] openly badmouth me in his classes, perhaps forgetting that everything is recorded, and me watching his videos is my way of making sure we are synched, while I release my notes/slides/videos to all sections) and our teaching has diverged to the point where he blew off the final I wrote, something I was very passionate about as it gave our students some real-world style experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b44xq3/what_is_the_best_way_to_handle_a_highly/,69,Quick answer: murder then take it over his duties  ,2019-03-22 13:14:25

Odd stuff occurred as well, hiring manager called me and said headhunter asked him to give me a call, “he didn’t really know why” and then said, “do you have specific questions on your offer?”

The job is at a small law firm, and I was hired to run the blog, help draft damages letters, and so on. 

A few weeks ago, things were going well. I was writing regular blog content and spicing up things that needed to be sent to defendants or shown in court. It took a bit of a learning curve, but I was completely on top of it. 

Then my boss decided our website needed a redesign. I thought he'd outsource the design and have me write the site text. I showed him some other sites I thought were well designed and pointed out how design language could be used to engage potential clients. Suddenly I was in charge of the design. 

Right away, I told him that despite having some limited knowledge of good UX principles, I was not qualified to do an entire website. He told me that I'm ""smarter than I think."" 

Now I've been working on the site for a few weeks. I got him to let me use a pretty dumbed down website building tool so that it would look nice despite the fact that this isn't something I've done before. He keeps asking me to add in animations and build pages that a) this building tool doesn't allow for and b) that I wouldn't know how to create even if it did. 

Every time I present something to him, he wants something even more technically impressive. I keep coming just close enough to what he previously wanted for him to up the ante again. 

He also asked me to design an entire digital marketing strategy spanning multiple domains we own, and including ads etc.

I'll say it again. I am a writer. I write a lot, and I write well, but I am not a visual creative, nor a programmer, nor a web expert. At this point I'm barely doing any of the things I was initially hired to do.

834,cy37hr,False,None,12,Unclear how to ask for a raise in my circumstance?,careerguidance,"I have been working at my current employer for about 11 months and since the beginning of this year, my duties and responsibilities have changed dramatically. Although the salary I was brought in at was competitive for the duties the old job description entailed, my new “title” and responsibilities can command quite a bit higher (30% or more) should I shop around.

The way I see it, I have 3 obstacles that I can’t think of ways around:

1) The raise I’m looking for would require a corporate paygrade promotion also (I believe). I honestly would feel awkward even asking for that number

2) My performance review is at least another 3 months away and my employer does not really have a very clear policy on how raises and promotions will work. Especially since a colleague of mine (who has been working with the employer for 10 yrs) mentioned that when she asked for a raise, she only mentioned her intentions to our direct supervisor and then spoke directly to the department head for her raise.

3) Timing. We had just finished Phase 1 (where I contributed quite a bit especially since my direct supervisor was on maternity and I handled part of her work then) a pretty long term three phase project, however an audit is beginning soon and won’t end for another month. All “raise/promotion” asking advice seem to revolve around finding the right time to ask which given how many projects are down the line, is difficult for me to pick out.

Normally I wouldn’t think this would be a problem, but the friend I helped interview for the same position as my new title might officially begin by October and I’m worried that with his closer to market salary, there might not be room in the budget for them to give me the raise I want (this fear may or may not be unfounded, I actually don’t know what it looks like from the other side).

This is actually the first time I’ve ever asked for a raise, as usually when I feel underpaid, I just move on to a different position (usually with a better title also) so any additional insights would be most appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cy37hr/unclear_how_to_ask_for_a_raise_in_my_circumstance/,69,Only way to get a raise in todays world is via landing a new job. ,2019-09-01 00:20:36

838,a353oy,False,None,63,"Should I dump my current somewhat stressful job with better pay and rotating schedule for a 9-5 M-F, less stressful job with a $400/month pay cut?",careerguidance,"I (25F) am a respiratory therapist at a huge hospital in South Carolina currently. I’ve been here for a year and a half (only RT job I’ve had). It’s primarily critical care and has a children’s side to. I work in both areas with a passion for pediatrics. The schedule is nice sometimes- 12 hour shifts but I only work 3 per week and off 4. But we’re required to work every other weekend. My boyfriend whom I live with and will soon be engaged/married to (within the next year or two) works 9-5 M-F. All weekends and holidays off. A lot of the weekends I work we want to do things together. Or go to things in th evenings but I don’t get off until 7. This isn’t a job I want to do forever but it pays decent. It’s very high stress and takes a toll on you emotionally. I see people take their last breaths regularly. It has a high burn out rate. 

A position opened up within my hospital group but it is an outpatient facility. It’s in their pediatric Pulmonology department. I would never work with critically ill, dying people. This is basically a regular doctors office but for strictly Pulmonology patients. It’s something I would LOVE to do. It’s 9-5 M-F. Boyfriend and I would share schedules. It’s a job I could see myself doing long term. I interview for it tomorrow. I may not even be offered it but if I am I need to be prepared with how to process it. The big kicker with this is I would take a $400/month pay cut. I have about $23,000 in student loan debt and about $12,000 in other debts. No mortgage or rent. I pay about $600 to loans monthly which is above minimum. All loans are 6% apr or lower. It’s a huge loss when I have so much debt I’m paying down. But it’s low stress, highly sought after, low burnout. People literally retire in this position. 

Do I suffer the pay cut and make it work? I can always pick up random Saturday shifts in critical care and make about $220 in one day. Those shifts may or may not always be available. But more than likely they will be. I could pick a Saturday, or a Sunday even, boyfriend and I have no plans and pick up money. That just puts me at working 6 days a week to make ends meet while I’m currently working 3. 

I’m just having a hard time weighing out the pros and cons. They’re about equal, but it’s basically finances vs mental well being. 

Edit: I feel it is safe to mention I DO like my current job. I have some great coworkers. It can be strenuous at times and mentally exhausting but very rewarding. If I absolutely hated it the decision wouldn’t be so hard. But I know I’d love this other position 10x more. And not come home mentally and physically exhausted everyday. 



Update:
The manager called me with an unofficial offer and do to some credentials I carried, it bumped my job code up and increased my starting pay to almost what I make now. It’s maybe 80c per hour different. However I will work 4 extra hours a week and end up breaking even. My decision was made for me!

As of right now we're operating on a take-out only model and running a full menu with 2 to 3 people in the building. My stress level is through the roof, I work in an industry where I am at very high risk of contracting the virus, and amount of work that it is taking to run a full menu restaurant with minimal help is destroying me. 

My corporate office today informed me that they will be increasing my required hours to 60 hours per week while also cutting my salary by 40%

The pay I will be receiving equates to exactly minimum wage, if I were to work only 40 hours per week. The issue is that I'll be working 60 and won't be compensated at all for the work that I'm putting in. From what I understand, since i am a salaried employee and what they're doing is entire legal, but unbelievably unfair. 

The way this was done, I feel like I have been backed into a corner. I'm a recent college grad with a crippling amount of student loan debt and my unemployment would be based off of my college job, which was for significantly less money. I'm genuinely concerned about my availability to pay my bills and eat now, but the hours I'm being forced to work makes it impossible to find a second job. 

They gave me the option of being ""laid off"" and coming back once we reopen, but I'm fearful that they will try to drive me out if I chose to do that.

I can't just quit because I wouldn't be eligible for unemployment. I don't want to make this anymore difficult on my co-workers, but I'm trying to keep my mind open to all options. 

I feel like my only option is to ride this out for the reduced pay but I'm really struggling with the idea of working for a company that would do this to the handful of remaining employees that they have left. I honestly feel like them laying me off would have been a more satisfactory option for me.

In the grand scheme of things, I can't see myself wanting to work for a company that would respond in this way. I feel like regardless of my immediate decision I will try to find a new position at a new spot ASAP, but what would you do?

841,egcnqr,False,None,44,Should I take a better paying job or be a “team player”?,careerguidance,"Throwaway to keep this off my main.

I (26F) have been working full time for a non-profit for 1.5 years.  

A few details about this job:

-pay is about $1,500 less annually than a living wage for a single adult in my city.  I have to work another (better paying) job part time to make ends meet/have any quality of life.  HOWEVER, we are getting a pay increase

-this position has had an extreme amount of turnover in the past few years. It’s on a small team which was being hired from scratch when I got there, because the previous team all quit within a few months.  More have quit since then

-the managers who have overseen all this turnover have been the same. It’s a small department, but my team works closely with our manager and her boss.  

-These two supervisors have very different management styles.  My direct supervisor (let’s call her Kim) is extremely lax, and likes to leave policies in gray areas.  Overall, I like Kim as a person, but this has been frustrating to work under since Kim’s boss, we’ll call her Kath, has extremely specific expectations of her staff.  Kath also really likes to stick to chain of command, thereby relying entirely on Kim to communicate Kath’s expectations to my team (which Kim doesn’t really like to do).

Anyway, this environment has led to an extreme amount of stress in my life and I decided, after a few months of escalating nonsense, to look for other employment options.  This current position also requires me to do some intense physical work, and my health has been declining rapidly since I started working here.

I’m now pretty far along in the process of interviewing for a much higher paying position at the company I currently work for part time.  The only problem is, Kim just announced that she will be leaving her position, meaning I would leave my teammates (who I care about and don’t want to inconvenience) scrambling to cover for both me and Kim should I leave. 

I’m also planning on moving away from this city, and both of these jobs, in the next year. 

So, should I take this new, better job for a few months, or stick it out at this miserable one so as not to hurt my team?

A couple years ago I decided that I wanted to steer my career in a direction where I’d eventually be working for myself full time, and although I’m nowhere near close to that point yet, I’m really excited about this first fruit of my efforts.  A little background on me: graduated ten years ago, live in the Bay Area, and have worked at some of the more notable tech companies here in SV.  Due to the decent success I’ve had on the job front, I’ve always been the “go to” guy in my circle of friends and family members for resume help and general career advice, and I had never really thought much about this until I had the idea that I could turn it into a full\-blown career.  The idea stuck with me and one day, I just started writing and continued doing so pretty much every day since for the past couple years.  This week, I’m proud to say that my efforts have finally culminated in a real, tangible product that I think \(hope\) is ready for the world to see.

For this first book, I took everything I knew about how to write a great resume and condensed it down into a comprehensive, step\-by\-step guide that anyone can use to shape their resume in a way that will truly capture the attention of potential employers.  There’s a lot of advice out there\-\-some of it good, some of it bad\-\-and I wanted to put my own spin on what’s worked for me and the others who I’ve helped land their target jobs.  The end result is something I hope can truly help people avoid the mistakes that land their resumes in the dreaded black hole and get them one step closer to finding a meaningful, fulfilling career path.

I've always wondered why that would be such a risk.  One time when I was unemployed, I considered looking in other areas for jobs and applied for a few out of state.  I got calls back from the recruiters about them, but they'd say they were hesitant to hire someone from out of state or wouldn't pay for relocation (which was fine with me).  At the same time, sometimes I get contacted from recruiters about jobs all across the country..  It seems like some places are afraid to hire from out of state, and some aren't.

Also at that time, I was contacted by a hiring manager at a company within my state but in a different city, about 3-4 hours drive from where I was living.  At first I wasn't sure I'd want to move there, so I didn't respond, but he contacted me again a week later and I decided it wouldn't hurt to try.  I suppose the hiring manager liked what he saw on my resume to contact me again.  I made it through the phone interviews and in-person interview, and they hired me.  So I guess if a place likes you enough and you seem to fit in, you have a chance. ",2019-05-21 15:21:28
852,a9nmrn,False,None,36,Entry level jobs that teach valuable skills?,careerguidance,"I'm 22 and feel like I have no real skills that would help me get a decent job. Right now I'm an Aerospace Warehouse Support. For the most part I answer emails from branches and ship parts out to them or fulfill orders for customers. For example Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and a bunch of other places you've probably never heard of. I get paid $13 an hour (30 hours a week) and a little bonus every month if we meet certain goals. I want to start saving up for a house but I need something that pays more. Which I understand in order to get paid more I need a better job and those require skills.

So my question is what are some jobs a person without lots of experience or degree could get that teach valuable skills that could help me get a better job down the line? Also that pay better. (Excluding anything that has to do with sales, automobiles, and construction)

853,8x4cxi,False,None,16,How to find my path after 19 years at age 43?,careerguidance,"This is going to be a long read, and I apologize for it.  I've written this over 4 days and have tried to explain my situation as best as I can.  (It still seems to be a book, and I'm sorry about that.)

I graduated from college (BS, Economics) from a well-known mid-atlantic university in 1999. I was young, and I didn’t have a lot of direction. I wound up taking a job in Healthcare as an entry-level pharmacy technician, which was completely unrelated to my major. Initially, I had planned to stay there a year, two tops. By that time, I would figure out what I wanted to do and I’d start my destiny. But that’s not really how life works. I got very comfortable. I knew there was little to no upward mobility, but that was OK. The job was close to my home, my boss was friendly, the work was easy, and the hours were great. The pay wasn’t as high as I’d like, but for a recent college grad, living back at home, the money was just fine to both help my parents with bills and save some cash.

A few years after my hire date, I decided to continue working there while doing something I always wanted to do. I wanted to run my own company. I had/have solid IT skills. I was “that guy” that everyone went to in order to fix computer problems. Family, friends, and even at work I became the unofficial IT guy.  (With that added responsibility did come increased pay.)  I decided to monetize that, and I used my experience and knowledge to start an IT company. I went from 4 clients to over 1,100 (about 82&#37; of those repeats) and wound up running a very successful IT company for over a decade. I was young, I was able to work my 9-5, see clients till 9 or 10PM, work till 4AM in my basement repairing machines, and then get 3 hours of sleep to go back to my day job. I did this for about a decade, working most weekends from ages 24-35. Finally burning out, along with the industry changing, I closed the company when the disparity between income and expenses was getting too close. My wife and I also started our family, and raising kids and working 20 hours a day was not feasible for my own health or for being a parent.

I developed a good source of income from my computer company on-top of the “ok” income from the 9-5. I was able to start two 529’s. My children’s college will essentially be funded even if I never earn another dollar. I was also able to create a decent high five-figure nest egg which I have invested and don’t intent to touch.

19 years later, while I have moved up a little to Senior Lead Pharmacy Technician, the company has gone through several changes in ownership, and is now owned by a big company that you would definitely know.  I'm overpaid in the industry due to the length of time I've been there.  I’ve declined recent promotions because the local leadership is very poor, and the income increase for those positions is widely out of touch with the increase in responsibilities. Those positions would very likely kill me.  Very recently, many of my coworkers have resigned which has in some cases tripled the work the remaining people have to do which has presented not only unsafe situations for patients, but has induced a health-scare for me as a result of being overworked. My blood pressure skyrocketed the other day to unsafe levels, and it was completely work-induced. I don’t want to die at a desk in a job that I have come to hate.  I've come to the awakening that my departure is overdue.

I’m now 43 years old. I’m more or less in the same job I started in when I was 25. The roles have changed, the pay has increased, the responsibilities have increased. I need to find a new job, but I’m completely lost. I haven’t been on an interview in 19 years. I know how to write a resume, and I updated mine about 2 years ago in preparation for a move. I’m very well respected at my job, but they are suspicious as to why I don’t want the promotions. I am their lead performer in terms of branch metrics, as laid out by the company’s expectations. I simply no longer want to work under this atmosphere of the current leadership because it’s impacting my health. I’m at the point where I’m mentally OK with resigning before finding something else, but I know that is not a smart move. It is time for me to put my big guy pants on, and get out into the world and do something better to support my wife and kids.

**Here is my problem**: I don’t know what I can offer someone.  Not to get caught up in the buzzwords, but I’m reliable, dependable, honest, both public and private. I show up to work during snow storms of any amount, and I work really well with coworkers - I'm well respected by my peers, and I have become an ""unofficial leader"" among them.  I am a team player, and I’m not there to see only myself excel. I am good with computers, and I have 20 years of really solid customer service skills that I use to make even the most unhappy customer a happy one. A lot of that comes from working in healthcare; these people are sick and have little to no guidance other than me. More of that skill comes from when I ran my company. It was only me; I did sales, cold calls, marketing, advertising, on-site repairs, workshop repairs, customer service, billing, all of the financials, and when something went wrong, I had to be there to take the hit, accept responsibility and make the situation right for the customer.  I wore all of the hats.

Even with all of the above, I feel like I still don’t know what I can offer someone, and I have no idea what industry would be mutually beneficial based upon my skill set(s).

Can someone point me in the right direction? I know that this is a very general question, but even resources where I could go to find out where I might fit in would be helpful.   For my own health, I have to step out of acute healthcare. My IT skills have waned a little bit, and I’m definitely not up on the newest and greatest. I have no certifications, not even A+ back in the day. I just knew how to talk to people, I could fix things, and keep people happy. I could work the magic, and it worked out for everyone.

I just feel really lost, and it is my own fault. I’m just looking for help.  I'm not opposed to any industry, just not acute healthcare.  My heart (and body) are no longer in it.

I had my first quality assurance review yesterday and scored pretty well. My boss confided in me that she sees a lot of potential in me and compared me to someone who started where I did and now in a senior management position. She said that if my score is the same or better next time, she wants to know where I want to be in five years and help me get there.

Today is my last day . I’ve been with my current company for 6 years. 

Two years ago we got new managers that have been nightmares . They gossip about staff to other staff, don’t help at all, talk down to us, abuse their power and don’t know what they’re doing in general.

I got a new office job starting Monday and I used my original manager as my job reference .

At the end of my shift today I have an exit interview with HR and I’m not sure if I should just go quietly or if I should let them know that I am leaving because of the horrible new management (I’m the third person to quit just this month alone)

EDIT:
Another thing they did that irritates me ; after giving two weeks notice I used a sick day . When I went to enter it into the system my 5 sick days turned into 0. I went to HR and they said someone went into the system and deleted my sick days , HR fixed it for me. These are the kind of managers I’m dealing with so I am becoming less and less worried about burning bridges I have no desire to work in this field again 

UPDATE:

I had the meeting. It started off with some paper work and I decided I wasn’t going to say anything ... until they asked me. 

I let them know what the biggest issues were and how they could be improved. At the end of the day I don’t want to ever go back to that company/field and it’s not helping anyone if I stayed quiet.

858,bnojli,False,None,45,Evaluation interview after 3 months @ big 4 - should I tell them that I want to quit ?,careerguidance,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm fresh out of college (business law bachelor degree, top 10%) and 3 months into a big 4 company as a tax consultant and I have my first evalution interview in a few days. They are going to rate my performance and I'm supposed to give them feedback and where I see my future in the company.

&#x200B;

The thing is: I hate the job. Mostly because I discovered that I hate tax (even though I'm barely doing tax law, I'm a glorified accountant right now and I hate calculating and numbers). Partly because they lied to me at the job interview about home office and flexible working. They also won't train me because the company policy prohibits this (the seniors won't get a promotion if they train new colleagues - aka wasting time). They literally just dumped me alone in another room at the end of the building away from my colleagues the first 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a new job since 2 months but it's tough if you are fresh out of college and working full time. So I'm thinking if I should tell them that I want into another department on another location which focuses more on actual law (preferably not tax) and with less numbers to calculate. This is super risky because I'm still on probation so they could easily fire me. So I'm not sure if I'm better off just to continue looking for another job? But not sure if I can sit through this.

What should I do ?

I'm looking for suggestions on career direction. Can anyone help please?

* **Customer service/sales** \- Don't enjoy being at the front line. Worked in retail/fashion and events management, both of which I lost interest very quickly. Also worked at a healthcare clinic startup, where thankfully instead of directly selling treatments to patients, I briefly managed the sales team (interim till Sales Manager came on) and drafted the initial sales strategy (enjoy).
* **Graphic and product packaging designs** \- know the basics of Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign. Did some basic work - logos, website wireframes, print materials, photo editing, and product packaging designs for a small skincare line. Very therapeutic, but in the long run I don't have the patience to...well, echoing another redditor's comment, explain why this shade of colour is better than your grandma's choice.
* **Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable** \- I like looking at numbers once in a while. I was pretty good with Maths back in high school, though ended up pursuing a BA, so my maths is somewhat rusty. I also enjoy working with Excel, but majority of my roles only uses Excel on a beginner level - rarely requires the usage of Vlookup, pivot table, spreadsheet modelling etc.
* **Digital marketing** \- basic familiarity. Had a 3 month exposure to it a couple of years ago as an assistant. I've been reading up on how to get in, but not 100% sure I will like it. Partly because...wouldn't it be ironic to be in the field but doesn't use/have facebook, instagram etc? Further, when I had the opportunity to manage social media for a company, I wasn't motivated enough to make it happen.
* **Project management skills** \- currently pursuing a PMP certification. Based in a place where there's a very conservative, certificate-oriented hiring culture. Even if being certified in PMP isn't a requirement, I've been told that it provides some assurance for the employer (yes, I am aware that being certified doesn't translate to doing well at the job, but unfortunately many conservative employers here think certified = excel at the job)
* **Setting up/improving business processes/procedures** \- worked at a startup where process/procedures were either not in place or could be improved. What I did were relatively small-scale processes and procedures, but it was nice to be the one to set up or improve them. At another job, I also restructured the front desk operations.
* **Brand management** \- took an intro course, which I had fun with. So the concepts are there. But I don't have a huge amount of brand management experience. While I did help build the brand at the startup, my involvement was mostly in designs with some strategy planning.
* **HR -** familiar, as I was the unofficial HR assistant/manager in two of my previous roles. Not a path I want to pursue.
* **Business Strategy** \- Only had a small snippet of this in helping the startup refine the strategy and vision.

I also like researching and investigating things, and learn new softwares. I tried learning how to code, which is nice when I'm learning leisurely. But I would be terrified to code as a full-time job.

&#x200B;

I know a look of people like to bash for working at amazon, and it's true it's terrible to work at, but if you are the lucky few  your job their isn't to bad, and well it pays my bills, some days you don't feel like a slave. 

&#x200B;

Now that Christmas is over the work at amazon warehouses goes down, so they need to say bye to the temp hires they hired, and the Blue badges who are hired by amazon, need to get moved around. So about 3-4 months ago, they needed to move people from one side of the warehouse to the other, to balance workflow, basically what happened is the managers picked who they would class lazy workers and gave them a letter saying they are getting moved over, this was with no notice at all, and they were given the worst shifts possible, over the weekend, plus nights since whom i work with work at night, but during the weekdays, so of course everyone was unhappy and complained, so this time around HR, wanted to be more fair about it, they gave us more notice and a chance to volunteer to move over to the other side of the building, where we also get to pick three different shifts we would like most out of all the available shifts. they needed 60 people in total out of our side of the warehouse from every shift, the rule also was, if not enough people volunteered, they will pick the people who most recently got a Blue badged  (moved from agency and hired by amazon), and So if this was true, I would be on the list to get moved, so the smartest thing to do is to volunteer, and secure a Good shift and not get stuck with a bad one, So in the meeting we sit with our Senior Manager, before we wait for the last person to arrive, we just have general chats before he explains the process and asks if anyone wants to go, In this meeting the important thing i noted is when he said, They wouldn't force you to go from a Night Shift to a Day shift since you are used to your money you get weekly, its about £40 higher, it adds up, and since we all get over worked, no one would wanna get paid less. So with that it gave me more confidence that volunteering would be the best thing in my shoes to do, And I do, so the next week comes, I get my letter and I see that they put me on a Day shift but even worse Mid day, so you work from 12 to 12 at night, with the Day pay lol, now we all at amazon love to gossip and complain to each other, so i find out from my Manager that this Girl is leaving to the other side of the building and I'd be good for her job, she got to sit down xD so i was Like YESSS< but then i was like shit i volunteered to go too, he was like you weren't on the list to go, which just got me mad, since HR lied Senior management lied, They clearly got to pick again who could stay and go, they picked me since I'm not lazy, well I am but they don't catch me, and another point is, this other girl who Got her blue badge way way before anyone and should of been safe, got forced to go, and She got the shift I picked as my first Option, which makes the whole volunteer system bullshit and meaningless in the first place. so of course I go to explain to my manager and he tells me to write a letter, to someone i haven't herd of, or ever seen, in the building. i just want some advise on how I put a letter together, since clearly from this mess Im not much of a writer. 

&#x200B;

I know that if i send a letter to the write person in the building something could be done, for someone in my shoes its not much of a big deal, i can still get to work, the £40 less isn't a huge deal, but what if i didn't have a car, or access to work at that time, or really need the extra £40, people who were forced to move over again, are in those situations, maybe exposing their whole process of moving people was a shit show again, maybe they can do it fucking properly.

She was very accommodating and spoke to the manager on that... and asked about my situation which I only revealed ""it's a different type of position and I want to make a thorough decision... should hear back next week."" 

What I really need advice on is **how do I tell 1st choice that I need an answer before Friday?** We literally just spoke today. Should I email the recruiter ASAP or mention it at the interview on Tuesday? and how do I word this conversation / email?!

It's my first time posting and encountering this so I really appreciate all answers! If more detail is needed, happy to provide.

I accepted the job, I was told several times I was going to be a wfh employee from HR and have emails to show from HR saying this and docs they had me fill out for working at home and criteria for internet etc, that they canceled scheduled orientation date since I was remote.

The background check due to an error on their end took 2mths. Since knowing once background clears I will be remote job I decide to move in with fiance who works further away and this was the perfect chance with having the time before start. I set up new home office and picked out place with extra bedroom for office.

Boss now tells me this isn't the case. I addressed this clearly what I was told and how I was moving based on this info but I am being told that was a mistake and need to be in office everyday and can't even have one day - didn't matter what HR said.

I am stuck with a far commute that I didn't sign up for. I asked recruiter in interview what the hours are, he responded 9-5 now I am told 8-5. I wouldnt mind at all if was told upfront but now that I have a longer commute with a longer work day. I've had long commutes in past and really worked hard to avoid this by asking questions.

868,gqq54z,False,Advice,24,How do you distinguish between a dream and a career that suits you?,careerguidance,"Throw away account.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for replying! I'm using Reddit minimally so I will get back to all of you soon.

I'm 30 year-old male and my career background is teaching English as a second language. I dropped everything and ""learned to code"" two years ago and am calling it quits to go back and teach English in Korea again. My fiancée is there and we thought if we broke into the tech industry it would be the best option for us. We each took bootcamps in our respective countries. She got a job as a web publisher! Unfortunately for me, I couldn't find *any* decent job in America with my previous work experience (barista, ESL teacher, events coordinator, and psych BA) or even by having attended a coding bootcamp. So she won't be immigrating here because we essentially wouldn't be able to live on my shitty salary. My relatives think I'm too impulsive and scattered with my ideas, but I think it's better to know when to quit. This endeavor has drained me and I don't even *like* what I started.

I still want a Masters Degree so my inability to find a job doesn't perpetuate, just not in computer science. Everything I think I want to be seems suspiciously idealistic, like I'm starry-eyed as I was for coding. I can't imagine who I want to be, but I want to be something. I took a career aptitude test and it had some very *cool* recommendations (diplomate, lawyer, judge, archeologist) but I can't see myself doing any of that.

Do people in those professions intuitively know that's the career they want in a sudden moment, a calling when when they hear the word, or do they stumble into it after lots of rumination?

Obviously, you can't just stumble into a law firm, but I feel like if I don't have a riveting call, a real competitive want *now*, then it's something I shouldn't start. But also, how would I know if I've never tried? The world is just so competitive that any direction I take will be challenging, that doesn't phase me, I just want to make sure I love it. In the meantime I'm grasping at straws like finding out I'm an ENFJ and taking aptitude tests.

I've always wanted to work for an organization like Amnesty International. What draws me to a position within AI is dealing with multiple diverse cultures and social justice. In my adolescence I wanted to be a preacher but I left the religion finding out I am an agnostic pantheist & atheist. When I was young, I dreamed of being outspoken like Tupac because of the positive changes he wanted to implement. Most recently, seeing Bernie Sanders run for office was inspiring, and I looked at running for a local district seat but am holding off because I want more professional experience and need to establish myself. In short, In my future career I need to somehow be benefiting people.

It's wildly frustrating because my family thinks me being stuck is because of my lack of religion. My mother is the only person who isn't pushing me to continue to code because she knows it's not something she'd see me doing in the first place.

How do I narrow down my career choices? How do distinguish between my dreams and actual talent? Or at least, how do I know I'll love something enough to keep pursuing it? I also feel absolutely spoiled because I'm 30 and have no real responsibility. Both of my grandparents were successful entrepreneurs and here I am living with mommy and daddy struggling to decide what *I* *want*. I feel like I have no right to complain, but by having privilege is more the reason I should find something that's great for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gqq54z/how_do_you_distinguish_between_a_dream_and_a/,66,"I relate so much to this and I am an ENFJ too.

&#x200B;

I'm a recent college graduate (May 2018) and 24 M, still figuring out my life. Per my other posts in different subs, I've been depressed at work. For the past few weeks, I've been royally dropping the ball at my current hotel night audit position, but it's mostly been a result of my bad attitude and mental state. I've moved from the east coast to out west for this job, and the night audit schedule/1 hour (6 nights weekly, 11-7:30) commute has also broken me down. Basically my negative attitude has been self-sabotaging to the point where I don't  learn or retain new information, and I've consistently failed to comply with proper practices, which should have gotten me fired by now but thankfully, I haven't been written up or fired. Aside from that, I have had communication issues, have not been diligent in my work, and have made accounting mistakes that should have gotten me fired, but most of all, I felt unhappy and unsatisfied with everything. I took all of my mistakes to heart, but didn't effectively solve them. It's all self-sabotage, and I feel like I'm beginning the arc into a successful adulthood! My mistakes have been documented and I don't think that I can get a job with this (major) hotel chain anymore, or at least for awhile, but I'm also happy that my boss has called me out on my BS and it has prompted me to really change my life for the better. My questions:

&#x200B;

How can I explain all of that to a new employer without sounding like an incompetent? I'm already applying for new jobs and about to give my 2 week notice for this hotel since I cannot work at nights anymore for my sanity and mental health. 

How can I promote myself effectively? I just realized all of these destructive behaviors in the last 2 weeks, so it's been a tremendous time for me personally. I haven't solved them all yet, but I'm on the path now and don't want to stop. 

Have any of y'all been in the same situation? What did you guys do to solve it?

To try to articulate what I don’t like in my job:
- I love working on teams, closely with people. The culture of my group doesn’t facilitate this, we work very isolated from each other.
- I don’t care about the final products I work on. I always envisioned myself “making a difference in the world”, and it’s hard to see how that’s true in CPG.
- I don’t feel challenged like I did in undergrad, much of my work is paper pushing or hunting down other people to make sure their work is getting done.

- He chronically steals company time. He disappears for 2-4 hours a day every day. Does not let us know where he’s been and is unreachable during these times. He does not log these hours as time off (part of my job is to track this for all employees).

- He will take vacation days or work remotely last minute, letting us know the morning of. 

- Is chronically unavailable and hard to find in the office - causes our work/projects to grind to halt without any supervision.

- I cannot speak to his personal life, but he has drank heavily at at least two company events and driven drunk. On one such occasion when he was drunk, he offered me a ride home. I declined.

- I recently got diagnosed with a serious medical issue that caused chronic migraines. My manager took me aside and criticized me for not working fast enough despite knowing full well of my condition. Essentially sent the message that if I can’t work fast enough, I should just take a sick day.

- Everyone on our team did not provide critical feedback of him during his annual review for fear of reprisals. He is the type to hold a grudge. 

My other coworkers are more junior (first jobs out of college) and fear they will lose their jobs if they report him. I’m in a more senior role, and very upset at his management style and his hurtful reaction to and handling of my unexpected medical condition.

Should I report him to HR upper management? I fear for my job as well, since we are a small team I imagine he’ll figure out who actually reported him.

I could not afford waiting for my dream job. Add up to that two career changes until I finally graduated. Now, I am in some sort of limbo where I was not even sure what I wanted to do. So I started trying many things which further dispersed my goals and makes me seem like someone who does not know what he wants. Moved to another country and took the first job I landed. Totally unrelated with my career. Also, I have a very cold personality so I am not very charismatic. I spent a lot of time trying to fix my social behaviours. Trying to be a lot more conversational than I feel comfortable and many other things. Bottom line is I keep getting rejected from HR jobs which is my major and I hold about 3 years of experience in the hr team of large multinationals. Last one ended about three 4 ago.

Finally, I am unemployed again and I decided something different. I cannot enroll in a masters degree rn, money is an issue. I seeked professional help and assessed my personality and I finally decided to accept those traits that people do not often like to admit. For example, I am not a multitasker, I am more logical than emotional, I am an excellent team player, however I kinda hate interacting too much with people. I'm shit at small talk.

What I am doing now is the following. I am studying data analytics on my own by taking online courses that I can afford. I focussed my CV on those skills that I actually feel comfortable admitting to. We are sold the idea sometimes that everyone has to be charismatic and all that stuff, but I am ready to stop trying to be someone I am not and play with my strengths. I am switching the focus of my career from HR to other departments like admin, accountings, finance, which are areas I am really good at grasping and fast.

The promotion is easy. New title more responsibility. Cool.

The raise though feels like a pay cut. So last year my yearly salary was raised to $55k in June, which makes some of the math complicated. Apparently I was to make $52000 for the year, Counting the mid year raise. 

However, I had a family emergency and needed to take some unpaid leave, so I went down to 30 hours a week for a few months. I ended up making $50k in total at the end of the year (counting unpaid leave).

Fast forward to today. I get my promotion and a “raise” to $53500 a year. Apparently the got my 2018 salary from HR and gave me a 5% raise off of what I make last year. So my full time 2019 salary was counted off my reduced unpaid family leave salary of 2018. 

This makes no sense. Is this how raises work? All things equal I think the raise should have been based on my FTE salary, not the FMLA one? Because working full time this year I’m making less than last year? That and now I have a lot more responsibility. How to I talk to my company about this?

891,aowmj0,False,None,46,Which Career is Less Stressful: Accounting or Programming?,careerguidance,"I've been deciding between Accounting and Programming. I just want to make sure I make the right choice based on my personality type. I'm a high anxiety person so its important that I choose a career I can handle well.

I've done some very basic skimming of both fields on the internet just to get a taste of what it's like. I don't know Jack, so I could be completely wrong about what I'm about to say below

Accounting looks good to me because it appears to have a stable workflow. It seems like kind of job that you can just sit down and get to right away. And it seems like a job that is more mechanical and streamlined (less mentally taxing and less likely to make your head blow up). A job that you can digest easily in small incremental portions. 

Programming looks interesting but I heard its for those problem-solver type people. The kind who like puzzles and brain games. That's not me at all. I never had an interest in puzzles as a kid and I still don't. It also seems like the kind of job where you frequently run into problems and lose your head over it. So that's a negative side for me. 

On the other hand, the idea of creating something from scratch (a program) is fascinating to me. I am a creative person at heart. Just not sure if I'll enjoy the act of programming because I never really did it personally so I don't know what it's like.

Which of these careers is less stressful? And which of them has a more flexible working schedule? I'm considering private accounting btw (which I hear is less stressful than public accounting)

A flexible work schedule is important to me. I've heard that a lot of programmers work on their laptops and choose to work whenever and wherever as long as they finish the work by the deadline. Is this true?

In my teenage years I took vocational and career classes.  I started  college but had to work instead.  I have worked my way up the past 23  years as a draftsman, a cad modeller, a tool maker, a designer and now  an engineering manager for the aerospace industry.  Most of what I do  now is Solidworks design.  I have experience in mechanical, electrical,  hydraulics, pneumatic systems and many various software systems.  I  design turn-key packages that include all of these elements.

I also do  some light programming in PLC, VBA and have previous experience with  HTML, PHP, Pearl, SQL.  I love computers and tech.  Building and repairing  PC's has been a hobby since I had a Tandy 6mhz.   I also build stuff.  Book  cases, picnic tables, bathrooms, kitchens, full size decks... doesn't  matta.  I can calc some hydraulic forces for you and spec cylinders and fittings, or drop you a new stainless dual tub with sprayer and disposal in a few hours.  
 

I can obviously tell that times have changed.  
 

Upset about the election results, my own employer has started a crusade  against ""uneducated"" people.   He also changed my title to strike the  word ""Engineering"" from it and replace it with ""Design"" as that doesn't  imply ""Fake engineer"".  It does not seem to matter that I have designed  millions of dollars of product for him, having completed close to a  thousand designs over the last 20 years.   I am still paid very well  regardless.  As acting Design Manager I do manage actual engineers with  actual degrees (is this all sounding crazy?) and I TEACH them our  industry.  
 

Anyhow.  It appears I need some papers to support the idea that I'm not  stupid.   The worst part of it is when I tell anyone how I make a  living, the very first comment is ""Where did you go to school?"" and I  sheepishly have to explain that I'm technically uneducated.  
 

I'm also concerned that if I needed a new job in the next 20 years I may  not be hired because I do not have a degree.  I have a stunning amount  in 401K, investments as a safety net.  I currently have 2 houses, one of  which I rent, and 4 income streams.  Therefore I feel that I do not  need the king of degrees, I just need groundwork to be considered by  companies.  I feel by 2030 no one will be allowed to WORK without a  degree, as even being a secretary now requires a degree >.<  
 

I am not sure if I want a degree in mech or aerospace.  With the second  half of my life, I may want to focus more on computer systems, or  perhaps focus on management.  But I need a direction to get started.   I  was also looking at the online schooling, as I work 10 hour days and  have a family.  If I could start with an associates that could later be  used toward various bachelors that would be very helpful.  I really do  not know a lot about the education process itself.  
 

I was also thinking I could add certs and licenses too, in various trade  skills.  I could also get a cert for Solidworks Certified Professional  and whatnot pretty easily, but never thought that would actually ""mean""  something on a resume.

It's kind of confusing because I have been working in the same position but serving 2 of their sister companies as well. My boss told me that the companies split my salary.
About a year ago - my paycheck source changed. Over the course of 3 years, the name of the parent company paying me has changed 3 times.
And a few months ago, one of those companies (that I helped get on the INC 5000)list laid everyone off. The CEO of that company did it from his private jet on his way to a luxurious vacation and posted about it on Facebook. No one was happy.
My CEO has always been pretty fair imo. But, it's been very strange trying to understand all the moving parts.
Last Friday he told me that I am moving exclusively to the OTHER company and I will most likely be required to travel 2weeks of every month. TWO WEEKS.
I am a mom and I honestly don't know how I'm going to do this. I make 6 figures and this is very, very important income. But, I am very concerned.
4 hours after this happened....at 10pm on Friday night -- my NEW CEO emailed and asked for changes to be made to an existing project I completed months ago. He wanted it ASAP. I couldn't get in touch with the editor, so I told him I would do my best.

So he does weird things.... and he doesn't even respond to me.

Boss told me it's an HR issue, he can do what he can but in the end it comes to their decision and they have a bad history with not crediting their own institution's degrees as a valid reason for pay increase.

&#x200B;

I want to continue for the PhD but I found out one of the employees we just hired with not much more than a Masters is making significantly more than me. To make it worse he's working under me as I've started to work point on most of the work I'm involved in. I'm at least another two years from finishing my PhD but given the fact I'm making close to 3x less my current market value I'm finding it hard to stay versus finding a new place and juggling a more demanding workplace with remaining schoolwork/research.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just at a loss for what I should do. I want to talk to HR or someone involved in the process but I don't even know where to begin.

Several times throughout my career, I was on the path to licensure and invariably, my job responsibilities would change (eg: management) and the offer to support it would be forgotten (and unnecessary for the new responsibilities). 

Recently, my position of a year as a therapist became team leader and came again with the promise of having someone at my workplace (who was qualified) supervise me so that I accumulate the hours for licensure. Again, it fell through and I’m not willing or interested in licensure. In my field, it means little in terms of money and a significant amount of additional work. I’ve tried to get out of this field for years but have resigned myself to sitting right where I am, with flexibility, freedom and time to work on side jobs (eg: freelance writing). I Meade $39k a year and was already told that with licensure, they would increase that $500. No thanks.

Sorry this is long. Anyway, my supervisor is now dangling another carrot, telling me that they intend to make me a manager in the near future. I guess if I were at the beginning of my career it might be enticing but I can’t think of anything I’d rather do less. I’m a great worker, fantastic documentarian, supportive and encouraging of my staff and willing to work above and beyond 40 hours every week (I’m salaried, so it’s irrelevant).

So I’m trying to figure out how much I should actually be getting paid. Surprise. I’ve been in my field nearly ten years and have had “superior performance” at every job — except probably my current one, but that’s a different story. 

Context: I’ve been interviewing with a few new companies and have gotten mixed reviews on salary range. I told one company (role reporting to CEO) my minimum was $60k and they said that was too much. For another job (reporting to VP), I told them $60k and the recruiter told me “I’m putting down $70k-$75k — that’s what you should be asking for.” They’re both in similar industries — the second one is arguably less responsibility, so what gives?

I’m interviewing with a third company that I really, really like so far, but salary hasn’t come up yet. This is another reporting to CEO job, same industry (SaaS dev). The recruiter already spilled the beans that she thinks I’m perfect, so I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the next round. 

The problem: I have no clue what to ask for in terms of salary! The last two interviews have totally thrown me for a loop with their $20k difference. Doing salary research, it seems every single salary site puts me in the $55k-$60k range, but salary.com puts me at $80k-$88k. 

Which do I trust? Do I risk losing a possibly amazing opportunity (if offered) because I asked for too much? Or do I undersell myself and hope for another crazy recruiter to tell me “oh no, here’s an extra $15k”?

My location has had a surge in tech which has been increasing some salaries — I’ve seen recs for engineers offering Bay Area salaries.

Well, I've grown professionally a lot since then and thought I'd start looking around for an opportunity that might pay more. I got 3 offers, all in the +10% range, and chose one of them that I liked.

Well, when I told my current company that I'd be moving on, they wanted to know how much the new place was offering, and what it'd take for me to stay. I gave them a number that seemed astronomical to me, and I thought they'd never accept. Well, they did. Today they offered me an annual salary just shy of twice my current, a position as lead engineer, and a relocation package to move to the company headquarters. Basically my dream job.

**The problem:** When they initially asked me how much the other place's offer was, I gave them a number a bit higher than it actually was. I don't know why, but it was really stupid. I guess I said that out of spite since I felt they had been underpaying me. The manager that talked with me about this (upper management actually, not my regular manager) requested a copy of that offer letter as part of whatever processing they do to get me into the new position. I said I'd get it to him....

What should I do??? I'm someone who values honesty, and this just makes me feel really really bad. If I confess, it makes me look stupid and dishonest. I have no logical reason to not send it over.

* *Network.* I know it doesn't always sound like the most fun, but networking gives you an excuse to dress up and get out of the house. There's an added bonus potential of meeting someone who could connect you with your next job opportunity.
* *Celebrate all of your successes.* If you landed an interview but didn't ultimately get the job, that still means your materials were awesome enough to get you an interview. Likewise, if you set a goal to send out 10 applications per week, and you reach your goal, celebrate! Remembering to take pride in the small victories can help keep you moving.

929,dav2my,False,None,39,"Received one job offer but have another interview after the deadline, what should I do?",careerguidance,"Job offer dilemma - any advice is appreciated!

So, good news - I received an amazing job offer from the company I interned for this summer (great pay, benefits, plus a foot in the door in the oil & gas industry, a field that I could see myself working in long-term), and the deadline to accept is October 4th. About a week and a half ago, I received a final round interview for another company, where they will be flying me out to OKC for three days for the interview starting October 16th. (I'm a senior ME student by the way).

Company 1: 

1) Had an amazing summer internship experience, really liked the work I did and the company culture.

2) Rotational Program - Living in 3 different cities for 3 years to experience different aspects of the company, really like this idea. Plus I could start my 1st rotation in the city I went to college in, which is appealing.

Company 2:

1) Comparable work to Company #1 (field engineering - lots of travel, etc.. which I like), but less work-life balance (24 hr on call, working on a rig, work holidays, etc..), and also has a sort of rotational program.

2) Starting pay seems to be a little more, than Company #1 (from what I've been able to find online).

3) Potential for international work - This is a big one, I've always wanted to work/live internationally for at least a few years, Company #1 is US only.

I thought about calling Company #1 to ask for an extension so I could explore all possible opportunities, but the same situation happened last summer, and it was denied, so the odds of getting an extension this time are low.  As this is my first full-time job out of school, I really wanted to be able to cover all possibilities so I could make the best decision for myself. What I've been thinking was to accept Company #1's offer, and still go on Company #2's interview - and if Company #2 ends up giving me a better or more attractive offer, to rescind my acceptance.

Does this course of action seem reasonable? I've had some friends do something like this in the past and it seems a bit shady when I think about it, but let me know your thoughts!

Thanks!

My current job:

I’m 23 (will be 24 when I graduate) and I’ve worked at a small local business that curates and sells business casual higher end clothes for 5 years now.

My official job title is “Director of Sales” and I have that title on my company business cards/emails/etc. This is obviously a rather inflated title, however I thought that with my last raise I would get a title that would look better on a job resume in the future. Last spring I was invited by the owners to attended an award ceremony with them because we were voted the best clothing store in the area (even beating places like Nordstrom!).


As for my duties consist of the following: 

-   assist with customers (all sales duties, it’s a small shop)

-   research new brands for the store to begin carrying

-   fully process new shipments (sign for, create, add photos, decide MSRP, etc.) 

-   write up descriptions for individual inventory item / website brand landing pages 

-   add new items to our online store 

-   create displays for in store advertising 

-   and social media advertising  

-   occasionally email customers and suppliers who with inquiries about products or orders

-   on my off days I will work online researching brands, or visiting other local clothing stores to check out their inventory in person- taking notes on brands that could fit well in our store.

A CEO of a very big and well-known company in our industry somehow got wind of me leaving my company and looking for a job (not sure how since only a few people know right now), and called me to ask for a meeting. I met with him and he offered me a very high-paying job running one of his company's departments. I was taken aback my this offer. It is very lucrative and a position most people would kill for. However, I personally believe I am not qualified. I know this CEO from my previous job, where we would interact constantly, so he knows my experience for the most part, which is why it is surprising that he offered this position to me.

I am not sure what to do. I feel like even though I am under-qualified, I can read and study and learn what I need to, and in a few months be somewhat qualified. They also said they will train me. I did want a challenging job and this job will definitely be tough.

My friends and family think I would be stupid to not take the job, and the worst-case scenario would be I get fired but would still learn a lot during my time there even if that happens. They also think I AM qualified and just have low self-confidence, which I admit has always been a personal issue for me.

I was thinking of requesting another meeting and being honest to the CEO with my skills and what he expects, just so there are no surprises, would that be the best way to go about this?

Another complication is that if I take this position, I will technically be competing against the company I started, so that makes things even weirder for me.

How can I make the leap to a proper career path after so many squandered years?",careerguidance,"(I originally posted this over in r/personalfinance before a redditor directed me over to this sub, which really seems to be a better fit for the problem I have. Over there, I got a lot of advice to the effect of going to a trade school or looking into things like technical writing or going back into transcription. This is all good advice, and I have been Googling up a storm researching these possibilities. But I am always willing to listen to people who have a better idea of how to handle this situation. Please, bury me in your tips and observations.)

My resume consists of food service for the most part, though I did spend nearly three years working both back and front of house in a brewery. I've also had stints as a package handler at UPS, some transcription work and a glorified cart mule at Home Depot and Wal-Mart as my first two jobs when I was around 19.
I have usually been employed since the age of 19, though there was a long slog in 2016 where I was unemployed. Thankfully, I got over that hump, and I have been working for Chipotle since September of 2016. It pays $9.00 an hour, which is enough for me to live on in a dirt cheap college town even at less than full-time hours, but I'm really just treading water. I'm not working toward anything, and I don't see any future here.

I am moving away very soon even if it means moving back in with my parents in Atlanta. I let myself get caught in a rut, living only for the weekend and grading my life on how many parties I had been to in the past month. I don't drink or smoke or do any drugs. I have no arrests or any kids or ex-spouses complicating my life, but I've still spent most of my 20s living like the dumb college kid I should have outgrown.

I am closer to 30 than 20 these days, and it has dawned on me that I locked myself out of a lot of opportunities by settling for less and just getting by. Most of my peers are out-earning me several times over with jobs and degrees in IT, medicine, accounting or the sciences. I, on the other hand, have a print journalism degree I'm not using after I realized that for all that I love the written word, I don't really like the nature of journalism all that much. The pay and hours were terrible, I felt like scum for leeching on tragedies, etc. So that's the long and short of it. My life has been fun but unproductive.

945,hf4i4g,False,None,28,"Boss doesn't like my face. Literally. Should I ride it out assuming she can't do much more than be annoying about it, confront it, or start submitting resumes elsewhere and hope being ugly isn't such a universal drawback?",careerguidance," 

Female, in case it matters, which I suspect it does, sadly. I'm fairly ugly. I'm not severely physically deformed or such, but I'm just plain old ugly; huge round droopy nose, sunken in eyes a little too close together, Dwayne's syndrome so one of my eyes doesn't turn outward all the way which leads to a head tilt to compensate, almost no distinction between my chin and my neck, Rosacea means I always look as red as if it'd just run a marathon at all times, gangly and bony. I've worked in programming all of my adult life and generally haven't had to interact with people face to face which helps. On the phone, I have good rapport with end users; fortunately my voice isn't too bad. About a year ago I got transferred to a new office in a new position under a new boss due to some company mergers and such.

I was recently passed up for a promotion in favor of a coworker I trained, whom I was still training at the time of the interview, who has become my supervisor. The two of us were the only ones who applied. She's wholly competent and also has former supervisory experience in another field whereas I have only ever done programming. I'm not displeased with her as a supervisor, nor do I think she is undeserving, even though I'd obviously have preferred the position myself. But I asked what I did wrong in the interview and my boss said it was a fine interview but that I lacked certain soft skills, and lamented it was her fault for never giving me training on expected manners and hygiene.

I shower daily, I use deodorant, I brush twice a day and usually do a mouthwash rinse at lunch so I can't imagine I smell too bad. I wear typical khakis and collared unpatterned shirts, so I'm certain I'm dressed appropriately even if not femininely or stylishly. I've had several performance reviews, none of which have ever had any criticisms whatsoever. Three in a row of just ""keep doing what you're doing."" I've requested and gotten pay raises from past supervisors as I've made contributions and the like.

I interviewed for a promotion (same job, different title = more pay situation) and got it. I've interviewed for this two times prior and hadn't gotten it, and this was the first time my boss was not on the interview panel, but my (new) supervisor was. Last interview for it was a month prior, so no major changes in my qualifications or achievements. A part of me suspected this was not a coincidence that my boss was not on the deciding panel for the first time when I got it, but I get my pay raise, so I'm happy.

Due to COVID-19, we have limited staff in the physical office. I go in twice a week to handle database matters which can't be done remotely due to requiring a direct network connection rather than VPN. My supervisor is also there on one of those days. She had said yesterday that our boss demanded my ID badge photo be changed, because mine was ""unacceptable."" The badge photos are generally taken by a staff member whose entire job is to assure it's an acceptable photo. It's been acceptable this long. It's about two years old, but I've never heard of anyone getting a new picture; there are people in the office who are 60+ who have their ID badge with a photo from when they were hired in their 30s.

The HR processing team is not physically in the office, so my supervisor has to take the photo with her phone. We do that first thing in the morning and get back to work. She comes over a few hours later and says the boss didn't like it, that I must smile ""better."" My mouth is uneven and my teeth are crooked. My entire face is off center. I repeat, I'm not a pretty girl. Trying to force an even smile looks very awkward and more like a cringe than a smile. Sure enough, this one is shot down, too. The boss tells my supervisor I must wear my hair a certain way in the picture (my standard hair style is just straight down flat, nothing special or weird). We have to reshoot three times, each time my supervisor thinking it looks fine, before the boss will accept a picture.

All I can assume is that my boss just doesn't like my face. Are there any other suggestions for me besides ""try to look better"" ?

I'm okay with being ugly, but if I take particular pains to try to look pretty it becomes depressing because it's impossible, or because it would be great effort, money and discomfort just trying to look normal rather than ugly. In an age where everybody has self esteem issues and depression and anxiety, I'm quite mentally hardy, I'm physically fit, I do triathlons as a hobby, I'm successful in a career that requires a certain degree of intelligence, I volunteer at an animal shelter and feel a general sense of connection to my community and purpose and all that; I like myself when I don't have to try too hard to be something I'm not: pretty.

Getting into nursing school is now more competitive than ever, and with the exception of some geographic areas, it’s no longer as easy to land a job in nursing (unless of course, you have 5+ years of experience).

Now, when I started I was not in much of a position to negotiate and was quite flatly told there was no budget to go higher on it. At this point I had a MSc but only a couple of internships to my name, my colleague had an MSc and one year of work experience in a similar company. So to an extent I understand why she would be earning more than me, although I do think the increase is somewhat shocking given she didn't negotiate her deal. After a year, I was given a 3% increase. I am trying to figure out what to do in this situation, as I feel I am not being fairly compensated for my work. I have been there two years now and am the longest serving member of the team (aside from my boss) by almost 2 years...

I'm in my 4th year of doing software implementations and I hate it. I've worked for 3 different companies so far, switching because I always thought that I hated my job because of the companies that I worked for, but I've recently come to the conclusion that it's not the company, but more the actual type of work/industry that I just don't jive well with. I hate it because -

1. I'm overworked. I know this is a problem for a lot of people, but I really value work/life balance and I always end up working \~60 hours a week because there is just so much work to do all the time. I'm always overwhelmed. 
2. I don't care. I'm not passionate about implementing software solutions for large companies to help them save money on software purchases in the long run. When things get hard it's difficult to convince myself it's worth it because what I do doesn't matter to me. 
3.  It doesn't feel real. Working virtually via monitors and phones means the work that I'm doing doesn't feel tangible. I'm not out in the real world providing value in a physical way, which is discouraging. I'm working from home (which is kind of nice) and rarely ever seeing people in real life and all of the solutions I build are on customer servers that I never see the benefits from after I'm done with the project.
4. I constantly get shit on. Software is complicated and things break and/or need to be customized all the time. Clients hate this and even when it's not my fault at all I'm always the guy to get blamed first. This is taxing on me and drives my stress levels through the roof, which I truly believe is causing some real problems with my physical and mental health at this point. I'm constantly under a lot of pressure and project managers are constantly all over me to get work done faster, even when it's unrealistic. 

I chose this career path mainly because there is so much opportunity in the field and it's pretty lucrative (I make around $90k right now). Now I'm realizing that even if I was paid 50% more I still wouldn't want to do this anymore. It's time to figure out what to do next, but that's where things get complicated. I'm interested in a lot of fields, but of course each field has it's own issues and I'm trying to figure out what would work well for me. Some of the topics I'm interested in include -

1. Aviation. I've wanted to be a pilot since I was a kid and tried to go to flight school when I was 19, but I failed the medical exam for an issue that I've been dealing with since then so I might not be able to pass the exam now either (chronic kidney stones)
2. Construction. I've helped build 2 houses before over the course of 2 years and I really enjoyed it. I don't want to do anything too back breaking as I get older though. I would really like to flip houses or be a construction manager or something someday, just not sure how to do either of these without a lot of capital or experience at this point. 
3. Small business ownership. My dad owns a small business and it's worked out really well for him. I've always been interested in entrepreneurship, but taking the leap has always seemed too risky for me because I have student loan and medical debt, and also I'm not sure what kind of business to start (especially without any real startup capital). 

A couple of other important factors to consider in my decision making process here are the facts that my girlfriend, who I plan to marry, is a 3rd year medical student so we will likely be moving in a little under two years for her residency. Also I have 2 bachelor's degrees in business (Information Systems and International Business) which I still have about $20k of debt for. I also love travelling and being outdoors a whole lot. I like helping people and animals and hate corporate america with all of it's politics, bureaucracy, conference calls etc. I'm also a pretty good people person, even though what I do now is very technical I'm better at the business side of my job than I am at the technical side. 

Again I'm sorry for the novel of a post, I'm just really down in the dumps and trying to figure out what change to make in my life and I really feel like I need some 3rd party perspective on what might be a good direction to head in.

If people 'shit' on your for things that aren't your fault regularly, again this is some you can strongly influence. If it happened once that is different. If it happens regularly you have trained them to know you will take it.  Instead consider this. Next time a person starts to 'shit' on you for something that isn't in your control, say, ""I understand you are frustrated. But speaking to me in an accusatory tone about something outside of my control isn't OK. I'm going to step out for a few minutes to let things (you and them) cool off.  When I come back, I'll be ready to listen to solutions that involve me if that is helpful. See you in a few minutes."" Then leave for at least 5 min. Leave the building and take a walk.

955,dr7nge,False,None,18,Should I pursue a second Bachelor's degree or apply to a Master's program so I can gain more experience on my resume?,careerguidance," Hi everyone! I've posted this in a couple other grad school related subs and I felt it would be relevant here.

This is my first post in this sub and as my title suggests, I'm questioning on whether to go and pursue a second Bachelor's degree or continue on to a Master's Program.

I recently graduated with a B.B.A in Economics back in May and after several months of applying to entry level Data Analyst positions and internships, I haven't been receiving any feedback at all from recruiters.

I think my lack of experience in the field is a major turn-off for employers, as I never completed any internships or had any relevant work experience while I was in school. I only took an introductory Econometrics course, but we never were exposed to any of the programs/languages that employers are looking for now. We only used the Data Analysis Toolpak in Microsoft Excel, and only analyzed Simple and Multiple-Linear Regressions from the ANOVA outputs.

This was in addition to analyzing larger data sets in SAP Predictive Analytics, but we were never exposed to R, SQL, SAS, Tableau, or similar programs.

I've always thought about going back to grad school at some point, but if I'm able to get an entry level position as a Data Analyst without a Master's degree, it wouldn't be worth the hassle to enter a Master's degree program. I would only consider grad school if it meant employers taking my resume more seriously.

As far as research interests, I never really thought that far ahead, but if I'm in a program I love, I wouldn't mind compiling/analyzing a data set for a thesis paper. If I were to enter a graduate program, I would probably pursue one where I would have hands-on experience working with R, SQL, Tableau, or similar software.

However, I feel like my only option at this point would be to go back to school, receive a second's Bachelor's degree and complete an internship, as my final undergraduate GPA was a 2.42. I will admit that early on, I was not a serious student and did not take my coursework seriously. It wasn't until my senior year of college that I started to turn my GPA around and took school seriously. In addition, I do not have a strong math/calculus background so I think it would be a hard sell for an admissions committee to consider my application.

As of today, I have not taken the GRE or GMAT exams, but I would be willing to take them if there was a remote possibly that it would help improve my chances of applying somewhere.

Please let me know what your opinions are on my situation, as I really want to start a career where I actually am excited to get out of bed and go to work in the morning.

Went to community college to basically do all the the general education stuff. I started taking medss and realized that I'm not an idiot....I honestly thought I was stupid. I figured out what I wanted to study, and made plans to study it. I chose industrial (product) design because it was a good marriage of my love for sketching, design, and keen sense of aesthetics with my problem solving abilities. I tried going to the local state college nearby that had that major, but it was really small and I didnt get in. I wanted to avoid a fine Arts college, because i didnt want to deal with being taught theory. I wanted to to go to a super awesome ($$$) school....but would have to spend time teaching myseld things to build a portfolio, likely be rejected, and then try multiple times. I was 23 at the time and felt like I had to go to school and had to go then, or else I never would. So, i chose a college out of state where I had a community of close friends, but also really dug the energy and creativity in the area. 

 I worked hard. I learned a lot. I set standards and a lot of my peers and mentor respected me. Towards the end, things got a little out of control in my personal life; I ended up moving home shortly after graduating. I knew the job market for me here (home) was going to be rough.....not a lot of options.....but I had no other choice.  After the first year, I gave up trying to relocate. Given my lack of experience, I wasnt even considered for non local positions. I applied and applied and applied to literally everything I saw that was remotely related to what I know how to do and that would also be good for my long-term career plans. 

The problem I found was because my background is in design, companies looking for entry level CAD or 3d Modeling people were more focused on engineering backgrounds, despite the fact that a good portion of my education involved mechanical engineering and technical designing. Given, it is something Id need to learn more about hands on, these are still entry level positions and I would not be in over my head.
 So, I sat around at my parentss house unemployed (an odd end job here or there) avoiding applying to work at large retailers. I eventually caved and have now been at one almost a year.

The problem:

I recently just had an interview (for the first time in months) thats so entry level its just cleaning machines.....but definitely in the realm of what im interested in doing. But, yet again, I hear nothing/rejected. I dont know exactly what it is Im doing so wrong. I'm smart; a fast and competent worker. I get stuff done fast, correctly, and notice the things everyone else misses. I would rock literally any job that doesnt involve customer service.....which isnt anything im applying for. I'm an organaizational mastermind and can compartmentalize tasks for efficiency like a motherf****r. I have communication problems and tend to not understand fully the impact of my statements, body language, or facial expressions. People often ask me if im okay when im thinking or dilligently looking for something. Theres a running joke in my closest circle of friends and family that im on the spectrum (autism).  The more advice I seek on professionalism, job applications, and etc....the more confused I get. Im not so discouraged I want to throw the towel in, I'm just so confused as to what Im doing wrong that I don't even know HOW to approach anything anymore. I work crap hours (7pm to 6am) and make $11 an hour. I can only afford to live because of cheap rent and my parents pay for my car insurance, phone, and a good percentage of my living expenses.  I'm always tired, my body is getting slowy wrecked from my job, and the longer I go not using the skills/software I learned in school, the farther I fall behind. What's the point of learning expensive precise technical software if you can't find a job using it? 

My feelings:

I feel like people falsely judge me . I feel passively discriminated against for being a woman. If I was myself, my personality, my everything.....except with a beard, a deep voice, and third leg....I honestly dont think Id be in the same position. If my face was different and not like a 12 year old doll face or if I wasnt so middle class and on paper uninteresting....I honestly feel like my experiences would be different. Or Im just fundamentally unlikable - not sure. I don't need tons of money to be happy....I just want to contribute what I have to offer and actually use my potential in any capacity vs watch it wither away.  I'm pissed that our society breeds this kind of discontent. Highly capable and intelligent people who need to be challenged in life but arent industrious/smooth/lucky enough to actually sew the seeds they were born with. How efficient or advanced is a society that fails at utilizing its citizens to their full potential and ends up promoting and rewarding charlatans to the point there is a phrase ""fake it until you make it"" (until you go to jail). ?

I'm not necessarily looking for advice - unless you have something worthwhile to say. Really, I just want to hear anyone else's story who experiences my frustration.

I haven't been happy at my job for a while now. I could list the reasons why but I'll just add a couple: Low team morale, flawed product, substantial work limitations. The one thing I love about my job, however, is my manager. He cares about his team, is extremely dedicated to making us happy and to get the team working well. He knows I've wanted out for a few weeks, I would never admit, but about 4 people on our team left the company so he's pretty stressed, and broke the news that I wanted to join a different team in the organization. Instead of getting mad, he put in a good word for me and got me an interview (it'd be a promotion technically, just in a different department).

I had the interview and I kind of nailed it, and they said they wanted me to join but will have to go over logistics on when I can join. My manager kept me hired, has been treating me like this hasn't even happened and has patiently been waiting for them to make the offer. He is a gem.

So I have no prior IT experience other than building my own computers, troubleshooting my own problems, worked at a cellphone carrier before doing technical troubleshooting and a lot of problem solving with phones, and i went to a year long bootcamp and graduated for programming and web development. I guess they liked my problem solving skills, and experience in programming which is why i got the job. Anyways, the company is smaller than small i would say. They have been around since 1990 and their biggest client is a few auto dealerships. In total there are 7 people in the whole company, 2 of them being the owners(brothers).

Anyways, so they aren't training me at all, they give me a list of tasks and i need to complete them by the end of the day. I have no problem with that since with coding its a lot of finding the answer on my own and sink or swim situations aren't new to me. But i feel like im doing a lot more than what my initial position stated. Ive been shadowing too and ill be doing everything from desktop support to imaging computers and deploying them to doing wiring and setting up networks and everything in-between. They had me sign a w4 but no direct deposit, im supposed to work 8am-5pm but i would get here at 7:40 and nobody would show up until 9am. Nobody would call or text me, they havent even given me their phone numbers and they didnt even know mine. One of the employees went out of her way to get me everyones phone number. They agreed to move my time up to 8:30, so ive been getting here at that time and nobody shows up still until 9-9:30. I dont have a key or a code to get in because they wont give me one. They wont even give me the wifi password. ive asked for all of that stuff and they wont give me anything.

Lastly, we are supposed to get reimbursed for our mileage if we drive out to a client, but they dont even track that. I dont even know if they track my time worked because we dont even have a clock in system. It seems very disorganized and i didnt know if this was a normal thing for an IT company?

I'm not trying to bitch and moan i just wanted to see if this was all normal.

EDIT: I have been let go today in my first week because on top of dumping all of these things I had to learn, they expected me to go above and beyond and vacuum the floors and clean the work bench and help carry boxes and said my attitude seemed distant and I explained to them that it’s because this week i have gone through a lot in my personal life and tried to not have it reflect at work. Also because they think they don’t have the time to devote to help me learn like they want so I’ve been let go.

I've never done this before and consider myself a good reliable, employee but for some reason I found myself walking out of this service job.

To provide some context I graduated 2 years ago from a decent school with a degree in Marketing and was unhappy with the job prospects out of school. Without finding anything permanent, I ended up working a service job in the beverage industry and began to enjoy it over time. It was a cool, hip spot and I felt like I fit in with the culture. I ended up making my way into the manager role which was a welcome promotion but still left me deeply unsatisfied. I appreciated the experience and the responsibility it taught me but it still did not feel right and left me yearning for more. I also live in an area that is extremely slow in the off-season and has a huge rush in the summer months, so the winter months left me with little to do. Also the work environment became horrible over time. I realized my co-workers were extremely bad people and it began to effect me over time, mainly my mental health. I was treated so, so poorly by coworkers on countless occasions. I'd rather not get into specifics but I needed to get out of this small town bubble.

Because of my dissatisfaction, I decided to look for housing and work closer to my circle of friends where we attended our undergrad. I fell in love with that area and wanted desperately to go back. So I let my work know months advance that I had begun looking for housing and work and gave them a rough timeline of how things would play out. It's a tiny business and we are all pretty friendly for the most part so I thought this was just a normal conversation. Turns out they demoted me of my position and cut my hours drastically after hearing word of my notice. This meant loss of the few benefits I had and much, much lower pay after being there for a year. My time was cut in half. Not to mention the work environment had become worse than ever. I am currently down 10 pounds my normal weight and it's taken a noticeable toll. In hindsight, I should have never given my notice to the company but I thought it was the genuine right thing to do so they would be in the best shape come the busy summer months.

So the other day I decided that my life is too short to be miss-treated like this so I walked out. I explained to my boss the situation and they are not happy whatsoever.

Hi Reddit,

Going through a small dilemma here. I was recently offered a position at a startup. I'm currently working as a freelancer at a fortune 500 company.

Some details:
My current position pays me $34/hour. Full time annually that would be $65,280 assuming I work every day. I don't. Even though Im ""permalancing"" of course that means I dont get paid for holidays (such as this week, I have the full week off). I currently dont have health insurance (missed the window where I can sign up) nor do I have a 401k contribution.

The startup offered me a full time position for $70k annually including benefits. This includes insurance, paid time off, 401k contributions, commuter benefits, stipend for health-related costs ($400/year), free meals at work, and cooking classes.

Question is, should I move forward and accept or try to get a full time offer at my current company? I have only been at my current company for a little over a year, and I'm pretty sure the only reason I was considered and offered the position at the startup was because my current company is so well-known.

Any help/guidance would be truly appreciated.

Thanks.

971,9sv0dq,False,None,30,"Should I stay in a miserable job while looking for a new one, or should I quit and try looking after moving to a new city?",careerguidance,"Hello All,

I will try to keep things brief while adequately explaining my situation. Basically, I have been working my first real job out of college for just over a year and a half now. I graduated with a double major in History and Chinese from my university, and found my current job on the other side of the country.

Basically, I work for the American branch of a large state-owned Chinese company on the West Coast. My position is a “Technical Translator”, meaning I’m meant to translate technical documents and provide interpretation. It seemed right up my alley when I started.

Now, I’ve realized I am completely miserable here. If you’ve never worked at a Chinese company before, things tend to be a bit chaotic- very little planning, work way outside of your job description, and generally lots of moments that make you question your sanity. I interned at another Chinese company before so I kind of had an idea of what to expect. It is definitely wearing me down now. I am either spending weeks at a time with literally nothing to do, or I am having periods of crazy overtime and spontaneous cross-country business trips. The atmosphere at work has also become toxic with lots of people moving to other jobs.

Moreover, I am extremely unhappy living here in Southern California. All of my family, who I am very close with, are on the East Coast and everything is crazy expensive here. Don’t get me wrong, it has its merits, but it is NOT for me.

These factors have been wearing down on me so much that I ended up getting diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for the first time. At the beginning of this year, I realized that I needed to go. However, 10 months later I have had no success. This is mainly because I resolved not to quit until I had found a better job.

My strategy has been to look for jobs in the aviation industry, where I work now. However, because my current job is such a niche position, I have seriously been struggling to find jobs I can even realistically apply for. Even then, my biggest handicap has been my liberal arts background. I know majoring in liberal arts was a huge mistake, but I am stuck with it. I thought I could use my experience in the industry, but it has not come out for me at all. Everything wants either engineering or software design backgrounds. I only managed to be interviewed for one job this year, and they told me I was “unconventional” and that most people they hire are engineers, even for non-technical positions. Everything else has been rejection after rejection.

Geographically, I have been applying for jobs only in places I want to live, like back east or in places like Colorado, where I’ve always wanted to live. I'm wondering if it would be better to just quit this job and move somewhere I would want to live. I've read many times that finding a job is much harder when you don't have one already. At the same time, I also wonder if a lot of jobs I apply for don't consider me to be a serious candidate because I live so far away from them. 

My question at this point is, what would be your recommended course of action given my situation? Should I just quit my job and move somewhere I want to live, then look for a job? I have enough savings to live off of for months, but I know it is harder to find a job when you’re unemployed. Should I just suck it up and go back to school for something more technical? Should I just keep sticking it out here until I find something better? For more context, I am relatively young: 24 years old.

I know things should be kept objective here but the emotional part of this situation is just killing me. I am starting to think this niche job is all I can ever be, and I will be stuck here away from my family forever. I am absolutely miserable here but can’t see any escape. I’m hoping I can get a more realistic perspective from the people here.

Thank you for reading, and I apologize for the lengthy post.

Edit: thanks everyone for the variety of viewpoints and advice. I can’t reply to all of them but I can say they are very helpful and will factor tremendously in my decisions moving forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9sv0dq/should_i_stay_in_a_miserable_job_while_looking/,56,"1.

I knew that I wanted to do some travelling as well so I got a job as a Support Worker with children with learning difficulties to get some Clinical Experience before travelling. 


A year later, I leave my job and travel to Australia alone. But I get into a relationship before I leave. Why? Well I'm stupid and fell in love. Anyways, so I travel and come home after 5 months and decide to start working on my career again. Every possibility goes through my head. 


I finally decide to go back to studying so I can eventually become a Clinical Psychologist hoping that through University I can become re-motivated.

I’m 35 years old.  I have a wife and two kids (4 yrs and 3 months old).  I currently work around 50 hrs/week as a welder.  I make $45,000/year.  I’m the sole bread winner for the family.  Needless to say, money is tight.  We never go without anything we need, but there’s not a lot left over at the end of the month.

I weld because it’s the only think I’m really qualified to do.  I hate it.  It’s mind numbing and hard on me physically.  

I spent most of my early adulthood in the Army.  
I got out with a pretty nasty case of PTSD.  Out of pride I never really sought treatment, instead I self medicated with alcohol.  In the last five years I was convicted of a DUI and 4 public intoxes.  My credit is shit due to poor drunken decisions.

Almost two years ago I broke down and finally went to a 28 day inpatient treatment center for my alcoholism.  I’ve been sober for almost a year now.

This last year of sobriety has brought me a lot of clarity.  I want better for my family and myself.  I think a big part of that will be to improve our financial situation.

So, a bit of context to my title: I graduated university with a degree in criminology and psychology. I have a real curiosity about the human psyche, supporting our vulnerable and justice. 

After graduation, I took the first job I could get - investigating and intervening in cases of child abuse and neglect. It was soul crushing to say the least. I quickly burn-out and moved on to a role I feel is more suited to my studies. 

At the moment I work in a local level court, providing case management for people who are in the community awaiting sentencing. Essentially, my job involves supporting people experiencing things like drug addiction, mental illness, homelessness, and trauma. It’s a rewarding, but equally soul crushing and stressful job. I see a lot of the dark side of society and frankly, it’s taking a toll on me. 

As a result of all the downtime from COVID-19, I’ve realised my work is making me anxious and depressed, and that maybe, this line of work isn’t for me at all. Ideally I want to do something that makes me happy; or at least, doesn’t fill me with dread on a Sunday night. 

The decision feels easy but I’m also trapped - my current salary is amazing and I have a debt as a result of my studies. I live in Australia so I’m not worried about the financial impact of the debt, just the sense of guilt that I went and racked up a debt for a career I will ultimately not be pursuing.

I take care of every aspect of the business including calls, bookkeeping, budgeting, client meetings, marketing, grant writing, IT issues, etc.  This nonprofit is pretty successful and we have been around for about 4 years.

What I am confused about, is what kind of jobs would I look for? I don't believe I have the experience to be an ED in a large organization, but I think I could certainly do more than an administrative level too.

1. You get talked down to and shouted by rich people almost everyday, which is incredibly frustrating especially when you're from a poor background.
2. The business in general is very discriminatory. They only hire white, attractive people (usually females) for customer facing work. Whereas anyone of colour - or anyone who doesn't fit into this category is hidden away - which is something I hate being a part of.
3. The company's customer care is incredibly poor. You essentially have to ask for contributions from the customers if something goes wrong which is very awkward and you get a lot of abuse for it.

Did that for a couple of years, then traded up to a job doing support for a Microsoft vendor company only to have my entire team laid off and outsourced to another country after another couple of years there.

I was without a full time job for about a year, but was able to stay afloat running sound in a freelance capacity.  I was eventually able to get another IT job doing the same kinds of general stuff that I was doing while I was in college over 10 years ago, but they keep me part time so that they don't have to pay me any benefits (it's a state job).

I have pretty much divided my professional time between running sound (if you can actually find work in my area doing that, it pays minimum wage, and people don't even want to pay you that) and doing very general IT stuff that doesn't require a lot of specific knowledge.  I'm now 35 and not sure where to go from here... I have nothing saved for retirement, and my credit card bills are adding up.  I keep applying for jobs but rarely get an interview, and out of those I never get a job offer.  I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I'm not an idiot either.  I can learn almost anything I set my mind to, but most people my age have a specific skillset that they have honed by now that will get them good paying jobs, and I'm still basically doing entry level work.

I'm too broke and already have too many student loans to go back to school for another degree.

My boss actually got really angry at me for not knowing as much. I suffered mild depression before and now I’m scared its going to make a come back.

What do I do and how do I feel confident tomorrow?,careerguidance,"I am a recent university grad and I'm currently working at an office for a summer job before I start my post-grad in the fall. The majority of my team is in their 40s, and they often talk about their young kids and since starting I've found it hard to relate to them. They have placed in a cubicle far away from where everyone else sits, so it's made it more difficult for me to get to know them. Despite this, I've been pretty friendly.

Over the past few weeks, I've had a strong feeling that my co-workers have talked about me behind my back. Usually when I leave after asking them a question I hear them whispering. As an intern, I've also received very minimal work and I usually do one task a day or spend the day refreshing my email. When I ask if anything needs to be done, they say there's nothing I can do to help. Today, one of my co-workers gave a filing task. She didn't really explain what the files were. I arranged the files and put them in a folder not thinking much of it. About 30 minutes later she comes up to me, saying that my work looked unprofessional and that if I need help with filing and stapling things together to ask the receptionist because the receptionist is actually good at filing and completing the task. I think she could tell from my facial expressions that this comment hurt me, so she said it again.

For the last hour of the day, I felt really shitty. I felt really stupid as well. Earlier in the day before the incident happened, the same coworker asked me to email her a document, which I did, however she did not receive it. She made another co-worker watch me re-send the email to make sure I was ""doing it correctly"" (really? you don't think I can send an email correctly?) and for some odd reason the email went through.

I'm feeling a bit crappy about myself and my capabilities. At this point I'm a bit nervous about asking my co-workers for work/things to do because it feels like they think I'm stupid or socially inept. A lot of the tasks are so menial, so it feels like I can't even ""show"" them that I'm smart or a hard worker.

There are so many people too afraid of confrontation they will ignore your sloppy work and just fix it themselves. Your coworker telling you you did something poorly means you did something poorly. Fix it, learn from it and do better next time. 

When I was 18 I was learning my trade in the military. If I messed up a disgruntled chief would get in my face and scream at me. Call me a “fucking retard”. And sleep deprive me until I got it right. Trust me, you’ll survive. 

Lastly, e-mails do not get lost in the ether. It’s not 1992. If a person didn’t get your email it’s because you fucked up. Don’t ever tell a person ‘weird, I sent it’. You should have learned that in college.  ",2018-07-13 01:55:11

993,hlq4be,False,Advice,5,How to figure out your ideal job/career in your 30s?,careerguidance,"(Apologies for any formatting issues from mobile)

So a bit of background to understand where I’m at before I go into my big question:

-Located in NYC, USA

-Degree in economics (BA)

-Worked for the same company (Fortune 100 CPG/food goods company) since graduation - 8 years now

-Occupied several roles starting from customer service to sales operations to project management

-Current role is a project manager with a primary focus on process improvement and business operations projects, almost all strictly internal-facing and all strongly cross-departmental as I sit in a sales/commercial team

-Very safe company to work for with pretty good benefits (8/10) but the growth outlook and upward mobility is low

My main issue now is that I’m not happy in this PM role and I feel like every day I’m going to work just to burn 8 hours. My motivation for the role and the company’s mission is near zero. I keep find myself being pessimistic about everything and avoiding any participation during meetings so that I don’t take on any extra work or get assigned to any task forces. My project list is never ending and even if I worked at 110% efficiency the demands will never slow down. 

In terms of my work performance, prior to starting this role I had been a “rock star” employee, getting promoted every 18-24 months and taking on significant new responsibilities to help drive the customer service and sales operations teams toward supporting our sales goals. 18 months ago we restructured our department and in the reorganization the sales operations team was absorbed into another unit of the company that I had no interest in being a part of. I was offered this role of being a PM and leading the restructuring project but I was in way over my head and since the project involved a lot of sensitive HR points I was kept out of the loop of several key decisions from the executive level team and I was left trying to decipher why decisions were made that didn’t make any sense to me in terms of processes and personnel allocations. There were no other options for a next role at the time and I had a minor interest in being a PM so I accepted the assignment. 

Now we’re here and I hate the idea of working in this role any longer. The problem is that I don’t know what to do next. I’m not sure if I hate project management or just project management at my current company. I’m already studying for the PMP certificate since I feel it would help “close the chapter” on the past 18 months and I feel that would help show I accomplished something from this misery. In terms of other roles I’ve always liked the analytical side of my roles but I’m not sure if analytics is a role I would enjoy as the responsibilities vary from company to company. I’m also very uninterested in my current industry (consumer packages goods) and taking a leap to something more STEM related that I find interesting would be a challenge I’m assuming. To sum it up I’m confused about what to do next and get frustrated when I try to start the process of figuring this out. 

Where I need help is figuring out what to do next and what roles might be a good lead to start searching. I’ve read through the BoL resources and tried doing a few google searches on figuring out my “perfect” job but most of those quizzes either seem like junk or charge a fee to get results. If anyone has been in a similar situation I’d like to hear how you got thru this as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hlq4be/how_to_figure_out_your_ideal_jobcareer_in_your_30s/,52,"There's no 'one size fits all' answer I can give you for this.

I left my first post college job after a year and a half, and if I’d only known then what I known now, I never would have left.

A lot of things happened last year and I was constantly comparing myself to my peers I graduated with. Everyone else seemed to find their dream job and things were moving along. Since the job I had wasn’t my “dream” job I was constantly looking for ways to get out of it.

The job I quit to go to was a very bad choice but at that time I thought I needed to do something different. I’m not joking when I say that job was terrible and I quit after a week. I got lucky that another company offered me a role the same week and I started shortly after. I’ve been at my newest job for about 4 months and I’ve still been regretting my decision. This job isn’t as bad as the last but it has its issues (poor management, lack of training, lack of benefits). Instead of having an actual role or career path, I’m just an office admin.

I wish I would have just went back to my old job after I quit my last after a week. I tried job searching again but I wasn’t liking any of the jobs in my area. I briefly considered becoming a teacher and took steps to get a teaching certificate but I realized I would not be a good fit dealing with kids all day. I went on multiple interviews and for jobs I thought I had a good chance with I was passed along with no interview offer. I was tried of the rejection and answering bs interview questions and bureaucracy, I missed my old company.

I sucked up my pride at the beginning of this month and asked my old boss from my first company if I could come back to work. She offered me my old job back and I am
going through the rehire process now. 

I felt embarrassed and besides from my immediate family knows I’m changing jobs  again and going back to my first company.

It was yesterday when I was scrolling through Facebook that I saw two separate people I graduated with posting about starting new jobs that were a complete 180 than what they started out doing. 

The first one was a girl who’d been with the same company almost 3 years if you count her internship experience. She’s now quit and working as a full time substitute teacher. The other was a guy who moved out of state after graduation and seemed to be a successful sales rep who moved back home. Initially he was going through the process to become a teacher but has now accepted a job as a vet tech at an animal hospital. 

It finally made me realize that a lot of people also have trouble deciding on a career, and especially in your early 20s you’ll make a lot of big decisions, regret some, benefit from others, etc. I’m feeling a little less ashamed at starting back at the same company but I know it’s whats best for me at the moment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/evb9b0/did_you_eventually_realize_a_lot_of_people_dont/,54,"You are not alone.

Seems like you want the latter. What you need is first, more years of experience. No ones gonna let you be the architect of anything if you haven’t paid your dues. Architects I know live and breathe frameworks and languages better than I understand my mother tongue. This only comes from more than a decade of coding.


Second, you gotta move away from small-medium companies that all have the same old deal, some backend framework , some frontend framework, same database, same issues, same features, etc... and move onto bigger companies (FAANG companies for example) it doesn’t have to be one of those companies with super cutthroat hiring practices, but it’s gotta be a big one. These companies you get to shine and move up to the ladder of implementing, to design, to architect. The problems these companies face are vast and truly endless, and the ladder to climb never ends, so you’ll be able to find your niche within they company.

Obviously you gotta study up for the interviews. These big companies just love their leetcode style interviews and that’s not gonna change anytime soon. If you don’t live in a major city, you’ll have to move too. Also, be prepared to be hired as midlevel or even junior engineer. It’s just how those big companies do things ",2019-08-11 04:03:49
999,cd1qan,False,None,44,"Help! Any advice for me? Nearly 40, looking to start over.",careerguidance,"Hello, reddit.  I'm here looking for as many people's opinions as I can get, and hopefully even some specific advice as to what I should do with my life.  I'll be 39 years old next month (seems like I was 25 yesterday), and it's time for me to make a big change.  My problem is, I have never had many interests that were a driving force or a passion in terms of career, and I have never had any particular skillset that is advanced enough to consider unique or particularly desirable to employers.  

A summarized description of my work history up to this point is as follows:

I started working at a very young age, and have always been a valued employee at any job I've ever had.  At around 21 years old I started working off the books running a coffee truck route in New York (where I currently reside).  I made a large amount of money doing that, but I was young, foolish, and of the mindset that the money train would never stop, so I spent wildly. Eventually, the business began to deteriorate due to many factors outside of my control, but it basically began a decline into obsolescence due to an industry wide refusal to change and adapt with the times.  I continued this job for 13 years.  That's 13 years of working completely off the books, without benefits or any form of retirement investments, as well as several years at the end which were rough enough financially to wipe out anything I had in savings at the time.  During those last years I did decide to go to college however, and I pursued a bachelors in psychology.  I naively took loans out every semester, and never graduated.  In fact I dropped out with just one course left to complete my degree program.  My current job, which I've had since the end of my stint as a coffee truck driver, is in the marine transportation industry.  I got the job, with no background in the field, via the recommendation of a friend.  The job pays very well for someone without a degree (over 100k), and I've managed to learn quite a bit in the 4 years I've been here.  My problem is, I don't like it, and I feel it's not going to last.  Not going to last for several reasons, including but not limited to the fact that the company may actually fold within the coming year due to an astoundingly bad couple of years marred with incidents and loss of business.  I should also mention that my time here doesn't really qualify me for work in the same field with different companies, because it's very specific to this particular company.  In addition, the pay for comparable jobs at similar companies pay about half of what I'm making now.   I'm trying to come up with a ""what next"" plan and I'm really struggling.


I feel I'm a very competent person, and I don't feel limited by my ability to learn any new job/skill.  But I'm almost 40.  I need a job that pays well, and that I'm interested in enough to want to stay for good.  I would also ideally like to find a job which allows me the flexibility to travel (I've held jobs for my entire life that have been extremely inflexible in terms of taking days off), but I understand that I can't make that priority number one.  I should mention that although I am swimming in student debt, I would consider going back to school (for no longer than 2 years), if the resulting potential job paid well enough for me to live comfortably and pay off my debt.  As I've said, my interests are varied and I do feel confident that I could learn most anything, but if it means anything at all I've always been incredibly fascinated by insects, traveling, plants and animals. I am also open to moving almost anywhere, including out of the country if that's what it takes. 


Thanks for listening, reddit.  Hope that all came across as intended.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cd1qan/help_any_advice_for_me_nearly_40_looking_to_start/,51,"Personally I would put your career thoughts on hold until you get some serious financial management skills. You state that you currently make over $100K per year and are swimming in debt. That's shocking to be honest. I appreciate that university is very expensive in the US, but with such a high salary you should feel like you're living comfortably and on track to pay off your debts within a set amount of time. 

Go see a financial advisor, or debt consolidator. You need to stop the leak before you drown. 

I suspect one of the reasons you're trying to find a new career is you're probably so unhappy and stressed out by your financial situation that you think some perfect job is going to come fix everything, but that's simply not the case. 

No career can make you happy and it's not the salary that helps you pay down your bills, it's adjusting your lifestyle. ",2019-07-14 10:52:51
