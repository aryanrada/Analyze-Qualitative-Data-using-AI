Just straight up not prepared but always around? Met him a few years back, he was in 4 of my classes. He was always surprised when an exam hit, he sat next to me one day and asked if there was an exam on account of everyone having a Scantron in front of them. I told him yes, there’s an exam. He literally got up and left. Didn’t take the exam. Next exam rolls around, he seems to know what’s going on because he brings a Scantron. Only a Scantron though. No pencil, not even his backpack or anything. I luckily give him one. 

He started complaining to me a few weeks later that he was failing and the professor was out to get him. I saw him around off and on through the years. I hope he got it together.

a0jwbr,Professor locked me out from taking a quiz for showing up at exactly 8am (when class starts),"I showed up at exactly 8am (the clock literally just changed from 7:59) and when I went to open the door, the professor slammed it back against me and gave me a nasty look.

This guy lets in kids who are late but slammed the door for me, at 8am. The quiz had not even started. 

Since I had to take a 0 my quiz average dropped significantly (this is 1/3 of our grade).

I went up to him after class (he let me in after the quiz) and he told me too bad, I should’ve showed up at 7:59.

I WAS ON TIME. I feel like this is incredibly unreasonable and I do not know what to do.

Edit: emailed department chair, she basically talked to him and said that the quiz had already started so I need to go to his office hours and try and deal with it on my own. 

Edit: my final grade drops from an A- to a B+ (only 3 points - but still significant) 

Edit: appreciate the somewhat harsh feedback, I do need to be earlier. I literally show up like 7:57 every class and never have a problem. I just thought it was crazy to make my grade suffer when I was there at the stated time. But yes, I know how important timing is IRL

fph9ow,Can we just talk about how the coronavirus stimulus bill completely excludes us college students?,"According to the bill, adults that made less than $75k will receive $1,200, **HOWEVER** those who were claimed as dependents by their parents will not receive any money from the stimulus package. Even if you filed taxes as an individual. Nor will your parents be receiving the $500 check if you are not less than 17 years old.

Personally I am just super disappointed. This money would’ve helped me pay for my college tuition but **yet again** the government purposely excludes college students. There seems to be a lot of outrage amongst college students on twitter as well.

Edit: and of course the “college students have enough and don’t need anything else” crowd shows up lol

**Bottom line is, our parent’s tax returns don’t directly cover our own expenses. Not everyone is privileged to have their college paid for and just because others have it worse, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t benefit.

bli2wf,Someone got caught cheating on their final today.,"So today during one of my finals, I hear the teacher ask this one guy what he's doing. The guy says nothing, and the teacher demands the jacket sitting on his lap. Guy says ""why would I give my jacket, are you being serious right now?""

Teacher was serious and got the jacket. A phone with presumably answers on it was found. Teacher immediately says ""shut down your computer and leave. You just failed my class"". 

He's already a notoriously hard teacher and has a heavy Chinese accent, so the class was extremely difficult to begin with. But now this student has spent an entire semester, all to be kicked out on his LAST day in class. 

Be careful guys and don't cheat. This was an eye opener. Usually teachers have been lenient and when someone gets caught they just either get a warning or point reduction. But seeing that made my heart drop. It's not worth failing the class and possibly getting expelled!!

Do you guys have any cheating stories that either you yourself did (hypothetically of course), or did someone in any of your classes ever get caught cheating? What happened?

Edit: when I say ""be careful guys and don't cheat"" I'm not saying be careful *while* cheating. I'm saying be careful to make sure you don't even accidentally glance at a neighbors paper, or pull out your phone just to check how much time you have left etc. I've seen people wrongly accused of cheating before due to a stupid mistake like that. So that's what I mean by be careful. Sorry for lack of clarification.

Edit2: yes my school does expel students caught. But it's up to the teacher to report it to the dean. If it's a major class they typically do. If it's an elective they usually just give an F. My school isn't ""lenient"". Idk if he got expelled or not. But that teachers about to be fired for being a horrible teacher, so I doubt he even wants to report anything to the dean.

dvgbar,Writing Prof Here: How to Add to Essay Length Without Fluff or Format Cheating,"Alright folks, instead of the normal depressing content on the sub, Christmas is coming early ...though perhaps a bit boring. This is like getting socks. But hey, I know a lot of you need socks, so it's not that bad.

Common problem I'm sure a lot of you are facing is how to reach essay minimum page requirements. I'm here to help. This is only really looking at one specific technique, there's lots of others, and maybe I'll do write ups on them also. The key here though is that this *isn't* about just padding your essay. It's about reaching the minimum length *by doing what you're actually expected to do.* It's like cheating on a test by smuggling notes in your brain.

Let's take a hypothetical essay discussing polarizing foods. Here's a stereotypically bad bit of (hypothetical) student writing:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza. This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.

Shit. We just covered pineapple in like 2 lines of text. That was going to be the centerpiece of the essay!

To improve on this, always look for more clarity, depth, and specificity. We'll start with the first sentence. ...Is there evidence of this debate we can point to?

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post ranked pineapple on pizza as the most controversial food.

Good start, but what lots of details are missing.

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial and pineapple was the clear winner.

Better, but we're using an internet sources a lot of folks aren't familiar with. Is it credible? More detail helps:

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th.

Our first sentence has now become longer than the entire original paragraph just be expanding on the ""causes a lot of debate"" idea. Now let's move on to ""In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza.""

First we need to tell the audience who this guy is.

>Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust.

After that, we should give more detail about just what the study found (I'm making up the study, btw, but Haidt does study disgust). We should provide more detail about the specific research results, and can add a bit of narrative about the research methods as well.

>In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is ""strongly dislike"" and 5 is ""strongly like,"" 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3.

In the original, 40% disliking it didn't actually tell us it was controversial, it told us only a lot of people hate it -- but we need to know how many like it as well, and the number of ambivalent people is another useful detail. We can go into more depth with some added context drawn from other questions in the study:

>While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it.

Good, that tells us how it compares to an uncontroversial topping. How does it rate among other controversial toppings though?

>Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

Holy cow, now we've got ourselves a real life college essay paragraph. Let's put the pieces together and see how she looks:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th. Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust. In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is ""strongly dislike"" and 5 is ""strongly like,"" 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3. While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it. Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

That's more than half a page (TNR 12, double spaced).

Now what about the last line from the original? ""This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.""

Cut it. Don't need it. If I clearly showed you something, I don't need to tell you that I clearly showed you it. You know.

But wait, we're not done! We can get even more mileage out of this by commenting on the limitations of the study:

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and there may be a regional preference.

Again, we can expand this with greater levels of detail and specificity.

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and regional preferences may have influenced the results. Food preferences and traditions are known to vary from one region to the next, and pizza in particular has regional variations such as the Chicago deep dish. It may be that in some places were pineapple is more popular, pineapple on pizza is less of a contentious issue.

And, if you need to squeeze a little more mileage out of it, add a bit of your research narrative:

>However, in researching this topic, I was not able to find a study that compared regional attitudes towards pineapple on pizza.

That's all there is to it.

...One huge caveat of course. Expanding your writing in this way first requires that you have a clue what the heck you're talking about. You need to have done the research, have actual good sources, and understand the sources and your subject to be able to discuss it in a nuanced manner.

d2h1fz,Doing a project minutes before my presentation.,"I was told this would be appreciated here.

I'm 21 and in my senior year of college but I know there's people here that can relate to this in one way or another.

So last semester, in the final weeks of the semester, I had a powerpoint presentation due in my nutrition class. We were all assigned a vitamin and had to make a presentation about this vitamin.

This project was assigned to us on the first day of the semester and I knew this was going to be a quick, easy A, so like every student ever, I said ""meh, I'll do it later."" WELL, later never came but you know what did come? The day of the presentations. So I stroll into this class, 9:30 am, iced coffee in hand, laid back, no concern over anything. The kid (S) next to me (B), leans over and goes

S: How's your presentation look?

B: Ha, what presentation?

S: ...

B: ...

S: ...

S: The presentation that's due today.

Let me just say that my heart has never dropped so low, out my ass, and into the center of the Earth so fast in my life.

B: ...oh shit.

So, my last name starts with A... and the professor (P) goes:

P: Alright, we're gonna start the presentations soon and I'm just gonna go in alphabetical order.

Thank fuck that there were a few people before me that also had last names that started with A. So I I M M E D I A T E L Y open a fresh powerpoint, make a title card, and start Googling like I've never Googled in my life. I pulled up the project rubric in a small window on my laptop and I literally just started copying and pasting every question that was required to be in the presentation.

I literally made a decent looking in 10 minutes and long story short, I got an A somehow. I somehow got an A on the most rushed piece of a shit thing I have ever produced in my academic career. It was so hard for me not to laugh while I was presenting and S was sitting there giggling his ass off cause he knew what I had done and that he had saved my ass.

But yeah, don't procrastinate, set reminders, keep a planner, use a calendar, something.

If anyone wants to see the powerpoint, I can post it in the comments.

gu2w6f,My Study Tips as a 4.0 Biology Pre-Med Senior in College.,"
My Study Tips as a 4.0 Senior in College

Hey guys so I wanted to make a post that I hope will help some of you with how to maximize studying efficiency and increase your chance at getting straight A’s in med school pre reqs and college in general.

Study tip 1: Prioritize Classes, each class and individual professor has a level of difficulty and importance to your overall college career. Prioritize classes with high importance (pre reqs and major requirements) over other less important classes. Additionally, prioritize classes that appear more difficult over those that are less difficult.

Study tip 2: Balance your schedule with 1-3 difficult classes and 1-2 moderate to easy classes. This will help you not get too overwhelmed.

Study tip 3: For clases which are heavy on memorization, space out studying the two weeks before a test one hour each day. As the exam approaches, study for longer stretches of time the week before, reviewing sections of material. The three days before an exam do a Meta Review of all material, three consecutive days. This will maximize information retention and give you both the nitty gritty details and the overall picture. As you do the meta review try and explain concepts to yourself in your head. 
Note: I only use this study technique for very difficult or important classes as it is somewhat labor intensive and takes up a bit of time. 

Study tip 4: Go to class, oftentimes a profesor will point out things they want you to pay close attention to or that they think is important, remember you are not only taking X course, you are taking X course with your specific professor.... simply knowing the material is not enough, you must also know what your professor wants of you.

Study tip 5: Use rate my professor.
When possible use rate my profesor to find professors that have positive reviews. Sometimes bad professors are unavoidable, but don’t make your life any harder than it is by getting someone who doesn’t know how to teach to their strengths.

Study tip 6: Form a study group and take turns attempting to teach each other sections of the material. Teaching a subject is the best way to learn it, I have used this technique to great effect with my fellow study partners. I also found this very helpful for concept heavy classes such as organic chemistry and parts of Biochemistry.

Study tip 7: Be proactive, do not wait until the last minute to turn in an assignment, turn it in days or weeks before if possible. Last minute deadlines can cause unnecessary stress and can be annoying if something else comes up. Do yourself a favor and don’t procrastinate.

Study tip 8: Utilize your time efficiently. If you find that you spend a lot of time on your phone or watching TV at a certain time of the day, utilize this time to instead go over some material or get some EC’s, Research, etc. done. This will give you more time to be productive during the day. Additionally, try and give the appropriate amount of time during the week to classes you find difficult and less time to those you find easy or do well in. Do not spend too much time on classes that you don’t need to.

Study tip 9: OVER-PREPARE for the first test. You don’t know how hard a class really is until you are tested on the material. Over study for the first test so that you do well in it. After this point you should have a slight grasp on your abilities and can make a judgement as to how much time is appropriate to get the grade you want on the next test. 

Study tip 10: Go to office hours, these times are invaluable as you can get one on one instruction with either your TAs or Professors. Not only is this good for getting them to know you and perhaps writing good recommendation letters, but it can also give you a leg up in knowing what material they’ll likely test you on or what they want you to focus on. Remember, like I said, you are not only taking X class you are taking X class with a specific professor. The professor is a huge component in the success you may have in a class. Knowing your professor and what they expect from you is an invaluable piece of information.

Study tip 11: For math and physics classes do NOT simply read slides. This will not help. You MUST do practice problems in order to get familiar with the material. There is no other way to learn math other than practice.

Study tip 12: If you do not understand a concept ask for help from your professor or try and find the answer utilizing resources such as your textbook, online databases, or YouTube/Reddit.

Study tip 13: The night before a big exam, go over the information in your head. I don’t know how this works for me but it just does, somehow I manage to capture very specific information while doing this. It might not work for everyone but go ahead and give it a shot and see if it works.

Study tip 14: Study in the library, there will be less distractions and you will feel more productive.

Study tip 15: DO NOT do all nighters, they are the byproduct of under preparation . There is never a reason to do one.

Study tip 16: Look at homework as a learning opportunity not simply an assignment. I can’t even count the times that homework questions have appeared in an altered form within my exams. 

Study tip 17: don’t be afraid of utilizing free tutoring services from your institution.

Study tip 18: Finally, as a last piece of advice, don’t place so much validation or importance on a three digit number. Yes it is important, but ones mental and physical health comes first. If you feel yourself getting burnt out, give your head a break. You are not defined by a three digit number. Do the best you can and you’ll go far.

fh6l6f,Some tips for online classes,"I saw a lot of stuff on r/college lately from students who have not taken online classes before. Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes.

Tips:

1. First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into ""relax"" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it.

2. Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise.

3. PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes.

4. Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult.

5. Usually, you'd be in class about 2.5 hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you ~2.5 hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a ""class time"" for yourself can really help.

6. Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with 4 or 5 slightly different versions of this.

The best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. 

Other considerations:

1. Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. 

2. Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that.

3. Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end.

4. Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end.

a09q25,Does anyone else get discouraged when people who cheat on everything and learn nothing make better grades than those who put the work in?,"I know I am furious about it. I used to never care if people cheated, but a classmate made a comment that sent me over the edge. I should mention I am nervous as hell this time of year because I need to maintain my GPA to stay eligible for classes. So I take my grades super seriously lately. 

But there are a few people who blatantly cheat on everything and never learned a single thing all semester except how to say 'no comprendo' to every single question (I'm talking about a Spanish class) and then laugh about it with their group. Those guys also all have A's. 

One guy mentioned to me that he bets I have a high grade if he can get a 90% for the class. I was instantly furious because my average is less than a 80 even though I bend over backwards for that class and need the B to stay in school. 

Is it normal for people to get discouraged like that? You freak out over this class yet someone else barely remembers they're in it and they are the one with the better grade. I'm really not sure how to feel or if I should bring it up with the professor.

fgb8xm,MEGATHREAD: Colleges announcing cancellations due to COVID-19,"**CHANGES**: Due to more and more colleges cancelling, which is good because that was the point of this post, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up. Starting now, **I will not add your university unless your comment specifically includes all of the info for me to add, in the format of Name, From, Until, and a source.** Date announced is assumed to be the date you made your post, unless otherwise specified.

Thought it'd be nice to consolidate them somewhere. The below list is fairly close to chronological order. I suspect that the shutdowns announced on Monday have essentially forced a lot of colleges' hands into shutting down: any school that hasn't announced a shutdown by the end of today will just look bad. Here's the list of schools so far that have cancelled classes in some major capacity:

Vacate dorms means the school has asked all students to move out of dorms. Extended means the school had originally announced cancellations, but added more dates or restrictions following it.

fxu5bu,Undergrads: Would you want text reminders about class deadlines?,"During the chaos of online instruction, I know a lot of students are having problems with deadlines (I'm being pretty much completely flexible on deadlines at this point as long as people do the work) but it got me wondering: Would you want text reminders about deadlines? Reminders from the LMS sometimes get lost.

I'm doing course planning for an upcoming class and looking at doing text reminders.  It would be 100% optional and in addition to content pushed out through the LMS/email.  I would encourage students to use a bogus phone number (ie, Google Voice number) if they want to keep their actual number private.

Thoughts? Is it worth my time to set this up for students?

I thought I’d post an update since 1) a lot of y’all said I should, 2) a lot of y’all offered up some advice, and thanks for that!

I ended up going with the mug/candy suggestion. I wish I had taken a picture of the gift before I gave it to him (pretty standard though, a green Christmas mug that I filled with a hot chocolate thing and a handful of loose, wrapped chocolates). I spent well over 30 minutes standing in TJ Maxx trying to decide on which mug to get him (because I’m dumb and indecisive), but I found one that said something about the North Pole or some shit and was a good size to fit treats in.

I also included a little card, basically just saying how much I appreciated his enthusiasm and friendliness, especially since being a student can be really rough sometimes. I didn’t write *too* much because I didn’t wanna pour my heart out and write some long thing about my mental health and the fact this semester has been unbearably hard at times, so I basically just left it at “thanks for being cheerful and making it easier” or whatnot. 

He seemed super delighted and thanked me like a thousand times. I promised I’d continue to stop in next semester and just... thanks y’all. I can be a really anxious person and I overthink things a lot (i.e. spending an ungodly amount of time looking at mugs) and if y’all hadn’t been so encouraging and helpful on my original post, I probably would’ve been too nervous to get and give him a gift.

djizky,Pulled four all nighters and ended up sleeping through my midterm.,"So it’s my freshman year of college and I’ve been here for about two months by now. Specifically, I attend an art school that’s relatively rigorous in terms of workload. For the most part though I had been able to manage my work fine, but then midterms rolled in. I was pulling all nighters left and right for all of my projects and getting 0-2 hours of sleep almost every day. Today, I had a midterm in art history and I had the bright idea to once again, pull another all nighter. I thought I had the willpower to do so but I ended up passing out at around 7am and then waking up in horror at around 3pm. I had slept through all of my 37 alarms (Also apologies to my roommate I’m trying to get better at it) and missed my midterm. I frantically emailed my professor and told him my situation and if there’s a remedy to this whole disaster, but I have a good feeling he’s not going to cut me any slack. I don’t really know what to do at this point and if I should just withdraw from the class because the only grades we get are a midterm, final paper, and final exam. (the midterm is 25% of our grade haha end me) So if I get a 0 on the midterm is there really any hope for getting that up to a passing grade? Also if I fail a class does that mean I have to wait another year to graduate because I was a couple of credits short? I’m honestly just confused and miss my dog

That I have to pay for my own tuition. Yet, they can afford it, but refuse to. And I just want to know...why. Why don’t they want to help their children? My brother had to drop out of college because he couldn’t afford it (even with getting loans) and now he’s working two jobs trying to pay off his debt, provide for himself, and save up for college. And when I see him he just looks so sad. My sister is the same. Lost when it comes to college and all 3 of us are just tying to figure it out.

It’s not perfect, but I do encourage you to reach out to your profs when things go south. Some are more receptive than others. I generally accommodate these things.

I talked about sucking balls in front of 30 students","I was the quiet emo/goth kid in HS and I had a lot of social anxiety (I wasn't hardcore emo, I just wore a lot of black and was quite tomboyish so..goth?).  I've ran out of a room crying once when everyone looked at me to answer a question in class.
I wanted to change this about myself, so I went into college as a Communication major, marketing minor, joined a marketing club (now on the executive board), and got a job in hospitality and another job in sales. 

I have gotten a lot better EXCEPT for standing in front of an entire room of people looking at me while it's dead silent. Couple examples:

1. Gave a speech about boba tea in front of a class of about 30 students (could've been worse). Rambled for about 3 minutes about how a lot of people don't like it because of the sucking balls into your mouth part and the texture. Yea

2. Dad jokes. I wear glasses so I walked into a room to give a pitch and I said ""You know the great thing about being blind as a bat and having social anxiety? I can take my glasses off and it's like none of you are here"" and I took off my glasses and put them on the table and proceeded with my pitch.

I used to blush when talking to anyone.

gnfv1w,Tips on how to raise your GPA as an average student,"I technically made the dean's list this semester with a GPA of 3.55. I know for some it may not too high, but as someone who made a post at the end of last semester how to increase my pithy GPA of 2.98, it has been a good reminder that grades are not an accurate reflection of your self-worth.

This sub has helped me in the past, so I decided to make a post giving some personal suggestions and reflecting on some of the study habits that I adopted this semester.

&#x200B;

1. ***Make a planner or calendar*** with all the due dates from the syllabus. Update this as changes arise. I also make a breakdown of grades for each course.
2. ***Grind to score well in your first midterm or major assignments.*** They cover the basic topics in the course that later material builds on. My personal opinion is that it sets the expectations for both how you and the professor believe you are going to perform in the course. Furthermore, they are usually comparatively easier & therefore important for courses in which you can only drop 5-8% points to score an A.
3. Be that kid that ***speaks up in class***. Clearing up doubts as they arise is very important. You will not remember to look it up later. This will help the professor remember who you are (hint: professors like students that are interested in what they teach!)
4. ***Do the readings when they are assigned.***
5. ***Review what you do after each class***. Summarise by writing down notes or typing out the important points that you have learned in class (each time) using your own notes, lecture slides, book, handouts, and readings.

Ask your silly questions (if you still too shy to ask in a lecture setting) or ask for clarification on what the assignments are. Very important as soon as you feel like you are struggling. t is as simple as saying, that you feel like you are struggling or not doing well you had hoped.
7. ***Exploit the rubric***. For a majority of the assignments professors layout word-to-word an outline of what they expect from you in the rubric. Follow it!!

fz824q,I fell asleep in online class and two students went off on me. Is it their business?,"So essentially I fell asleep in my 10am camera class Saturdays on zoom while the mic was still on. I am in an ACTING CONSERVATORY/COLLEGE (I get some credits for it too yeah) I only kept the mic on thinking I would get called on and I heard him talking the whole time I was like half asleep. I’m surprised the professor didn’t mute me. Anyways during our 5 minute break (everyone turned the cams off, audio on). I woke up and this one girl went off on me about how I’m rude, I need to leave the chat ect. I apologized and said I won’t do it again my bad. And she continued to go on later once few people joined back. After this matter is it still her business to go off and keep talking about it?

UPDATE : 
She just tried throwing shots at me with another one of my “friends” in the comment section. I came off mute and said “it’s not ur fucking business, look btw sir I’m sorry for falling asleep it was uncalled for. I already just apologized to y’all earlier so quit (I was even going to email him!) Student 2 : well then don’t fall asleep in class “ Professor : it’s okay guys please let’s do this privately next time, thank god this isn’t recorded” Btw Thanks for advice everyone

I was like WTF? because I don't talk to anyone in the class and I knew i didn't cheat. So I said ok i will talk to you in the next class.

so in next class, me and this girl stay behind and the professor hands us our assignments. and they were exactly the same! Apparently she printed hers in the library before me and i guess she printed an extra, and i accidentally picked hers up and just saw the top and assumed it was mine lol.

But luckily, the assignment was two pages and I somehow took her first page but my second page.

erf74t,Don't get an animal you can't keep,"Former humane society volunteer/college student in college town.

No one dares to admit it, but college students are awful about abandoning animals. Many students graduate and move to new places that don't take animals so they ""just so happen"" to lose their animals and leave their cats and dogs behind as strays, especially cats.

If you live in your college town during the summer, you may notice that many stray cats pop up immediately after graduation or when leases tend to end. It's also seen somewhat in the shelters, too. 

Don't be an asshole. Animals are not a toy. If you adopt one, either keep it or hand it off to another responsible owner, but for the love of all things, don't just toss it on the street.",college,1295,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/erf74t/dont_get_an_animal_you_cant_keep/,False,USA,77,[deleted] ,2020-01-21 00:09:34
f5u8b0,i’m pregnant,"
I’m a pre med student and I very unexpectedly got pregnant. i use protection with my boyfriend but i guess the condom must’ve ripped. i grew up in a very pro life household and it’s stuck in my head that it’s morally wrong to get an abortion. i’m fine with other people taking that route and i was going to do it myself but i just can not do it. it hurts me so much. 
i’m about a month along and i’ve decided to let nature take its course and if it’ll be a miscarriage then that’s the way it’s supposed to be. 

i will be a sophomore when the baby is due. my family and my boyfriend’s family is very supportive and will help out. my grandma wants to move close to us just to be able to help us out so we can still continue with school. i’m planning to take a semester off or do online classes when the baby is due. do you guys think that having a kid will affect my chances of getting into medical school? will they see me any differently? thank you so much for the help. this has been a very rough couple of days for me.

EDIT: i appreciate all the support! it definitely has made more comfortable. i luckily went through a rough childhood to build up my maturity. my mom had cancer and i was the only one able to take care of her, had to skip a lot of high school and i still graduated with a 3.5 GPA all honors and AP classes. overall i missed 70 days sophomore year, almost 50 days junior year and  about 40 senior year. i genuinely believe i have the work ethic but i’m still nervous because i completely understand the responsibility. i’m very lucky to have two families and boyfriend that are willing to help with anything i need.",college,1287,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f5u8b0/im_pregnant/,False,USA,195,Pog ,2020-02-19 00:21:20

cpmtsi,"Dear Incoming Freshmen,","As the summer is winding down and you are getting ready to leave home and go off to your college of choice (if you haven’t already), this post is for you. 

Leaving for college is both a liberating and terrifying experience. You leave everything that you’ve ever known to go to this place to peruse a better life for yourself. While there is much honor in doing this, there is no doubt that you feel scared to leave the comfort of your parents home and the life that you have become accustomed to. You will be leaving your parents and your home (for those of you not commuting), your friends, your pets, your room, etc. You go to this new place with no idea what to expect and not knowing many people. Many college students have gone through this. 

As a sophomore, I will admit that I do not know everything that there is to no know about going away to college. However, I can say that I can offer pieces of advice. 

Going away to college is a big deal. It is a major transitional period in your life. Your parents know this, your professors know this. That being said, in your freshman year, professors and school officials do tend to be more lenient toward freshman because they are adjusting to the new lifestyle of living away from home and on their own. 

Once you move in to your new dorm, the reality of the situation will not begin to set in until your parents leave (If they helped you move in. I know that some kids drive themselves). Once they leave, take some time to unpack and organize your things. Then maybe take a walk around campus, either by yourself or with a roommate, to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and the layout of the campus. 

Don’t try to join too many clubs or organizations because if you do what I did, you try to sign up for as many things as possible. Please take into consideration that you are acclimating to this new lifestyle and don’t try to overwhelm yourself with unnecessary activities. You also need to make time to do everything, such as study and do your laundry. More power to those that can handle it all though.

Remember to be respectful of your roommate. You will share a room and maybe a bathroom with this person for the whole year. It is better to be at a good understanding of each other’s boundaries then to deal with the fallout from not doing so later. Also remember to set up those boundaries earlier. Your RAs will most likely encourage this. An RA told me something that I will never forget and its that you will not always be best friends with your roommate, sometimes you are just simply that; roommates. 

Keep your classes and classwork organized. You will save so much time not having to dig through piles of paper to find one assignment. Personally, I use separate binders for each class but that’s just me. 

Figure out a good sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it. Don’t wake up at staggered times and go to bed at staggered times. There were countless times that I would have an 12pm class as my first one that day and sleep until 11:30 and then not want to go to bed until 1 or 2 the following night before I had an 8am the next day. Sleep is more important than you think.

Always print things out in advance. You don’t want printer problems to screw you over 15 minutes before you have to turn it in. Print it out ASAP to save yourself some stress. 

Never feel pressured into partying. If you want to go to a party, then by all means go. If it is not your thing, then don’t go. Just make sure that it will not be an inconvenience to your schoolwork. It is okay to say no to going to a party. I know many, many people that made partying their first priority and they dropped out by the start of the second semester. It’s important to have a good balance between fun and work. 

Go to class!! Just go. You don’t want to miss one and be out of the loop and have no idea what’s going on. If you have to miss one because you are sick or there are family issues going on, email your teacher or ask classmates to catch you up, maybe even bring you a copy of class work. You have unlimited resources to keep you caught up. 

In regard to the above paragraph, you are allotted a certain amount of classes that you can miss before you fail. Do not abuse these because I guarantee you that there will come a day where you really wish that you had a freebie to use but you used them all in the first two months. Just keep a couple in the reserves and use them wisely. 

And last but not least, do what YOU want to do. Do what makes YOU happy and what you feel is best for yourself. Don’t do things you don’t want to do because your friends are doing them. Don’t do something that you don’t want to do because your parents are forcing you to. Do what makes YOU happy. And while you may feel pressured from all sides to do things that don’t make you happy, in the end is that really a way to live your life? Constantly bending over backwards for something you don’t like? Be yourself. Do what you love. Be happy. College only lasts for so long so enjoy the time that you have there. 

Sincerely, 
Your neighborhood sophomore

cug62h,A Former Student’s Top Tips for College,"As a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven’t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. 

1. Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. 

I would say I talked to about 50% of the people in my classes (about class size of 40) and got to know about 5 people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. 

2. Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. 

Put in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. 

3. Learn to read PDFs on your computer. 

I didn’t buy a college text book in 4 of the 5 years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still 95% the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. 

4. Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. 

Right before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board 

5. Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. 

Over the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. 


I hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!


Edit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn’t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.

So here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is 10 states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network.

d14j6d,"Hey, guys, use a railing.","You know that weird dream sensation where you're in and out of sleep, and you feel like you're falling then jerk awake when you land? Well, that happened to me this morning at 5 am, but I wasnt dreaming, and I woke up halfway between the mattress  and when I hit the floor. 

For reference, my bed is lofted more than 6 feet off the ground. I'm honestly lucky to be alive, and only sustaining ""minor"" injuries at that. Somehow I managed to land in one small area between multiple dangerous corners like my fridge and desk, and I didnt land on my head, but on my knees. My left knee took the full force of a 6 foot drop. It was busted open, and I believe I may have minor fractures in both knees. 

Moral of the story, please for the love of god use a rail; I know it's rare, so rare that the police officer that arrived at my dorm (after I called the police because I couldnt extend my legs) told me I was the first one he'd seen do this in his 35 years on campus.

Last week we had a computer science assignment due that we both forgot about until he looked at the course page and realized it was due at 11:59 which was in half in hour. We both busted our laptops out and wrote the code as fast as possible and finished around the same time... 12:01. frantic and not wanted to get stuck with a zero we both sent separate emails to our professor with the files attached. The fact that we did this assignment so quickly is an important detail to me because it means there is no way we could have worked together and still get done so fast. 

Fast forward to today, about a week later. This morning she replied to the email finally and asked us to come her at her office hours. my roommate had a class so I went alone. My professor accused me of plagiarism citing that our code was too similar, we made the same mistakes, and we both tried to turn them in late, around the same time. I tried fighting for my case but of course she was very dismissive and at one point laughed at me. She tried getting me to sign off on a paper that would be sent to the office of student conduct but I refused and wanted to consider my options before admitting to something I didn't do, so I have to go to her office hours again on Monday. and that brings us to right now. I don't know how to prove that I didn't cheat and I'm worried about suffering consequences that I don't deserve. Any advice would be much appreciated right now.

Semester is ending and you're about to move on and forget your current professors.  Somebody else still needs to take the course you you just finished.  Pass on what you learned.  

Use your school's feedback surveys (most schools push them or even require them). Use RateMyProfessor.  Just share your experience.  Did the professor torture you by treating their 3 credit humanities course like it was a 6 credit monster worth 30 hours per week?  Was you Bio professor awesome and deserves recognition?  


This matters.  When I go to register for classes, I check my professors ratings.  If there are 3 or less ratings, then it's useless to me.  I would rather take a 3.9 professor with 40 reviews than a 5.0 with 1 review.  You should all be checking these and leaving feedback afterwards. If you aren't reading any sort of reviews prior to registering, it's kinda your own fault when you are stuck with the most difficult professor on campus.

I have also used it on the six quizzes and two exams we have had right in front of her without a single issue. Until today mid way through the exam! 
I emailed her (kindly being mean or rude to a professor gets you nowhere) explaining the issue and how I felt that it was unfair to myself and that I would have not used it had I been told no when I asked, or told no on quizzes early on, or even a bit understanding if she said no on exam 1. If she basically tells me, “oh well guess you’re screwed” what should I do next?

dkb73c,My roommate rarely leaves the room,"So this is one of those complaints that really does get the response ""Suck it up, everyone gets bad roommates,"" but I'm about to lose my mind. I can generally handle roommates from hell. I'm a sophomore, I went to boarding school for 3 years and had roommates lock me out of the room for tinder hookups, hide drugs in my fridge, and was once roomed with someone who hated my guts, but I can't handle this. As it stands, I'm living in an 8x12 room with someone who hardly leaves. All of our classes are at the same times, so I can't even rely on time to myself while she's in class. She always eats in the room, either microwaving her food in her microwave, or only leaving for roughly 15 minutes to go pick it up and come back. I know the typical response is to just tune her out, but I also have ptsd and am hypervigilant and literally can't do that.

Honestly, if it was just her not leaving, I'd likely be fine, but she's also very controlling of the environment in the room. She always wants the lights off and the heat on. If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within 5 minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.

I'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for 6 hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.

Right now, I need some advice on just getting through this semester, since I can't get a room change until after winter break.",college,1037,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dkb73c/my_roommate_rarely_leaves_the_room/,False,,101,Mother should step up till winter break.. my child would not go through this for school.. ,2019-10-20 07:02:25
epjhi2,My roommate smells like literal death and it’s time to be mean about it,"I live I a frat. I joined spring and by the time I was initiated this kid was my only option for rooming. 

Last semester I spoke to him 3 times about his hygiene and how he smells. The first and second time I made sure to be very polite and not to hurt his feelings. He said he’d “take care of it” and just bought candles and febreez. The problem is his shower and laundry habits, which are essentially nonexistent. 

The third time I spoke to him I was really pissed off with him. I told him it was atrocious and I made him do his laundry, change his sheets, and shower. It was better for a week or two. 

Everyday I wake up and leave to brush my teeth. When I get back, there’s this overwhelming smell of a mix between feet, Asshole, and BO. I am sick of it. He’s lucky I don’t have a girlfriend anymore or else I would be a lot less patient. 

I think today I’m going to be brutally honest with him. Maybe even mean. I’m out of options here. My house eboard won’t get involved. All they will do “mediate a conversation” between the two of us. I can have a conversation on my own. This kid needs to be told that no one likes being near him because his stench is nauseating. 

Anyone got any tips or something? I’m at the end of the rope with this kid

cvt2xv,Strange for mom to sit in class?,"Hello /r/college,

My father passed away last Friday and it has been really hard on me. On top of already suffering from PTSD, it's definitely a really difficult time for me to get through. My mother offered to sit in class with me as support. Not chatting or anything, but her being near is the only time that I feel comfort. It feels like the only way I'll be able to get through the first few weeks of the semester without withdrawing.

Is it strange that I want this? The professors I have emailed so far seem to be fine with it. But I get the idea that people are probably going to look at me negatively.

Best wishes.

ebhjf0,Update to being accused of cheating on exam.,"Hello, yesterday I made a post about how I was accused of cheating on an exam because the student next to me and I had 94% the same answers on the exam.

I just got out of the meeting with the course coordinator and they said that the statistics don't lie and one of us, or both of us will be suspended from the course.

What does a suspension mean and what can I do to make my case stronger?

I did not cheat on this exam and cannot fathom the idea of losing all my grades, having to be suspended from the course and college, and losing all the money I put into the course and getting OSAP.

Can anyone give me advice or help me in any way?

Edit: Everyone keeps thinking I mean we both got 94% as a mark on the exam, this is not the case. We both got 94% THE SAME ANSWERS. Our mark on the exam was so ass I'd rather not share haha.

aa0w4d,Just a few things to consider while on break...,"\- REST DAMMIT. You need to actually sleep and take care of yourself. You were looking forward to this time, so you better take advantage of it. I know, you are only home for a limited time and you want to see all your friends. That's cool. But take some small time to actually take care of yourself.

\- If you are spending it at home, then please spend some time hanging out with your parents and family. If you got them nearby, go see your grandparents. Looking back, I wish I would have just spent a bit more time with my mom when I was home.

\- Check your grades. Celebrate, cry, ponder, but take a moment to really look at where you are and see if you are doing as you expect. Not liking your classes? Still want to major in that? Is this your 3rd time taking a course? Sit down and really evaluate where you are, and if you are taking the right steps to get to where you think you want to go.

\- Check on your funds. Those of you that are lucky to have your parents pay for your education, please do not take it for granted. If you know you are going to be short for the next semester, look at job options, loans, and any possible scholarships. Mapping out how much you are going to owe before you start can put you in a better position.

\- If you are considering not going back to school, like you are for sure not going back, TELL SOMEONE. You do not need a big fat bill showing up on your doorstep because you failed to withdraw the correct way. Tell admissions, tell a family member, and talk to someone. Do not assume that this will be taken care of.

\- If you are feeling down over break, find someone to talk to. Yes, it is okay to text a friend and say ""Hey, if you got a minute to talk or hang, I would really appreciate it. I am not doing well right now."" Reach out to people. Talk it out. Do not bottle things up. Help is out there.

\- If your graduation is in the upcoming year, or you know you are going to be doing a lot of interviews soon, make sure you got a professional sounding email and an updated resume.

d86kes,"Besides the extremely unfair cost of tuition, what aspect of college do you dislike the most?","For me, it's either the useless required courses that are not related to our majors or the lack of focus on teaching by professors.



At my school, a lot of teaching is done by part-time adjunct professors.  They are not industry professionals looking to teach the next generation of engineers, but mostly people working this job and applying for tenured track positions.  




A lot of the teaching is pretty generic, from information you can easily google, and read right off the powerpoint.  My largest criticism is that none of the professors try connecting the material to modern research, so the entire course feels like reading a bunch of wikipedia articles.  It makes it hard to network with tenured professors for research opportunities since they don't teach that many classes except for less than a handful of upper level electives.",college,961,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d86kes/besides_the_extremely_unfair_cost_of_tuition_what/,False,,451,"Honestly live lectures.

Due to COVID-19 my college has decided to move online for the remainder of the semester. Now I’m home all day since my job is also shut down for at least a month. My problem lies with my parents. They constantly argue which means I can’t focus on my school work. I always try to remind them that I’m studying, but that seems useless. 

My mom is currently still working away from home as of yet which means I do get some peace and quiet during the weekdays. My father usually keeps to himself during the day.

9f28m1,College Regrets,"Please read everything.

My biggest regret in life is cheating. I have cheated in every class in college. My mind was too preoccupied with wanting to finish school in 4 years, so I piled on classes every semester. I didnt study. I learned nothing. I would go into class with a game plan to cheat on exams. 

I majored in accounting, from my Accounting I class to the upper level bachelors classes, I cheated. I regret that so much. I have such little accounting knowledge. At work, my boss started asking me elementary accounting questions and I couldn't answer him. I was so embarrassed and I knew then that he regretted hiring me. 

I am typing this with embarrassment. I beg you to not cheat in college. I faked my way through everything. In 2 months I am starting a new job with a big company and I am so nervous. I don't have the knowledge to to the job, just the degree.

Unfortunately by then my financial aid was already affected but I’ll be sorting that out with them on Monday. Thanks everyone for your helpful responses, and happy new year. 



So this is going to be long but basically I took communications over last summer & due to a screw up with admissions I wasn’t able to enroll from the waitlist. My professor, being a nice guy, told me to just keep attending the class and then enroll next semester and he would put in my final grade at the end even though I would not have to attend. I ended up getting 100% in the class and had a really great time, prof is very chill and made the whole thing really fun for everyone. So flash forward to finals this semester and I’ve followed up with him multiple times to make sure he is going to enter my final grade (A), even though I have not been attending this semester per our agreement. He assures me every time that he will enter my grade and not to worry. We email back and forth maybe half a dozen times confirming it. I even go in on the last day to check in and make sure he remembers and he tells me I’m all good. So, finals end, and I don’t check my grades for a week or so because I’m busy with other things. I check my final grades two days ago to see he has given me an F. Panicking, I email him that there has been a mistake. No response. As a part time faculty member there is no contact information for him in the directory other than his email, and the campus is closed down for the holidays. I’m very stressed because I have never failed a class before and the F has effected my GPA drastically. If I am unable to contact him until some time has passed, will he still be able to fix my grade? It’s 2:24 am and I can’t sleep because I’m so worried that this won’t be able to be resolved and permanently damage my gpa.

gft0ne,13 minute finals,"Hey all. I seriously need feedback on this. For 2 of my classes with the same professor, our finals worth 40% of our grade will be online. 13 minutes, that's it. You don't get to see every single problem in one go - you can only see them as you take the exam (so you do question 1, then question 2, etc). So if you trip up on #1, you can't spend more time thinking. IDK how anyone can even \*think\* per question. There's 10 questions. They're multiple choice, true/false but half the questions are paragraphs long based on the midterm of the same format. (Not exaggerating, I saved the exam when I got my instant grade, and the ""10 questions"" were more than 3 pages single-spaced.) Prof. said finals is same thing so I'm going to be presumptuous and say we'll have paragraphs long questions on the 13-minute finals as well.

Is this even rational? When I took the midterm, I was 2 minutes in when my internet was \*\*\*\*\*\*\* up and then I lost 4 minutes to the exam. BAM, I failed the exam because I couldn't even get to question 5. How was I supposed to think through any of the questions when I have 4 minutes to do a bunch of other questions? The midterm average among 80 students was a 30/100. The professor \*graciously\* said our midterm can be worth nothing and our finals worth 40%, depending on how well we do. (Originally each was worth 20%.) Well, the finals is the same format, and I'm annoyed. I am more scared about my internet disconnecting than me not knowing the answer. I literally don't even want to start the exam because my internet hasn't been stable for the past 60 days, just like every other American. I can't even sit through a 50-minute Zoom without disconnecting every minute. What's up with this professor? I've raised this issue with her before, she either misinterpreted me or was a d\*\*\* and said, ""I can't just accommodate you or else I'll have to accommodate everyone else."" I'm baffled because I'm positive out of her 160 students total (in both classes), there's at least 50 of us going through hell.

Please let me know what you think - I'm seconds away from raising this to higher ups but I want some rationalization of why a final worth 40% with 10 questions only allows 13 minutes. If we could see all the questions at once, I would say it's a little bit ""better"" b/c we can do what we know and think about the hard ones last. But that's not the case. I don't even know how any of this is feasible when this reddit post absolutely undermines other factors of my life tht are f\*\*\*\*\* up such as having to be home 24/7 with an abusive family. This is ridiculous. Someone enlighten me. Let me know if you're confused on why I am complaining b/c I am thoroughly annoyed with my school and don't know how to write, talk, w/e. This is the 1,000,001th time I've complained in the last 60 days.

edit 5/19: thank you for everyone's comments! Wanted to say that I scored above the curve for both finals, so I should still be getting my A's at the end of all this. No - the 13 minutes never got changed. The finals did become 20% rather than 40% though. President, 2 deans, 4 chairs - nothing was done. I guess all of their brains think 13 minutes is right for a finals during a coronavirus pandemic. Absolutely outrageous but farewell to this pathetic school.

anbv6u,... How does college work?,"Perhaps this is better suited for /r/NoStupidQuestions , because seeing my peers all seemingly knowing exactly what they're doing has me terrified.

I'm a high school student, in my second semester of my junior year. I have a few universities in mind, but.... I just don't know what I'm doing, and it's leaving me very unsettled and insecure.

Once I apply for college, how do student loans work? Do I take multiple student loans for multiple years? Do I take one big student loan? When do I search for / apply for scholarships? I'm planning on getting a Master's degree (computer science). Is there a separate loan for that?

Once I finish my bachelor's degree and start working on a Master's, do I work at a job concurrently as I study for my Master's? Is a Master's like a bachelor's, where you go to classes (mostly) every day, or is it something different? Is my notion of how a bachelor's degree is obtained even correct?

Back to student loans, when do you have to start paying? What happens if you miss a payment?

d1kopy,Roommate refuses to lock the dorm door,"My roommate REFUSES to lock our dorm door, I’m a band member and own multiple instruments, an expensive computer, monitor, iPad and more. The other day I opened my door to find a person I had never seen before standing in the middle of my room, I said “hey man!” And the rando said “hey!” And bolted past me, out the door and down the hallway to the elevators. I told my roommate about this and he just says “he probably just had the wrong room” I have confronted my roommate 3 or 4 times and I told him he has to lock the door, today over snapchat this was his word for word message he sent “Dude I’ve already been here a year and me and my buddies know everyone on this floor nothings getting stolen bud. You can lock it that’s fine but I’m not going to” this got me absolutely fuming, I feel like I’m about to explode and I feel the moment he enters the room I’m going to go berserk. The RA has been gone for the past couple days including today so I have nobody to turn to. Any tips? On both calming me down and getting him to lock the door, I don’t feel like having to pay what would be equal to another year of college if my instruments get stolen, not to mention the sentimental value of them from the generations before me that passed them down.

Edit: is there anyway to get him kicked out of my room? If it helps, A few days I found his secret stash of Busch Light, and he vapes like crazy when I’m not around, when I go into the room from a day full of classes, it reeks like burning sugar.

Edit: I do have a description of the random who was in my room before and his shirt had a last name on the back I’ll definitely bring that up with my RA

Update: I have set an appointment with the RD today at noon, it is currently 10:00. At first they said he wasn’t available today, until I brought up that it was a security issue. They said it needs to get resolved immediately so they are making an exception. Wish me luck on making my case, I’ll update you guys on what happens

Update: my RD said that I need to file a police report and have the police talk to my roommate directly, also they are going to expedite the moving process and get him out of my room within a week, also spotted my RA at lunch and he said he is going to take care of it immediately.

Update: Police said they are going to talk to the RD to set up a talk to make sure he locks the door, in the meantime while they get the move paper work finalized.

dbbxxi,Got a 46/100 on my first exam that's related to my major..is it time to panic a little?,"Title pretty much says it all. I got a 46/100 on a biology exam. I didn't study as much as I needed to and I definitely need to change that because I don't want to feel this way again, but what else can I do to pull the grade up before the end of the semester?

And just to be clear I didn't come here looking for any sort of sympathy, I was just curious as to what advice others could give who knows what it's like to be in this position. I know that the only person that can pull the grade up is me and that I'll have to work for it which I am more than capable and more than ready to do.

gmtwfx,Am I wrong in thinking my professor went a little overboard?,"I am a first time college student in my first quarter. I am taking a statistics class which is pretty difficult. I understand the material decently well and manage to get 90-95 on my tests. For the midterm exam, I felt beyond stressed out because a lot of the questions were completely different from the material I had learned and I felt confused. I ended up getting a 65 on the exam. Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how “gracious” he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general. He basically was saying we were lucky he was being so kind and that if we were having a hard time now then we won’t be doing well in college. He called all of our complaints baseless. I felt berated. Even if he is right, I felt it was very unprofessional to write such a long and intense post directed at his students. Am I wrong or overreacting to this?

You probably didn’t learn the concepts and were not able to apply knowledge. College requires more than memorizing.  The prof was right to shut down the whining. It grows if ignored and hurts everyone’s learning environment. Students then feel entitled to always complain when their grades are not what they desire. If not shut down, they will do it to another prof and the whole atmosphere at the college becomes negative and students think complaining and pressuring get results they want. It can cross over into outright bullying and harassment of profs very quickly. The prof should not need to put up with such pressure from students. It’s fair and wise for the prof to expose the baselessness of the whining. You are not coddled in college. In stats, students need to be able to transfer concepts to new cases they have not seen and recognize what concepts to use to solve it. This tests if they actually learned anything.

gxp2fs,Is there any point for me to try to continue college with a 0.80 GPA? Is there even any possibility?,"To put it simply, my college career is completely screwed up. Over the last four years, I’ve taken four semesters of college (2 semesters in physical classes and a 2 semesters of online classes). Somehow, for no good reason other than lack of interest/drive to do the work, I’ve managed to fail nearly every single class I have attempted. At it’s lowest, my gpa was a 0.39. I took 3 classes online last summer in which I managed to achieve 2 Bs and an F. That brought my GPA up to 0.80 and I haven’t given it another run since. 

This is a very different picture than my academic profile in high school: 3.8 GPA, highest SAT score, National Merit Scholar, etc. Needless to say, I lost any and all scholarships I had.

I wish I had a better reason for why I’ve done so horribly in college. My father died shortly after I graduated high school, so I used that as an excuse in the mandatory meetings I had to have with advisors due to being on academic probation. But while that was definitely a very sad experience, I can’t honestly say I felt any depression or sadness that was impacting my desire to do school work.

The only real reason is that I have been spending my time working on other things, but I know this isn’t a solid justification as I know plenty of people who have excelled in college while working on other business and/or creative ventures on the side.

Now, as I watch all the people from my high school class graduating and getting their degrees, I can’t help but wonder if I should give another pass at this or throw in the towel. I haven’t officially thought of myself as a “college dropout” yet, but I also don’t have any concrete plans of returning.

Currently, I’m running a small video production company, learning a few instruments and DAW software in hopes of finding success (and skill lol) as a musician, and studying/practicing screenwriting with aspirations to write for (and one day create/executive produce) television shows. 

While I like to think I’m confident that I can realize my dreams without college, there are times where I can’t help but wonder if I need to give it another shot, just in case. I also feel like I’ve been socially cut off from people in my age group these last few years and worry that it’s negatively impacting my ability to make social connections that could be beneficial in my fields of interest. I’m an introvert so it can be difficult for me to actively place myself in social situations at times. College seems like a bit of an easier way to accomplish this. 

But then I think about how much of a waste of money and potentially time it could be and go back to square one.

I’m not sure what the point of this post is, I guess I just felt like ranting but also would be interested to hear other people’s perspective on if it is even worth trying to go back with my GPA where it is. If you actually read all of this I appreciate you!!

TL;DR: College GPA after 4 semesters is a 0.8. Is it even worth trying anymore?


Edit: WOW, this in-my-feelings rant got way more attention than I expected! I appreciate all of the responses, advice, words of inspiration, and reality checks. 

To everyone who suggested I pick up a trade - luckily I’ve managed to make a decently lucrative gig out of the video production thing so far. Had a full time job as video production specialist (ironically for a school district) for a couple of years that I recently quit in favor of doing my production company full time, so I’ve been fortunate enough to at least have that for the time being as an income source while I work on my other passions. 

If I went back to college now, it would likely be the same story. I will focus these next few years on trying on putting my time, money, and energy into the things I’m truly committed to and reassess college a few years down the line.

e6qouw,Would it be weird to give a campus store worker a Christmas gift?,"EDIT 2: May you stumble across this post at a later time, or if you were at all wondering how this turned out, I posted an update here: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ed27re/update_i_gave_the_older_man_who_works_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf 

There’s an older man who works in the campus store I frequent. He’s so friendly and bright all the time, and always greets me (and others, I presume) as “friend”, like “hi friend!” or “good to see you again friend!” It’s always very heartwarming.

Would it be weird to get him a gift, like a gift card? I don’t like giving gift cards, but I don’t know much about him and I feel like a gift card might make more sense in this situation. 

But would that be a weird thing to do? Should I just stick to a card, or would that be weird too? I’ve had a really, really rough time transitioning to college, but he’s basically always the positive interaction I can count on. Sometimes I don’t even really want anything from the store, but I’ll buy some candy just because he’s a nice guy.

EDIT: wasn’t expecting this many comments! (I realize there aren’t that many but... still). I think I’m gonna go with the idea of a mug filled with candy, although I’m really busy so I’ll just go with a small gift card for some coffee if I don’t have time before Christmas.

>  
>I suppose the obvious answer is ""just don't drink as much"" but now that that's covered I'm open to other ideas

Below is my answer to that redditor.  Please add any safety tips that you have regarding responsible use of alcohol.

>Welcome to your first (and hopefully only) bout of alcohol poisoning. That shit is deadly.  
>  
>**DO NOT DRINK SO MUCH.**  
>  
>First of all, if you're underage, don't drink. I have to say that, it's a sub rule to not engage in or advocate for illegal behavior.  
>  
>Second of all, assuming you are of age, control your consumption. That means a few things:  
>  
>1. Know how many drinks are in your cup. A filled 16 oz solo cup is 1.25 beers, 4 wines, and a deathsentence of liquor.  
>  
>2. Know that your body can only process 1 drink per hour. A drink is a beer, a glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor. *Pace yourself.*  
>  
>3. Keep track of how many drinks you've had and over what period of time. Look at your phone when you start drinking, else you'll have no idea when you started. Look at it every time you get a new drink, else you'll have no idea how much time has gone by. *Pace yourself.* **IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY DRINKS YOU'VE HAD, YOU'VE HAD TOO MANY AND IT'S TIME TO STOP.**  
>  
>4. The feeling of inebriation is, in my experience, a delayed effect. By the time you feel buzzed, if you're still drinking, you're going to get drunk. By the time you get drunk, if you're still drinking, you're going to get sick. *Pace yourself.*  
>  
>5. When you've had enough, and someone offers you another, for the love of God **SAY NO THANK YOU**. If you have to walk away from a game of beer pong, so be it. *Pace yourself.*

9hbtnj,"Early semester reminder: Stop having ""zero"" days","This borrows a quote from [ryans01](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/) but the idea has existed for much longer than that.

You're probably a couple weeks into the semester and you may be falling into the early semester trap. You find yourself in a period of time thinking ""Wow, I have no homework this weekend"" or ""Once I turn this in on Wednesday I'm free."" 

It's an illusion. In reality, you have more work to do; it's just not due until later.

Spend your free days getting started on that work. Even if just for a few hours. Don't have any more days of non-productivity. And by working, I mean really working. Not just staring at a textbook to kill an hour or going to class like you should already be doing, but actually spending Friday making headway on an assignment that's not due until next Wednesday, or getting caught up in a class where you know you're behind.

I give this advice for 3 reasons. 

\#1, A lot of college students (including myself for many years) miss points on assignments because they underestimate how much time it will take to complete. That's the dumbest reason ever to lose points. You're just hurting yourself for no reason.

\#2, Most students' schedules have a natural ebb and flow: crazy amounts of stress before deadlines, and free time elsewhere. It's not balanced nor healthy. It's the reason some students can't take the pressure when it really builds up. Delegate your work more evenly and you'll still have the ability to take time off and relax, just with less stress hanging over your head.

\#3, It builds discipline. You have to teach yourself to work even when you don't want to. That's the difference between discipline and motivation. Motivation is nice, but it won't last you all year long. Discipline will. 

I hope this is read by at least one person who can apply this to their situation.

8g8ukf,Remember to be grateful you get to go to college.,"I know it's kind of pop culture to complain about college, complain about finals, and even complain about school in general. 

But remember to acknowledge how lucky you are to be able to go to college to forward your thinking. The fact that so many of our generation go to college may seem bleak for job security, but remember how amazing it is that we are moving towards an educated society! 

I think back to every day people in the 1800's. There's a meme about a doctor telling someone they have ghost in their blood and to do cocaine. I know it's a joke, but that probably would have made sense to the average every day Joe in that time period. But the forwarding and plethora of educated people has eliminated many of these false understandings. (ex. What causes illness and how to cure it. Technological advancements, etc.)

Education also opens doors. I've met a few special individuals. One of which started out as just a poor black kid from a village in Africa. Through a Christian organization sponsoring him he was able to grow up healthy and educated, and eventually got to go to college. He ended up getting his masters in engineering. Now that poor village black kid makes a lot more money than I probably will and he used that money to help his family village and the Christian organization.

Just remember to pay thanks to the people who give us the privilege to go to college. Try to not take it for granted.

fpyhag,Coronavirus stimulus does not necessarily exclude college students. You might be able to get money.,"I have no legal background at all, but there is a lot of misconceptions going around about the package. That being said, even there is a chance that what I'm saying is incorrect, and if presented with new, correct, information, it will be edited.


**EDIT:** Same info, but more clarifications available at /r/taxes

https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/fq71lw/stimulus_check_faqs_3272020/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

**EDIT 2:** For those who are rightfully claimed as dependents, age 17-24, your parents will NOT receive a $500 bonus as you might expect. I urge you to email your senators and representatives, so this does not happen again in the future. I have personally emailed Jim Banks, Todd Young, and my representative in Indiana. Go on their websites, and use their contact forms. Reps and their office will actually read your email (this is their job and it helps their votes). You might think your one email or vote doesn't matter, but it does. It is better to do something than nothing in this scenario.

You may be able to benefit from the stimulus package depending on how you're supposed to file. There are many different news sources outlining the requirements. The absolute best way find out specific requirements would be to wade through the hundreds of pages the bill contains. I have tried, but failed to understand it.

As of now, the New York Times's FAQ has good answers: https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html
What is in the bill, is not a partisan issue. Please check multiple sources for the best information. My hope is that people who qualify for the money, will be able to get it, as I personally qualify as a independent filing college student.



**Bill Highlights From NYT**

""**How large would the payments be?**

Most adults would get $1,200, although some would get less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment would be an additional $500.""

**Comment**: This actually does exclude certain college students who are filed as dependents, as your parents won't receive an extra $500. It is under the assumption if your parents provide you with more than 50% of your finances, they will bail you out.

""**Do college students get anything?**

Not if anyone claims them as a dependent on a tax return. Usually, students under age 24 are dependents in the eyes of the taxing authorities **if a parent pays for at least half of their expenses.**""

**Comment:** If your parents do not pay for at least half of your expenses/aid you with financial needs, do not allow them to claim you as a dependent. It is a very common practice for parents to claim you as a dependent, even when they should not. It is my understanding that some parents who do not provide financially for their children will do this so they can get much more money. Doing so is tax fraud. 

The net gain of them for them claiming you as a dependent through tax credit is often much higher than you would get by filing independently. So, if you have a good relationship with your parents, and they support you, do not file as independent. 

You ay also able to change filing statuses from previous years. FAFSA usually considers you as a dependent in terms of financial aid even if you file as independent with the IRS. This does not disqualify you as long as you file independent with the IRS. For example, I am estranged from my parent, file independent with the IRS, but I still have to submit my parent's taxes for FAFSA.

""**What year’s income should I be looking at?**

2019, if you haven’t prepared a tax return yet, you can use your 2018 return. 

**Comment**: Many sources say 2019 first, and then 2018 if you don't have a 2019.

""**What if my recent income made me ineligible, but I anticipate being eligible because of a loss of income in 2020? Do I get a payment?**

The bill does not help people in that circumstance now, but you may benefit once you file your 2020 taxes. That’s because the payment is technically an advance on a tax credit that is available for the entire year. So it will depend on how much you earn.""

**Comment**: This may be useful info for students who graduated in 2019 and work full-time. Unfortunately, you won't get the check now, but at least you still get it.

b1sq05,Someone in my College made a petition to suspend everyone who has been accused of sexual misconduct,"A girl in our second year accused someone, but the legal system will take 6 months. So she started this petition, with the goal of getting everyone accused suspended until a verdict is reached. It seems mainly geared towards this one guy, but the title and text still call for all suspects to be suspended.


In the groupchat of my year people are angry, calling for suspension even though no proof has been shown yet. People seem to have done away with the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty'. I want to support victims, but this just seems crazy!


On top of that, one of my best friends had also been falsely accused by a different girl (weeks before). He is having a breakdown, his depression making a swift comeback because of the accusation. I truly believe he is innocent, they hooked up multiple times, she was sober and they even showered together. But she had a boyfriend, as he found out later, so possibly she didn't want to own up to it. He has moved out of our building already on request on the uni, but still studies with us.


What can I do to ensure people aren't getting suspended based on accusations alone? Is a petition like this even legal? I am personally rather upset by the amount of ire this has elicited. When I defended maybe not punishing someone without evidence I got some angry comments thrown my way.

EDIT: I want to put this into perspective, there is no physical protests or anything going on, just discussions in the groupchat. However, the petition now has 681 signatures. I assume most of them are just out of solidarity, but the title of the petition is ''MY UNIVERSITY to Suspend Suspects of Sexual Crimes from Education'' so it isn't exactly covert in its intentions.

agpb2s,PSA to all students (specifically freshman),"STOP PACKING YOUR STUFF EARLY!

It's extremely rude to start shuffling papers, zipping up your bags, and chatting to your neighbor with 5-10 minutes left of class while the prof is still talking. Especially when it's a big lecture hall, it's very hard to hear for students around you.

I say specifically freshman because I'm in 3rd year and people still do it in my programs, but it's the odd couple first year classes I have that are the worst.

Just wait till the end of class. If you are really in a hurry then arrange yourself so that when the prof is finished speaking, it's easy to pack your things and leave.

Edit: If you must leave early to not be late for your next class then so be it. But have some sort of exit strategy, keep your bag unzipped till you leave the classroom, sit as close to a door as possible, generally don't make a ruckus. My post was more aimed at the cumulative effect of the whole class who think packing up and chatting before the prof is finished is acceptable. The odd few people who must leave early can very well do so in manner that doesn't disrupt anyone and that is totally fine.",college,847,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/agpb2s/psa_to_all_students_specifically_freshman/,False,,84,"I’m paying 10k a year, I’ll stack my papers if I want to.

a5n0am,Professor was late to a final and said it was our fault,"Hey I’m not sure where to post this but I’m kind of at a lost for what to do. It’s currently finals week as many of you know and I have been studying my ass off. Today I had a midterm for my psych class that was set to be at 3:30pm, I know this because on the online finals schedule that every professor follows it stated 3:30pm was the time of the final. So me along with a majority of my classmates show up at 3:30 and waited but my professor failed to show. We spoke to the head of the department and they informed us that if the teacher does not show in the next 30 minutes then we were legally(?) exempt from the exam. Every person that showed up signed their name on a piece of loose leaf as proof of their attendance, we then brought the paper to the head of the department to get it signed. We emailed the teacher a picture of the attendance sheet and a small paragraph explaining that we showed and she failed to show up on time so we were directed to leave. Anyways, 4:30 rolls around and we get an email from the professor saying that the exam was actually at 4:30 and she stated this in class last week and since we were not there for the exam we would all have to reschedule it and take it with a proctor on another day. Now this is where I’m at a loss because there was no follow up email or anything other then her ALLEGEDLY (i’m emphasizing this because if she stated it I’m sure no one would of showed up at 3:30)  stating last week in class that it was moved to 4:30. Is this something that is allowed??? Correct me if I’m wrong but I think this is extremely unfair to everyone. Does anyone have any experience with this or know of what I should do?? 

Update: I couldn’t make it to the school because something came up (I had no final scheduled for today so my mom asked me to go with her to the doctor). However I did email the dean about the situation as well as my professor asking when I could reschedule the test because at this point fuck it I’m just going to take it and I know I’ll get a good grade on it anyways because I’ve studied a hell of a lot. Anyways, back to the stuff you guys care about- no one has responded to my emails. I sent both emails out at around 9am and I’m still waiting to hear back. Seems like I’m not much of a priority 🤷🏻‍♀️

New update: my professor emailed me back and my new test date is Monday at 11. I also still haven’t heard back from anyone else so that’s disappointing.

f6alhu,Should I/ how should I tell my roommate that I no longer want to live with him again next year.,"I'm a sophomore in college. At the end of my freshman year, me and a friend I met in my dorm decided to live together in an on campus apartment for this school year. Around the middle of this most recent fall semester, we both signed leases at the same off campus apartment complex with the understanding that we would be roommates. I did this because the complex I wanted to live in said that there were limited spots left (I know that there were probably plenty in hindsight) and I didn't want to live with strangers so I signed before really knowing what living with him entailed. It was mainly me that convinced him to live at this specific complex.

Now that we're about half way through the spring semester, the thought of living with him for another year makes me want to gouge my eyes out. He's very smart but he isn't modest about it at all, and constantly tries to flex how good he does in class or how easy he thought tests/quizzes were. It honestly feels like this is negatively impacting my mental health since we're in the same classes and I don't do as well as him sometimes. One time last semester when we were both studying for Organic Chemistry separately in our rooms, he walked into my room, looked at the problem I was working on, and just said ""wrong"". He also doesn't wash the dishes that he's used (all the dishes in the apartment are mine) until they are all dirty, usually leaving me with nothing to use, and when he finally cleans them, he never puts them away once they're dry unless I explicitly ask him to. He never takes the trash out unless it is stacked up to twice the height of the trash can (for this reason I only use the trash in my room now). FINALLY he never shaves his fucking pubes and they get all over the bathroom floor, and he NEVER cleans them unless I physically hand him the broom and tell him that I am not going to sweep his fucking pubes.

So, would I be an asshole for essentially leaving him roommate-less in an apartment complex that I convinced him to sign at? It's still a really nice place and really close to campus.

dua671,Lying to my parents about grades and major,"Hey guys,

So I have been facing tremendous depression and anxiety problems for the past couple of months due to hiding and lying to my parents about my college major. My university is one the best in the world for its computer science program and little did I know it's extremely competitive to get into the core program. In my first year I began my journey in computer science thinking I had to maintain a 60% in my courses to graduate. However, my school requires it's students to apply at the end of the first year to be admitted in the actual Cs major. Meaning there are internal requirements I must meet in order to get into CS. Some include a minimum gpa of 3.3/4.0 and mid 80s in my first year courses. I didn't get in my first year, so I tried again in second year and again failed to get a high mark good enough for a CS major. In my third year right now battling tremendous depression and anxiety because cs has always been my dream major. My parents think I am in cs and have good grades which I don't. I have been lying to them and forging my transcript everytime they see my marks and I am honestly exhausted. I have lost my appetite, lost roughly 8kgs and now have insomnia problems, diarrhea and other health issues. My mom's mental health is not stable to handle this and my dad has been juggling work and taking care of me and mom. I feel like a total scum for lying to them.

**FAQ About Friends in College**


**What should I do when I arrive on college to meet people**

Okay so the first week on campus- especially in the dorms- there is a bit of magic in the air. Everyone is nervous and while some people may have friends from highschool or from their childhood- pretty much everyone is looking to make friends. Take advantage of this!!!!

* Be friendly and talk with people on your floor and in your building. Introduce yourself. Say your major, where you're from, what hobbies you have, etc. Its all small-talk but later on when you see them in the hall it will be easier to strike up conversation 

* Take Initiative. Instead of just saying hi to people- invite some people out to dinner. Or be that one person that organizes dinner with the entire floor (its not weird. Its college. Just fucking do it). If large groups scare you- find a few friendly faces on your floor and ask if they're up for dinner- or going to that cool, definitely not lame freshman event on campus. Or ask if someone wants to go watch the opening football game with you. Or ask if they just want to explore campus. It may be awkward asking people you don't know- but it will be worth it as the friendships grow stronger. 

* Keep your door open. Even if you don't take initiative other people probably will. But if you stay locked up in your room all day then no one will know you're there and you will feel left out. Keep the door open and I promise you there's a good chance you'll just get invited places. Even if you keep your door open don't just stay in your room staring at the wall. Go to the common areas- if you see people socializing just go them. Its not awkward. Its college. Just walk up and say ""Hi I'm chevy- where are you guys from"" or literally anything no one cares. You might meet some cool people, you might not. Might make some friends this way, might not. Still worth a shot. I made some of my friends in college the first week by just randomly talking about anime and CS with strangers- anything can happen. 

* Always say yes. If someone asks you to go to some random book event in the campus center SAY YES. When you start saying no and stop saying yes people will stop asking you to go places. You know all those lame sounding events in the dorms? Yeah no one really goes to them because they care about face painting. They go to meet people. Put yourself out there and don't reject opportunities to meet people

**What if I go to a commuter campus, community college, or live off campus?**

Not to worry my friend. Remember there are people in your shoes too and they want to make friends as well. 

The main advice I would give for people in this situation is to try and stay on campus as much as you can. If you are a commuter student- don't just head home after class. Stay on campus! Engage in any club activities and set your study schedule around these activities. Or get a job on campus. Or just study at the library on campus or wherever! Its hard to make friends when you're never at school. 

Also try talking to a lot of people in your classes. Obviously don't disrupt actual class time- but asking people in your classes if they want to study together or even just saying hi can start friendships. Don't be shy! 

**Its after the first week of school and I still have no friends. What can I do?** 

There are many things you can do! Here are some suggestions: 

* Talk to people in classes. Since class is well underway- you can talk to people in class about current assignments, upcoming assignments, upcoming tests, etc. Its not weird- its college. People are nice! If it is farther in the semester you can ask someone if they want to work on an assignment together or study together. I've never been told no when I asked someone- you typically learn better when you work together anyways!!

* Join a club on campus. Its easier to meet people when you share a common interest- and if you join the hiking club because you like hiking then surely you'll meet people there who also like hiking. Now you have a conversation topic of ""hiking"" you can talk to them about. Yay! If you have no interests you can always just join a club related to your major or career goals and socialize with people there (but if you join the club for your major you can't use the famous 'what's your major' question when first meeting someone). You can also join clubs if you have no knowledge of them and are potentially looking at a new hobby. 
In any case- clubs typically advertise to (mainly) freshmen at the start of each semester- so if your school has an area where the clubs set up little information booths like my school did- just go and talk to some members and get a vibe for the club. If the people seem cool- just join and hope for the best! 


* Get a job on campus. I know, it sounds crazy. But a lot of jobs in college are social and I know I personally made a lot of friends through my job. Even the people working in the dishroom at the dining halls in my school typically talk to each other and work shifts with each other frequently- so its a great way to meet coworkers. And there's never a chance you'll run out of things to talk about at your job because worst case scenario just complain about how working sucks and everyone will agree with you! Win-win. 

* If you live in a dorm: Talk to people!!! A lot of freshmen take the same classes. If you see someone in a study lounge (or similar) and they are working on an assignment for your class- there's no harm in asking them if they want to study with you! Or if you recognize someone in your building from one of your classes you can literally just be like ""Oh hey aren't you in Accounting 101?"". Then you can progress the conversation into asking them if they want to work on class stuff together- and if they live in the same building it'd be super easy to do so!


* Partake in random activities! At my school a lot of people would play pool/ping pong in the dorms and a lot of people would just ask to play or jump in and I got to meet some people that way. Or people play Frisbee outside, or random other games. Its not weird to ask someone if you can play- I promise you. Worst they can say is no- best they can say is yes and you end up with new friends (and have a cool game to play with them too!). 


* Go to parties/other social events. You don't have to drink/smoke/do anything you don't like. Parties have lots of people and its a very social setting- so obviously the potential to meet people there is possible. Even if you're awkward or introverted- plenty of people like that go to parties too. There are also just random events happening daily on campus- all of them can be good ways to find people to talk to!

**I am a sophomore/junior/senior/ and have no friends can I still make friends?** 

Of course. People are looking to make friends no matter what year they are. I made new friends every year I attended college- people do not just stick with who they met freshman year. 

**I don't like my friends, what do I do? Am I stuck with them?**
No, Silly. You can always get new friends. If you don't like your current friendgroup- make sure you don't spend all your time with them. Try to branch out by meeting new people in classes, joining a club, getting a new job on campus, etc. Eventually when you make new friends- you can leave your old friends behind. There are other tips earlier in the guide- you can always follow those if you relied a bit too much on the dorm magic to make your freshman friends!

**Do all your close friends come from freshman year?**

No. While its easier for friendships to become stronger if they start freshman year because you have 4 years to develop a strong bond with someone- close friends come from any year. The person I lived with for a few years I met freshman year- but the person I would call my closest friend I met my sophomore year in college. Some of the closest people that I remain in contact with after graduation I only met late Junior year or even senior year of college. You can make close friends any year- you never know who you may end up meeting!

**Am I the only one that feels so lonely?** 

No. 

Like I said- it is the most common topic on our sub. Lots of college students struggle with the adjustment. You are not alone. Stay strong and try to follow the tips I outlined in the rest of this little guide to make some friends. If you put in the effort I would find it very difficult to believe that you can't make a single good friend. 


**Still having trouble making friends?**


**RELAX**. Making friends takes time and effort. You cannot expect to make close friends immediately. Continue being yourself and you will find friends eventually. No one likes someone who is miserable because they feel alone. Remain positive and remember that there are other people in your shoes too. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely in college, I'm sure most people on this sub have experienced it at one point or another. Keep doing you, take a deep breath, and enjoy college! The 4 years fly by quick. 


**Is there anything I should avoid to increase my potential to make new friends?**


*Yes*: 

* Avoid staying in your room all day. You cannot make friends if you hide from people 

* Avoid not talking to people. You cannot make friends if you are silent. I know I am a very quiet person but if I can force myself to talk to new people you can too. 

* Avoid remaining comfortable. Those 2 friends from highschool that came with you to college? Don't spend all your time with them. Branch out. Meet new people. Step out of your comfort zone. 


* Avoid not showering. If you smell bad people are less likely to talk to you 

* Avoid posting on this sub about not making friends. This won't help you make friends. Get off reddit and talk to real people instead. We can be your friends too but it probably won't replace the loneliness you feel in real life.

ekfbwy,Should I tell my professor I'm homeless?,"I'm taking a winter class online to boost my GPA so I can graduate. I am completely homeless and am working whatever jobs I can find while taking this class. All my savings were used to pay for class(in fall). I am wondering if it is a good idea to tell the professor my situation?

Edit: He didn't respond or seem to care.",college,833,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ekfbwy/should_i_tell_my_professor_im_homeless/,False,,80,"In general, you do not want to tell people you're homeless just to elicit sympathy.

If you have specific needs, then you might want to discuss it with your professor. For example, let's say your professor normally assigns homework Tuesday evening and expects it done Wednesday morning. You could go to them and explain that your only access to computers is during daylight hours at the library, so the schedule doesn't work for you - for example, if you could get the homework early, you'd be willing to turn it early.

However, 'homelessness' isn't really a disability he can accommodate. While homelessness does cause stress, it doesn't inherently interfere with your studies. Indeed, a fair number of homeless people specifically go back to school because it's something useful they can do to reconnect into society while still being homeless.

Also, you mentioned using your savings. If you're homeless, you should also certainly qualify for Pell Grants and subsidized loans. While this can impose certain requirements on the rate at which you take classes, you should maximize your use of these sources before you raid your other funds. ",2020-01-06 00:41:08

I understand a lot of the complaints I will layout seem egregious, or even ridiculous, but I have the mindset that no I will go to great lengths not to inconvenience others and I wish to be treated in at least a similar manner. 

For example, he will often play music or watch videos from his speakers when he has not only earbuds but headphones as well. My headphones aren't great, and I can often hear whatever he is listening too unless I put my own pair on and even then it's not enough. I rarely use speakers, and only ever when the room is vacant. I do this to ensure that others in whichever room I am in, whether it's my dorm or a public location, aren't forced to listen to what I want or cover their ears. 

That entire thing is more of an irritant than anything else, and while there are a few other things he does that cause annoyance (not showering often, not cleaning his half of the room, never doing the trash etc.), I recognize that no-one is going to be perfect and there are certainly much worse behaviors a room-mate could partake in. To deal with much of this, I have begun to do the majority of my studying in vacant classrooms. Furthermore, I almost never come back to the dorm unless absolutely necessary. I'm more of an academic in the sense that I really care about my scholarly work and grades, while he has admitted to me that he really has no goal in college. This establishes that we have fundamentally different objectives in college. 

However, the activity that I have suffered from the most recently seems to cross the line in my opinion, and I'm looking for feedback as my thinking may not be entirely coherent after only 6 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours. I have issues falling asleep (no diagnosis but I reckon I could get it if I discussed it with doctor and psychologist). He has friends from his home country that he enjoys to play online games with, and voice chats with them while he plays. I have no issue with this, a matter of fact I often do myself when I have spare time and my own room (similar train of thought to playing music/videos through speakers with other people around). He does this in our dorm room, which I personally don't enjoy but can tolerate to a degree. There are two major caveats though to this; the first of those being he will play late into the night consistently. The other is that he mostly plays FPS games, and not to stereotype but he often verbally expresses his frustration and sometimes very loudly. 

Storytime (Whoever comments ""Storytime"" first I will guild as a reward for reading this far. Seriously, thank you for reading): This week I had 2 midterms. The first of them was yesterday, and the second was today. The night prior to the first, he wasn't voice chatting but was playing an FPS game. At about 11:30p I turn off the lights as per usual on weeknights, and prior to this, I let him know about my midterms and that I would need to get sleep. He plays with his back to my bed, so the screen is facing me and practically blinds me, so I have to sleep on my left side which is difficult as I am used to the right (idk why, I just am). Not a big deal in itself, but the monitor lights up the wall to my left so there is practically nothing dark in the room unless I cover myself in the blanket, which makes it harder to breathe but at least it's dark. Furthermore, he plays with KBM (Keyboard and Mouse) and while his keyboard is supposedly ""silent"", it's not even close and I can hear it clear as day even when I cover my ears with multiple pillows under the aforementioned blanket. I even had tried putting on my headphones with noise-canceling with nothing playing, and turning my fan on max for white noise and I can still hear not only that, but the rapid clicking of the mouse as well. The cherry on top being when he gets frustrated, he often will speak about as loud as if I was trying to talk to someone across a crowded lunch table. Perhaps not for you dear reader, but for me, it is impossible to sleep when someone shouts various things like ""gay little f** stop camping with the (insert weapon here)!"" or ""That's right you little s***head.""
After asking him to quiet down a little at around 1am (I had been lying in bed on my left side, my blanket and 2 pillows over my ears for an hour and a half at this point) I was miraculously able to fall asleep at around 1:30am or so and get about 5 hours of sleep, along with 15mg of Melatonin. 

Yesterday, after my first midterm, I reminded him that I have my next midterm the following day and again will be going to bed at 11:30p. This time though, in addition to everything he did the previous night, he started voice-chatting his friend and playing games at 9p or so and continued it into the night. At around 12:30a I asked him to quiet down and he said ""Ok"" (He was almost shouting it was so loud). Yet he continues to voice chat, and I cannot fall asleep. I finally muster the courage at around **2:30a** and tell him ""Hey _____, it's literally 2:30a and I have a midterm in just over 5 hours. I am unable to get any sleep right now due to how loud that game is, can you please stop talking?"" I knew the clicking and typing would be somewhat loud, but better than the noise from speaking at least. He said ""Ok"" and **continued to play the game for another 45 minutes**. At the end of his call (I still can't sleep), he told his friend he was going to ""turn off the game because I am inconveniencing my roommate"" which I thought was passive aggressive but I was so tired idek. Either way, it was around 3:30a by the time the laptop and call were shutdown, and the room went dark. 

I slowly, without him noticing, stick my head outside of the oven that is under my blanket to enjoy the dark room when all of a sudden it lights up again! He literally pulled out his phone and started to listen to videos ***through the fucking speakers***. I lose it, because I know there's not a chance I'll fall asleep. I get up without saying a word, put on normal clothes, grab my alarm clock and blanket along with backpack with school supplies, and walk to the class where my midterm is going to be in about 4 hours from that time. I arrive in about 15 mins, and probably fall asleep around 5:30a on the hard-tile floor right next to the door to the classroom.

I've read other stories online, and to me this seems to cross a line. I understand that I'm not the only one living in the room and that I need to be empathetic to his wishes as well, but I absolutely need my sleep before a midterm and I feel as if it's non-negotiable. His lack of support or understanding to me seems entirely apathetic, perhaps even failing to understand why sleep is so important to me before a test (again, he has admitted he doesn't care much at all for academia). I have considered that since he and I were both raised in very different areas that perhaps the customs we were ingrained with are contrasted heavily, and I really want to see the good side of him and ensure that my mind isn't just making him a scapegoat here for my personal issues, hence this thread. If you read this far, thank you so very much and I hope this was somewhat entertaining. All I ask for is advice or just your opinion on the matter. Am I absolutely crazy? Again, only a few hours of sleep in the last 60 hours and I don't function well on low sleep, so if I'm bats*** crazy right now just give it to me straight.

**TL;DR- Roommate partakes in activities late into the night that prevent me from sleeping, and last night continued to do so after I asked him to be quiet multiple times. As a result I walked across campus around 5a to sleep outside the class I had a midterm at 8a. Am I crazy for thinking his behavior is unacceptable?**

Edit 2: 25 minute nap and rip inbox. Thank you very much for all the comments, it means a lot and I read each of them. I have decided to purchase some triple-flange silicone earplugs and a sleep mask, and will have a talk with roommate when he gets back tonight and tell him that after 11:30p on school-nights or unless agreed upon, lights are out in the room and any games will be played outside. If he doesn't agree, or fails to adhere, I'll go to the RA and post an update asking for more advice. Once again, thank you for all the replies it means the world to me.

cuvq3q,I miss being around people of color (I know it sounds dumb).,"I’m an 18 year old white guy and just moved into college.

I went to an elementary school next door to an apartment complex for first-generation immigrants, so all my life I’ve been around people of different colors, religions, and financial backgrounds. Here it feels like everyone’s a clone of each other. And I can’t help but compare myself to other people. I miss the diversity of my middle and high school campus.

cwcclc,One of my roommates is obsessed with me.,"There’s a multitude of examples I can provide, but I’ll just present the noteworthy ones. I’ve caught him multiple times watching me get dressed, usually followed up with a compliment on how nice my body is. If I say, “I’m going to go eat” he’ll be like, “Yeah, it’s been like... an hour. Gotta eat and get that protein.” He bases when he eats around when I eat, when I go the the gym around where he goes, and most of his other daily activities. He’ll text me everyday asking where I am and what I’m doing, and will talk roughly every 2 days about us rooming together after this year (it’s been less than two weeks).All this considered, I’m done with this hall. The option to switch rooms just opened and I wanna know if I should take it.",college,797,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cwcclc/one_of_my_roommates_is_obsessed_with_me/,False,USA,96,"I’m assuming you’re a freshman and y’all just moved in. 

I think that ‘clingy’ behavior is somewhat common. He’s in a new environment, desperate to make friends, nervous about going into any vaguely social situation solo. He sees you as the roommate he has the most in common with. 

If you are freshman, I’d give it some time before considering moving rooms just because it’s a pain. Likely, he’ll meet other people, make some friends who are glad to have him tag along- plus y’all are going to fall into daily routines and homework will pick up. 

In the meantime, I’d just try and shake him. You can be sneaky about it- casually ask him what his class schedule is while your on your phone and copy it down into your notes. Try going to the gym when he has class and you don’t- go straight from class to get food etc. hang out in your friends room. Or maybe you want to just have some alone time in your room while he’s gone and then dip before he gets back. Just be strategic with carving out some alone time and space for yourself. I think that’ll force him to put himself out there a bit too- he’s gotta eat so if he’s gotta go alone and sit with the people down the hall so be it. Heck, he might find he gets on really great with them. You can help speed up the process by doing this. And you can take back control of when you spend time with him by being the one who invites him along- set  new precedent that you’ll be the one who asks if he wants to join you when  you decide you want company. It’s also fine to be direct and just tell him “nothing personal, but I’ve been around a lot of people today and just want some time to myself” 

Also if the compliments about your body make you uncomfortable just say something. Like “thanks for the compliment. But I do feel a little weird with you watching me change.” You can play it off in a teasing  tone- but bring his awareness to how weird that is and he’ll be embarrassed and avoid it in the future. I think he is just trying to flatter you- from the situation it sounds more like he looks up to you than he is interested in you. 

All that being said, if this behavior persists and it turns out it’s just his personality and not him being nervous about starting college- absolutely move rooms. If you talk to the right person about how you’re roommate is making you feel unsafe and uncomfortable in your own space, you know play it up some- they’ll find you another room. You can’t just switch rooms because yours is too small or your roommate is messy etc.-but if there is some psychological harm going on- be it your being bullied, obsessed over, getting unwanted sexual attention etc. they have to move you. It might take them a little bit to shuffle things around or find an opening, but you can move rooms any time of year when you’ve got a legitimate reason like that. And if it does get to that point, I’d start keeping track of the incidents so you’ve got specific details to support your story. Also, bypass the RA in such a situation and talk to the head person for your hall. RAs are trained to solve conflicts and use moving rooms as a last resort. ",2019-08-28 07:20:00

ebyoa7,Writing Prof Here Again: Some Notes On Asking For A Grade Bump,"Obviously your mileage is going to vary. Every professor is different.

First, I'll start with why I might give someone a higher grade, and there's really only two reasons:

(1) I fat fingered something and typed in the wrong grade somewhere.

(2) The final grade does not fairly reflect the student's ability at the end of the semester. Basically, some students may have done really poorly on an early assignment (I teach mostly freshmen), and then they get their bearings later on. I usually only really care when I have a student who is on the bubble -- it takes a C to pass, so I carefully look at the C- students to see if this is the case for anyone.

Other professors may be more open to adjustments, so here's some things to keep in mind when you approach them about this:

--We've already ""reconsidered"" your grade. We're aware of what we're putting in, and we know that a 79.4 is only 0.6 points away from a B-.

--Why you want a higher grade isn't very important. Need to keep financial aid? Want to transfer? Headed to grad school? Parents will be mad? You're personally disappointed? Why you *want* the grade isn't nearly as important as why you *deserve* it.

--Once submitted to the registrar's office, grades may be very hard for us to change. For me, I have to get the head of my program and the dean to sign off on it, then go down to the registrar, wait in line, and give the business to the clowns who didn't process the request. Ain't nobody got time for that.

--The most important thing is to have a clear reason why you believe your body of work in the class means you deserve a higher grade. Correcting shortcomings from earlier in the semester is a decent reason. Committing to do better is not.

""I'm 0.5 points from a B-, and failed quiz #2, but got a B+ on the midterm which was cumulative and covered the quiz #2 material."" That's a decent reason for adjusting a grade.

""I slacked off earlier in the semester and got a lot of Ds and C-s, but you can tell from my Cs and C+s that I really committed to doing better. Also I worked super duper hard on the final essay."" Move along, move along.

--Don't try to flatter us. Everyone tries it, no one succeeds, and we can tell from your grades whether your claims about ""really learning a lot this semester"" are true. And, if you're grade grubbing, odds are our opinions about whether you really did learn a lot differ.

If you can *demonstrate* that you learned a lot though, that matters. ""I did poorly on essay #1 because I didn't have a clear thesis statement, but you can see from the organization in essay #3 that I took your criticism to heart and learned from it"" might do well.

e8de05,My parents are giving me so much shit for dropping out of college and doing something else. How do I deal with it?,"So college wasn't for me. I ended never showing up to class, didnt really care if I failed a test or project. Honestly, it never phased me because I just had no motivation or desire to be there.I would just work. Took me like 3 years to realize I didn't have to do what my parents told me too. Though part of the problem, I think, is that I stayed in my hometown for college. Saved money but still have like $30k in debt, but I digress. 


So I ended dropping out my junior year, crazy I know. But I was miserable. I couldn't take it anymore. My parents were pissed and dissapointed. I ended up joing the Marine Corps as an aircraft mechanic. Best job in the Marine Corps Btw.


Yeah, I dont make a lot of money. But I'm finally happy. I'm confident in myself and just feel great. I wake up WANTING to go to work even if it's only 4 am. I've made the best friends I've ever had and people I can count on.


The issue is, my parents dont even talk to me anymore. It's been like 4 months since I last went home didn't feel welcome. My little brother was the only one I can still bond with.

""Before reaching out, I expect you to put effort into answering your own questions. When you ask me a question, I will ask you to show me what you've already done to find the answer, and if it's clear that you haven't read the course notes or the provided readings, you will need 
to do that before we revist.

Not hearing back from me (such as having a question on an assignment) is not an excuse for not being able to turn the assignment in on time. Everything should be clearly explained in the assignments section of Canvas, including what format to submit your assignment in.""

My friend says I should just stick it out because this class is a requirement for my major, but this isn't really the type of learning environment I feel will actually benefit me. Should I just suck it up or find another class that meets the requirements?

https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4wrp56/what_i_tell_incoming_freshman_every_year_good/

All advice on that post aligns with at least one, if both,  of the college books I've read. Srsly read it lol.

P. S. (entirely unrelated) I found a survey app called Pulse for college students exclusively. They often ask questions about depression, school, etc. If you have the time/are interested pls use my referral code (you also get 250 pulse points, note it's only 1200 to redeem a 3 month trial in skillshare) : Follow the link below or enter the code o8yddW5VOR in the app. https://bbuw.app.link/o8yddW5VOR

The survey results are pretty interesting and cover areas like dating, alcohol, intelligence, depression, school etc. It's restricted to college students with a college email address. you can redeem prizes like a 3 month trial to skillshare with just 60 surveys (2 minutes each). I'm trying to get the biggest prize of an electric bike, so that I can bike to a near by climbing gym 2-3 times a week for fitness/training for a climbing competition.

If college was my life, I wouldn’t enjoy my life very much. Instead, it’s just a small part of it.

Plenty of time to figure out what you’re doing, don’t need to worry about that yet. Chances are it’ll find you before you need to find it.

Find yourself. Do this by realizing how the world calls you, and thus realizing your values. Try to learn about God, and why it must exist. If you don’t know it must exist, your definition of God is incorrect and/or underdeveloped. Sufficiently defined, questioning “does God exist?” will be even more redundant than the question “do I exist?”. Pantheism is a good starting point.

The above two will help with your depression, probably.

Find hobbies that you enjoy. Best way to do that is to try a bunch of things you may or may not enjoy, and a few things you’re almost certain you won’t enjoy. 

Don’t worry about society or people. Again, they are secondary. First and foremost, develop your self and personality. 

Take small steps outside your comfort zone. It’s okay to keep one foot in and one foot out.

etfpv7,0.0 GPA first freshman semester,"So, first semester hit me *HARD.* I slacked off, literally skipped every class, and ended up with a 0 GPA. Currently in bad (read: horrible) academic standing.

Even though I'm dumb for having slacked off, I'm academically smart, always been straight A's. and I know I can do it. 

Anyone have any tips on what to do from here on out? Other than actually going to class (which I now know to do... sadly learned it the hard way).

 So I took a lot of peoples advice and reenrolled in mostly the same classes. Sat down and had a chat with an advisor, and YESYESYESYESYES, replace and repeat is a thing!! Grade swap might just end up saving my gpa. 

Sooo, this semester is gonna be a rehash of last one ( classes only, not grades). This is like my second chance at freshman year. 

I :

Signed up for a peer mentor and am currently creating my weekly schedule ( for studying times and whatnot). 
Found out extra tutoring programs for my major (outside of peer mentoring) , aaaaaand am currently trying my best to learn how to study again and manage my time better (slow going but it’s only been around 12 hours)

Things I still gotta do, according to the advice on this post ( ty all btw):
- See a therapist ( appointment set for two weeks from now)
-Get a better social circle (work in progress) 
-Discard all my distractions ( next weekend I’ll drop them off back at home)
-aaaaand, get (and keep) my shit together( this is a semester long goal.

 I needed someone to vent to so I called my grandma.
She was so thrilled that I called and was so happy to talk to me. I let out all my frustrations and she gave me encouraging compliments. It made me feel so great when she told me that I would make her proud even if I did end the semester with bad grades. It was just 15 minutes of pure wholesome. 
She prayed for me over the phone and asked when my tests were so she could pray during that time.
Now she's telling all her friends to do the same for me.

esffqp,How do people make lasting friendships in college?,"I’ve been at my school for a year and a half and the truth is I have not made a single friend that I’ve hung out with, or really even enjoyed as much as some friends I used to have in high school, because everything always remains extremely surface level. I don’t even know where to begin to start. my classes are huge, and I’ve been in many classes where i didn’t know the name of a single person. I’ve done intramural sports but I never build anything that remotely lasts outside of that environment, and I don’t how to reach out to anyone to maybe do something outside because I feel no confidence in my ability to mantain anyone’s interest 1 on 1, and has often been the case in my life. I feel pretty lonely sometimes and don’t really have a lot of confidence, and I don’t understand how people meet people and actually create something that lasts. I have an amazing girlfriend who I hang out with every day, and she has great friends who are also my friends, but I’m pretty sure if it weren’t for her, I probably wouldn’t really ever find ways to hang out with them since I never reach out to them on my own, and they are all girls, which makes me feel like a bit of an oddball and makes me wonder if I’m annoying being the only guy there.

drh7pp,So today was the first day of college and I missed my first period.,"So I commute to my uni. The drive is 1.5 hours. I knew the directions and all and reach the bus stop on time. The uni is like 20 min walk from the bus stop and oh fucking well I lost my way. It took me like 40 minutes to find my university. First period was 1.5 hours so I had to walk around for 1 hour. Holy shit this was the worst experience ever. Freshers arent allowed inside library so library was not an option. It was hot today and my bags were heavy. I just roamed around uni for an hour and attended the next class. How to pass your time in situations like this?

Edit: So seems like there are few confusions here. 
1. When I said freshers I didnt really mean like for a whole year. We arent allowed to enter the library without student IDs. So yeah I couldn't enter. We will probably get them in a week or so. 
2. Period = class. I'm not a native speaker so please understand. We call them periods here idk.

dp43kr,College cancelled classes after a shooting and IDK what to do.,"Just to give some context, I go to Texas A&M University-Commerce. This last Saturday night/Sunday morning, quite a few students decided to host an unsanctioned party outside of Greenville for Homecoming. Long story short, a shooter shows up with a target in mind and kills/injures 14-16 people (I dont know the specifics). 

The whole school felt super dark that Monday, and most students just turned up absent. However, I was just glad to get back into the groove of things and take my mind off the situation. Well, Monday night, the school said that Monday absences would be excused and classes would be mandatorily canceled Tuesday and Wednesday.

I dont have any assignments to do, people to talk to, or events to attend that could take my mind off everything. Now Im left sulking in my dorm, thinking about it. Its 4 on Wednesday now, and its still the only thing on my mind. Any suggestions to make it through tomorrow?




EDIT: So Ive been reading the comments, and I just have to say, thanks for all the suggestions and support. I do have a few things to note.

At the moment, its cold, gloomy, and wet outside, so swimming is off the table. I did go for a walk, but the cold made it hard to relax. I decided to snap a few photos of the empty campus, and Ill likely be posting them later this week.

Hanging with friends isn't really an option. Most of the time, Ill ask to grab a coffee or eat lunch after class, but I dont have anyones number.

My plans for today is probably to practice my drawing, play OuterWorlds, head to this Halloween thing at 5, and read my Churchill book until I fall asleep. Tomorrow, classes are back up, so Ill definitely see if I can catch a cup with someone.

acr2jj,I have lost my personality,"I am a Computer Science major. I met with some of my classmates from high school recently and found it incredible how I've completely lost my ""flow"" with them. In high school, we had very similar personalities and were able to joke around with each other easily. However, this time it didn't feel like I was the same person. I thought high school Me was going to magically come back out again, but this time I acted just like college Me - Socially awkward, no sense of humor, difficulty paying attention to what was happening, constantly thinking about schoolwork, etc. It's like college has killed the old me and replaced it with an automaton who only exists to study for exams, work through assignments, etc. 

I miss the old me. I feel like college has ruined who I am by isolating me from other people for so long. I thought the reason I was so serious all the time was because college is just a serious place and as soon as I was out I would be normal again. It's starting to piss me off because I don't want to just be a robot for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm no longer a real person.

I constantly move away from people, I never sit next to anyone and I always move as far away as I can if someone sits next to me. I also don't make conversation unless absolutely necessary, and I have no experience with small talk.

g2oydo,PSA: Never pay for a job or internship!,"I know that a lot of us have had our summer internships canceled and are looking for other opportunities, but we need to be able to smell bullshit. Any place that offers you a ""guaranteed"" internship in exchange for cash is a SCAM. If a company wants you to pay ""onboarding fees"" or wants you to ""invest"" in their products that you are supposed to sell, run away! A legitimate company will provide you with any materials necessary to do the job. Unfortunately, many of us are increasingly desperate for opportunities and lots of scumbags (especially MLMs) are going to try to take advantage of us. If you have no other career-relevant plans for the summer, you are much better off taking summer classes, reaching out to local businesses and offering your services as a remote intern, doing an independent research project, or building a portfolio. Don't get scammed.

edit: I should clarify that this does not necessarily apply to travel/living costs, although personally I would raise my eyebrow at an employer that requires relocation and/or travel without offering any kind of assistance.

d9yl2n,"My professor lowkey called me stupid, for no fault of my own. The worst part? I wanted to work with him on project.","College started a month ago, before joining I had seen this professor's profile, research and was quite impressed. I possibly wanted to do my Masters dissertation with him. 

We have lab sessions which said professor takes. I was performing experiment assigned to me. It was done by a batchmate in the session before it. The said batchmate tells me to do experiment in X way which I find very dubious. Like, we were supposed to find a quantity (Wavelength) and the said classmate used a ready-made chart of wavelength which frankly made the experiment pointless. Whereas the instruction sheet told to do it in Y way. Mind you that we have done experiments in way that are not given in instruction sheets before. 

Let me tell you that I have a lot and lot of self doubt so even if I know that the X way to do stuff is wrong, I go and ask the professor to confirm. He's super condescending and asks me to figure it out on my own. By the end of lab session he asks me- ""so... What was your question again?"" I say it and he is like ""I generally don't say this...but this question was frankly stupid"". Fml. 


I would highly appreciate your advice on this.

flvpf0,Reflecting on my University years thanks to the Corona Pandemic,"I'm in my final year of University, I was just about to write my papers but due to the whole Corona situation school has been closed indefinitely. As I was packing my things getting ready to leave tomorrow I started thinking of the time I've spent in school and one thing that stood out to me was the fact that I didn't make any effort to socialize and get to know people (especially girls).

I didn't have fun or go to parties I just buried my head in my books for four years, before I consoled myself with the fact that these University years are temporary and it's worth sacrificing them for a brighter future. But then it occurred to me ""isn't everything in a way temporary"", there's no time or period in our lives that last forever, life itself doesn't last forever we're just left with memories and the older one gets the faster the years go by.

Then I fantasize about becoming this rich famous person and as a result those who rejected me or treated me badly will regret their actions.Then I realized no one would really give a fuck, sure they will probably tell their friends they knew me but outside of that I will rarely come up in their mind and they will live their lives normally. 

To make things worse I will never be in this kind of environment again with such a high density of young beautiful women I can easily talk to because outside of University it will get harder to meet and talk to new people. It will take some painful and deliberate effort to meet someone and one would probably have to compromise on their standards too because it will feel like you're racing against the clock.

It's not all bad though I'm on a 3.8 CGPA and I have some decent job offers waiting for me when I'm done with University. But I feel like no matter how successful I get in life it won't make up for the fact that I've missed out on so much in my University years. I also fear that going forward most relationships will be transactional as to what can I gain from this person. In personal relationships too in the sense that I'll probably be vetted whether I have a stable income before my personality comes into question. 

I'm not trying to make a point here, I'm not even sure of half of the things I've said, I'm just sad and confused. I have never really had any real life experience or had any sort of fun per say, I've always just been focused on school right from a young age living a sheltered life and I was hoping I could fix that in University but I'm almost done now. I'm scared of what's waiting for me out there. I honestly don't think I'm ready ..fuck I don't know.

Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks",college,704,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/flvpf0/reflecting_on_my_university_years_thanks_to_the/,False,,75,"Not the exact same, but kinda similar.

But, even then, i spent a lot of it holed up in my room alone, or regretting not doing things.

My advice? I guess, as hard as it may be, be happy for the experiences you have. If you look back at it and keep regretting it, you'll go crazy (iv'e gone slightly crazy). At the end of the day, college is just another part of your life, for better or worse. I think the main lesson learned is live your life fuller. You realize now how yes academics is important but a social life, parties (if youre into them) boyfriend/girlfriends, friends, just hanging out with friends are SO important and what you'll remember when you look back. Dont neglect work or studies, but if anything, put relationships first imo. Also, i saw someone mention doing a ""victory lap"" of an extra semester. Financially, it may be tough, and idk if i can recommend it. But, if you have the funds/are ok with it, i'd say go for it. You do only have these things (college) once. Once it's over, that book is shut.

TLDR: don't waste it, live your life fully, focus on work and studies but make (imo) a bigger focus on relationships and memories. ",2020-03-20 22:14:49
e9hk82,I’m (18F) not interested in a STEM major anymore and I’m scared to tell my parents,"So I’m just about finished with my first semester at University, and my current major is computer science. Well we took the final for the class, submitted final projects, all that jazz and my overall grade has ended up being a C or C+. Usually this would be fine to pass a class however for this intro class we need a B to move on. Now I already wasn’t a fan from like the third week of school, and now that I have to retake this class I’m just straight up not having a good time, and when looking at the next class it’s basically the same concepts being taught again, and I really don’t want to do this kind of stuff three times. I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data structures and algorithms just aren’t my cup of tea and I’m bored and not performing as well as I had hoped. 

I was looking through what my university had to offer and I saw something I’m really interested in,  creative media and animation. I already draw and I’m teaching myself how to use blender in my free time and that just sounds way more enjoyable as something I could do as a career. Except like the title says, it’s not a STEM major, and ya know the cliche of starving artists...but I really much rather do something I enjoy rather than what I’m being expected to do despite the average pay being less. 
	
I guess I need help with figuring out if this is a risk and/or just something stupid and if I go through with it how do I tell my parents?

Edit: adding some info cause of repetitive replies, no hard feelings yo

So I have done research, I’m okay with the average annual income and I know that it’ll be tough to start out with but it’s that way for almost everyone so I’m expecting it. I’ve been looking into internships, however as far as I’ve seen they are looking for upperclassmen so I plan on using the time now to building up a portfolio and learn as much as I can inside and outside the classroom because i really want to do this. I’m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love. 

I’m currently receiving financial aid, however my parents have said they’d help me pay it back, but they threatened if I failed  I would be on my own. So that’s a sort of double hit. 

Overall, I’m prepping as much as I can for both short term and long term goals.

Edit2: I don’t plan on studying typical art where I sit down and paint, I specifically want to go into 3D modeling/rigging that could be used in animation and games. 

As someone mentioned, a degree isn’t going to guarantee a job in anything, yes there is high demand for different things but I think looking at this like “you’d actually make money in stem” is unfair.  Again,  I realize that it won’t be easy either way, and I’m not in school to have fun, I’m here because I want to learn, I played it safe and went into CS because I already had some experience with programming, but if I’m already feeling burn out and miserable I don’t want to waste all that time and money. 

I’m fully aware of what I’d be getting into both ways.",college,708,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/e9hk82/im_18f_not_interested_in_a_stem_major_anymore_and/,False,,156,do IT degree ? ,2019-12-12 10:41:36
e9rktt,Thoughts on being alone in college?,"So I came into college with a friend from high school as my roommate but she turned out to be a pretty crappy roommate/friend. Eventually moved out so we don’t talk. I’ve told my mom about it and she feels bad I haven’t made any more friends. I’ve always had a rough time making friends. Not trying to be like “I’m not like other girl’s” or “I’m so quirky” but I have always found it really difficult to fit in with people. All of my friends back home were the ones that approached me. When I do approach people I always feel really awkward and nervous but when I think I did well with carrying a conversation and I think me and the other person hit it off, they never feel the same and we don’t talk anymore. It does make me kinda discouraged with making friends. Being in college, I am always around people in their big groups of friends and it’s like how the hell did y’all become friends? Even since day one, people had their groups already. That being said, I don’t mind being alone. I’ve experienced all semester sitting alone and eating alone and I actually really like it. I don’t have to have a conversation and I can just eat and watch YouTube. It does get kinda boring though and it reminds me of grade school of when I could go a whole school day of not talking. That’s how it sometimes is since I’m not really close to my other roommates. They’re nice though so that’s good.

8ijct1,I just finished the last final of my college career. Here are some of the things I've learned over the past five years.,"**Academic**

* Don't freak out if you don't immediately love your major when starting out. I majored in criminal justice and for the first two semesters I was really unsure of my choice. But I decided to stick it out, and I'm very glad I did. 

* However, if you REALLY don't like what you're studying, don't be afraid of change! Do some research, decide what's important to you, and TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR. 

* Seriously, talk to your advisor. They're there to help you. If you're worried about a class, or need a change, a good advisor will have your back.

* Obviously you want to get good grades; that's a big part of college. BUT: Don't think it's the end of the world if you get a B-, or a C, or even a D in some cases. Take a breath. Calm down. You're not going to flunk out of college because of one bad grade. We've all had classes we struggle with (that was math and science for me). The important thing is that you try your best and don't let it take over your life.

* If you are having trouble with a class, like you're just not getting the material and keep struggling, talk with the professor! Most of them are more than happy to help you out. Also look for tutoring programs. I used one to help pass statistics and it saved my grade.

* While signing up for classes, if you know one of them is going to be more of a challenge, try to give yourself some breathing room. For instance, when I took statistics, I made sure all my other credits were criminal justice related because A) I knew that material well and B) they were more enjoyable. Spread out the misery, so to speak.

* Don't skip class unless you actually HAVE to, not because you WANT to. I shudder thinking back on how many times I skipped and what it probably did to my grade. Some classes, especially first/second year ones, also count attendance towards your points.

* I know the saying ""sleep is for the weak"" is popular, but don't take that to heart. Sleep is important. Putting off a project/studying for a test until the day before and pulling an all-nighter isn't going to turn out well.

* However, if you DO have to pull an all-nighter, try to get at least some sleep. Some people can run on three or four hours, others need more. Listen to your body.

**Dorm life**

I lived in a dorm for the first two years of college before getting an apartment. Here's some tips:

* Yes, ramen is cheap at first glance, but it's utter shit in terms of nutrition. It's also not as inexpensive as some people believe. A 10lb bag of rice, in the long run, will be much cheaper (and healthier!). Learn to use spices, even just basic ones. Here are some other cheap, relatively healthy foods and ideas:

1) Eggs

2) Fruits like bananas, oranges, etc

3) Potatoes

4) Frozen veggies

5) For breakfast: Oatmeal, healthy cereal, etc

6) Replace soda with tea, or even seltzer water if it's the fizz you miss. I've got a love affair with Safeway-brand orange seltzer now. Avoid energy drinks at all costs. They're 99% sugar and can wreck your body.

7) Seriously, learn how to season. A little bit of spice goes a long way. Cayenne, paprika, thyme, and garlic powder are some of my go-tos.

* Exercise. Even if it's just fifteen minutes a day walking, or a short jog, or doing a few reps of weights in your room. You feel 10x better and your body will thank you.

* It's easier to keep your room clean by maintaining a regular chore schedule than trying to clean everything up at once. 

* FFS, wear shower shoes/sandals. Communal showers are gross. Chances are some nasty-ass dude probably jerked it in there that morning. 

* If you've got roommates, be respectful. My first roomie and I were total opposites in terms of hobbies and habits, but we got along just fine because we respected each other, did necessary chores, kept the room clean, and was aware of each others' sleeping/studying schedules. Basically, don't be a dick.

* Try to be nice your RA's. I know some of them can be assholes (speaking from experience, I was one for a while) but they're just trying to do their jobs most of the time. Go to them if you've got an issue.

* Don't totally rely on meal plans if that's a thing at your college. Mine, if used as the college intended, would only get you one meal a day. Learn to cook basic stuff and you'll save a ton of money in the long run.

* Keep your goddamn music down, or wear headphones. Seriously.

* It can be challenging, or even downright scary to try and meet new friends, but at least give it a shot. I'm extremely introverted and it took a while to start meeting people, but it was worth it. Don't just hole up in your room all day.

**Work/school/social life**

* Working while going to school can be a blessing and a curse. The income is great, but if you're taking 18 credits at the same time it sucks. If you can, try to find a job with flexible scheduling. University/college jobs are usually really good about this.

* While it is possible to work full-time and go to school as well, it can SUCK at times. I did that this past year working midnight shift. There were a lot of days I was running off three hours of sleep. I also sacrificed any semblance of a social life. 

* The same guidelines above apply to internships. If you're having to bend over backwards and sacrifice your soul to make it work, you should ask yourself if it's worth it. 

* Sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as much as you can. It's a bit cliche, but it's true.

* You need to have a day or two off now and again to decompress. I've met people who dedicated themselves solely to schoolwork pretty much 24/7 and it wrecked them by the end of the semester. Conversely, think of college like a job. Do the work and don't slack off. It's all about balance.

* On the topic of parties: Be safe! Never leave your drink unattended. Have a sober driver, take an uber, walk, but under NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU GET BEHIND THE WHEEL WHILE INTOXICATED. The same applies to any other illicit substances. Intoxicated/impaired drivers are the scum of the earth. Try to have a sober friend with you if you're going somewhere unfamiliar, or with people you don't know well.

* Have fun! College is supposed to be enjoyable. Don't torture yourself just because you think it's 100% about getting good grades.

* Mental illness is a big issue in college. Don't ever hesitate to get help if you need it, even if you don't think it's a ""big deal"". You wouldn't just tough out a broken leg or bacterial meningitis; don't treat your brain the same way.",college,697,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8ijct1/i_just_finished_the_last_final_of_my_college/,False,,44,You should seriously make this into a book.

This semester we had to do our work through myitlab and show for class in zoom meetings. I've contacted my professors about my low grades and one of them says that i never showed up for the meetings (i did regularly) and another says that I have never send in my homework (I did and she replied that she got my homework) now she says that she never got an email to begin with. Both of them keep saying that I never emailed them when I did and I even have screenshots of their replies to prove it. I'm losing my sanity.

If that doesn’t work, contact either the school you are transferring to and show the graded work and syllabus to show the mistake on the schools end. 

If that doesn’t work, contact local news stations and reporters on twitter to see if the story can run.

64ak00,I'm a professor: This is what I tell my family members BEFORE they go to college.,"I know it is college season and many of you are picking a school or looking to switch schools. I see your questions and your comments on the front page of /r/college. Some of you have parents that went to college and some of you don't. Some of you are traditional and some are nontraditional with respect to age. Some of you are veterans and some have never had a job. I want to give you a piece of advice I give to my family members. You can take it or leave it, but don't discount what I say because you don't like it; I'm tenured, I've been doing this a very long time. I've spent nearly two decades now within the walls of a college in some capacity. 

**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered ""top"" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an ""in"" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. 

**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive. The average student loan debt in the US right now is around $30K for a bachelor's. This is about a $300/month loan payment for 10 years. In general, you can expect $100/month repayment for every $10K you take out. I see a LOT of students who are ROYALLY screwing themselves over here. Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, ""yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out."" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.

**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. 

**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.

**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. 

**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. 

 TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the ""real college experience"" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's.

I was able to see it on the class playlist, and there it was, the name of the two other guys, and a third guy that wasn’t even in our group to my knowledge, so again, I text other guy who also didn’t help build the video, but still had his name in the video, because he was good friends with the guy who did the video. I don’t know if there’s anything I can do, on my first post, I was told to take the L, because to be fair, I could have been more proactive which makes sense, but any other advice is welcome.

Edit: he finally responded!!!

dla6pv,Any tips for dealing with crappy professors?,"First day of class my professor assigns a controversial topic 5 paragraph essay. These are so easy I can do them in my sleep. She then goes on to have us brainstorm on the topic “reasons why people drop out of college.” People say things like “money issues, health issues, mental health, family problems, interest change, etc.” And she said “mental health isn’t a real thing so don’t ever write a paper about it, people who can’t afford college shouldn’t be in college, and family problems arent important at all, especially when it comes to your education.” So a brave soul stood up and asked “so you’re saying we cannot write about these reasons if we write about reasons students drop out?” And she laughed and said “I’ll throw it in the trash in front of you”

I go on to write my paper about whether or not college athletes should be paid. And tried to use graduate transfers as an example because they already have a degree and do not go to class.. she took my paper and threw it in the garbage in front of the class because I wrote something using another college’s football team as an example. (I go to a community college right now)

So is this normal behavior? Or should something be done about it? I just want some tips on how to deal with




UPDATE POST:


So I’m not too familiar with reddit yet so idk exactly how to make an update post, but I just went to the department head of liberal arts of my community college, she was busy (of course) and I was asked to wait. 10ish minutes go by and I asked her receptionist if I can run to the bathroom. I get up to go and find there’s a doctorate professor with open office hours; so I go and ask her specifically about my paper (which I had to pick up out of the trash) and ask her what exactly was “wrong”. She looks through it and says “well looks like your professor said you didn’t do MLA correctly” (I’ve been doing MLA papers since 5th grade and my comp 1 prof said I was excellent at MLA formatting). Paper was double spaced, TNR with 12 pt font. 1 inch margins, etc. She assumes I’m upset with the professor because “you got a bad grade. They won’t switch you because you don’t have a valid reason.” So im already a little pissed off because I have to deal with my professor and now the higher level professors are telling me I can’t switch either. 

I go on to argue with her and try and plead my case and still she says no. Again not even her decision if I can switch, that’s the department head’s job. Then I bring up “well my professor said mental health isn’t a real thing and personally I’ve got bad anxiety and have been working through it. So how can I deal with my anxiety when I have a professor who thinks it’s all a joke?” And IMMEDIATELY she turns around what she’s saying and says “let me get you in with the dean right now and fill out the student issues form” 

So I’m still waiting for the dean and will update this post again whenever I’m done! 

Again sorry if it’s sloppy or hard to find, I’m still new to reddit and don’t know a lot!




UPDATE 2: 

Dean dodged my meeting and told me to schedule another one with her receptionist. The receptionist heard 1/2 of my argument and had to stop herself from saying anything negative about the professor. “If it’s a controversial topic essay, it should be written about a topic that’s controversial to the student, not based on what the professor wants to read right?” Is what she asked me and I said “finally someone who gets it!!” And so I’m scheduled to meet with her tomorrow 11:30am. Will update again. 

My goal is solely to get out of this class and hopefully get into a better comp class. I will post my review of her on RMP so hopefully people can avoid her at my college.",college,662,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dla6pv/any_tips_for_dealing_with_crappy_professors/,False,,61,Although I strongly disagree with what she’s saying she still has the right to her opinion.

aid1k6,A guide to life in college (long post),"This guide was written out of inspiration from a reddit comment that I wrote in response to someone asking how to get a 4.0 in college. My advice was not to focus on the grades as much as the overall learning experience, and other important aspects of college, which often get overlooked from a usefulness perspective. These aspects include networking, learning outside of the classroom, exposing yourself to new things, and keeping ones life balances, and trying to keep oneself healthy, both in body and spirit.

## First off:

Balance is important to maintaining a healthy life and maximum productivity. The amount of stuff you get done is not based purely on the amount of time in which you attempt to be productive. Procrastination is often a result of emotional stress and anxiety, and not laziness. Telling yourself to ""just do something"" will not make it easier to be productive towards a particular goal.

This guide aims to give you advice on how to effectively manage your college experience.

## Time Management

Time management is an essential part of being productive. You don't need to account for every second of every minute, but you need to create a schedule that works for you. Attempt to find the worse uses of your time, and eliminate them form your habits.

Use time between classes wisely.

Try to track time and figure out where it goes.

## The Big Five

I like to think of ""the big five"" them as MEDSS ""meds"" with two s's. The big five are meditation, exercise, diet, sleep, and social (activity). Incorporating these into your life on a regular basis will vastly improve it. There may not be any magic pill, but these things will improve your life likely more than any medication will (with some notable exceptions if you are gravely sick). ""The Big Five"" also

### Meditation

Meditation can be easily started with an app such as headspace, or insight timer (I believe there are many others, these are just the ones that I happen to use). Only takes 10-20 minutes a day, and you will see real improvements in your life.

### Exercise

Exercise should be done at least 3x a week, and can be in very many forms. You can do strength training, yoga, cardio (running, rowing, stair stepping, HIIT), climbing, team sports, and many other things. I personally do strength training with some cardio thrown in (not as often as I should with the cardio, but I'm working on it). **Remember, an exercise activity you will do is more important than something that is ideal for maximum health, that you never do.**

I believe that strength and cardiovascular training should be included in everyones workout routine. I personally started strength training with Stronglifts 5x5, and I highly recommend it as something that is simple and easy to get started with. Starting strength is another good option. Please note: you _need_ to use proper form, or you will end up injuring yourself over the long run, I suggest watching the Stronglift's videos and reading the articles on form, and getting a knowledgable friend to check your form. (this does not take much time, just an hour or two, and you don't have to do it all at once)

You can avoid injuries by starting light and working on your form as you add on weight. If you follow Stronglifts you shouldn't have an issue. I did it for 2 years and was previously totally untrained (no previous lifting experience). With 3x a week I made some serious progress. Additionally, strength training will increase the amount of muscle on your body, while decreasing the amount of fat (depending on your diet), so you'll look *hotter*.

### Diet

I am no expert on diet, and there are many debates over what is healthy, mainly make sure to limit your caloric intake (so that you don't gain weight), and to lose weight if you are overweight. I recommend looking into fasting, as it seems to be a useful tool if used properly. HOWEVER PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, AND NOTE THAT FASTING CAN HAVE HUGE EFFECTS ON HOW YOU SHOULD BE DOSING MEDICATIONS.

I also suggest focusing on eating foods with less added sugar, making sure you get your proper daily intake of nutrition. If you want to lose weight, cutting out any beverage that is not water can make a huge difference. Additionally, eating foods that fill you up can help you eat less, since you will be satiated.

Note: if you start lifting, make sure you eat enough, otherwise it will stunt your progress

### Sleep

Sleep is something that very many people vastly overlook. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night is essential for your physical health, emotional wellbeing, and especially for your productivity. Productivity is not a function of hours in times some constant is equal to productivity. Productivity has many factors including your state of mind, how clear your head is, are you actually able to sit down and work to get started. You may gain 2 hours in the day by sleeping 6 hours a night, or gain 4 hours by sleeping 4 hours a night, but you will murder your productivity and health not only in the long run, but in the short run.

Two weeks of getting 6 hours a night is like having a 0.08% BAC, the legal limit. Also staying up for 18 hours consecutively produces similar effects. Sleeping less may be okay for one night at a time, but if you do it every night, you will be less productive, despite having more hours to work.

A very small percentage of the population can manage getting by with less than 7-8 hours, but they are a tiny minority. About 1-5% of the population, I forget the exact statistic. YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT IN THAT GROUP.

College kids, and people in general like to brag about how little sleep they get. Don't be like them, get a healthy amount of sleep. You'll come out ahead in the long run.

Sleep is especially important the nights before exams.

Additionally, try to go to bed at the same time, and wake up at the same time every morning, including weekends.

No blue light before bed, preferably no screens at all. Try reading a book. :)

### Social (activity)

Believe it or not social activity is important to good health. I happened to ignore this for many years, because I tend to isolate myself when I am busy and stressed, and figure I can get more done by staying in my room for days at a time. Social interaction during the day is good, but taking time to get away from your room/routine also does good, especially if you can go to a game night, or concert, or whatever with friends. I don't know exactly what the research says about frequency, but I'd suggest trying to do something at least once a week for a couple of hours. By this, I mean do something outside of normal mingling and gossiping at your workplace, before and after classes, etc.

Social accountability is another powerful tool that will help you. If you can get your friends to be disappointed in you when you don't study properly, or do something you're supposed to do, like exercise, it will be a massive deterrent against doing things poorly. Additionally, finding an exercise buddy can be useful to help you blow off steam, and to encourage you to exercise when you don't want to.

A large part of college is the developing of social relationships, even though you may not be told this going in. Take time to date, meet new people, join clubs, try new things. You will likely not have many of the same opportunities again

Don't hang out with people who are going to get you to do stupid things, and who don't have any ambitions, they _will_ drag you down with them. It doesn't matter if they are good people at heart.

On the flip side, if you hang out with hardworking and successful people, they will encourage you to work harder, and you'll see what helps them succeed. After college they'll be helpful to help you network.

I seriously regret not spending more time with people in college, my mental health would've been better, and I would have likely had better grades as a result, hell maybe even a girlfriend, or some fun stories to tell.

### Dating

**_Never again in life will you be surrounded by so many attractive peers, who are generally open to  many with high ambition. Make use of this opportunity._**

However, keep in a mind, a good relationship may improve your life a little bit, but a bad one will make it much worse, in other words, get out of bad relationships as fast as you can, and preferably stay away from toxic individuals.

## Grades

My original response was to someone who asked about getting a 4.0 in college. My response was, don't focus on an arbitrary target, so much as making sure you use your time wisely. If you are trying to get into medical/law/dental or other professional schools, or into graduate school, having a good GPA is important. However, there are things to consider about GPA.

Say getting a 2.5 GPA takes 10 hours a week of studying, 3.0 takes 15 hours a week, 3.5 takes 25 hours a week, and a 3.75 takes 40 a week, and maybe a 4.0 takes 50 hours a week. Diminishing returns start to kick in heavily. What if you spent that time doing research, or interning, or in clubs and activities that help you build your network. Hell, maybe you could start your own company. Outside of getting into graduate school or a professional program, your GPA won't really matter past your first job. That being said, I'd shoot for at least a 3.0-3.5. (these numbers are 100% made up, find the balance that works for you and your goals)

Find the balance between schoolwork and research, internships, and clubs or other activities. The balance point will be different for everyone.

Your connections, will matter for the rest of your life, as your friends start to move from company to company, and as some of them climb corporate ladders and start their own companies. These connections will get you farther than an extra .25 on your GPA ever would.

**Do not beat yourself up over bad grades**, if you do this you will increase your chances of developing depression. Focus on managing your time effectively. If you manage your time effectively and do not receive the grades you want, it sucks, but it's okay. You can only do so much, and if you are making the most of your time you should be proud of yourself. Continual improvement is more important than perfection. Consistency is also very good.

Consider trying to develop good relationships with a handful of professors who you will use as references for jobs, recommendation letters, etc. It is especially useful if you do research or other non-coursework related activities with them, as they will get to see more of who you really are, and your work ethics.

### Studying

There are effective, and ineffective ways to study and complete coursework. Start off by _going to class_, it'll really make a difference even if you don't think you're learning much. Go and take notes by hand. Taking notes by hand is the most effective way to make sure you're internalizing the information from the lectures.Additionally, ask questions in class, and go to office hours, it doesn't matter if you feel like an idiot, your understanding of the course material is more important than what your classmates think. Most of the time other people in the class have the same question. If you're too afraid to ask during class, go to office hours (this is also a good chance to develop a relationship with professors).

Reading the textbook can be useful for some classes, but not so much for others.

Do homework. Homework gives you practice, and practice makes you better at remembering material, and using complex problem solving abilities. The more you develop problem solving abilities, the easier any question will become.

[This video] is a good source for evidence based studying techniques.

My advice is to trying and make connections between all the concepts in your mind, and how they relate, this will enable you to remember things you forget through related information, or may make you able to reconstruct a piece of information from other pieces of information. This technique has been useful to me many times. People often waste lots of time using rote memorization, but if a question on an exam is slightly different than something they expect, they'll be totally lost, whereas someone who understands the concepts well can adjust quickly, and digest the information.

I did disproportionately well on many exams despite my sometimes lackluster performance on homework. I believe it was due to my focusing on understanding of concepts, and not memorizing problem solutions.**Dumb songs, acronyms and other mnemonic techniques will make things easier to remember, even if they sound stupid.**

On exams I start at the beginning, and when I get stuck on a question, I stop and move on to the next one, often times a solution to something I was previously stuck on will come to me eventually. It is also good to look at all the questions on an exam before starting so you think about them in the back of your head. I don't know if this is pseudoscience, but it works well for me.

Study over weeks, don't cram the night before an exam. Also, make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before an exam, it doesn't matter how much you studied if your brain is functioning at 25% capacity because you didn't sleep before the exam. Get 8 hours.If you're interested in learning to master your memory, check out ""Moonwalking with Einstein"". Anyone can train their memory to memorize lots of things quickly, which can be useful for some classes (and less useful for concept based classes). However, this will take time. I have not tried practicing the techniques, but it is an interesting and worthwhile read.

I suggest figuring out every class you want and are required to take, and make a timeline of when you'll be taking them. Maybe you'll see if you can dual degree or double major, it's much easier to do now than in a few years. Classes will get harder (probably).

You might consider taking a few classes in different disciplines in order to make sure you want to stay in your major, it'll make switching easier if you have a few classes done.

Or, consider doubling down and finishing your classes a year early so you can graduate, or maybe start taking graduate classes and do lots of research.

Take breaks from homework and spread out assignments, sometimes going to bed and then looking at the assignment in the morning will make a difference. Try to do them as soon as they are assigned (assuming you have been taught all you need to do them). This gives you more time to reach out to professors and TA's, and time to put them away when you get stuck.

a11cuw,Tips From Someone Who's Graduating Soon,"Alright so it's finally my senior year and I'm gonna give you my college cheat codes: 

1. Try to sparse out your classes throughout the week. Nowadays some schools follow the MW and TTH rule, meaning like some classes might be on Monday and Wednesday while others will be Tuesday and Thursday. Unless if you are working, try not to schedule your classes all on the same days, especially your first year. The reason being is you're gonna wanna skip, and when you do skip you'll find yourself skipping ALL the courses. Scheduling two courses a day gives you an even flow for college with breaks in between. 
2. Understand how your classes work and how YOU work. Some classes mark participation points and can take a heavy toll on your grade. Other classes don't count participation but offer a lot of material. Use these to your advantage and make sure when you skip classes you know the repercussions. 
3. You're gonna be tempted to eat at the dining hall everyday and drink all the soda from the soda fountain, but pace yourself. Its not healthy to live on soft drinks and pizza. GET A MINI FRIDGE. PUT SOME SALADS IN IT. BUY FUCKING WATER. 
4. Toilet paper is a necessity you won't think about until you run out of it. In the even that you do run out and don't have cash to spare most dorms have a public bathroom in their lobby and usually are accessible at all times. It's a pain in the ass but a good contingency plan 
5. If you're doing horrible in your classes: communicate with your professors early on. Don't just drop the class or continue to flunk. Usually professors understand that some students are going to have a hard time pacing themselves and are willing to work with you if you reach out to them early on. 
6. If you are in the middle of the semester and you feel like you're going to fail a class, speak with you academic adviser and see if you can take it pass/fail. Usually you need a legitimate reason for this (disability, sickness, financial troubles), but showing your academic adviser that you're serious about your goals will make them more willing to help you
7. Remember not everyone has the stereotypical college experience as you see in movies and TV, and that not every college experience is the same. Personally I had to take breaks in between semesters, transfer my courses to a different university, change majors a few times, take part time courses, take summer courses, work part time and go to school full time, and work full time and go to school full time. College should be taken at your own pace based on YOUR needs. If you can't afford it, its okay to take a break and work to save up the money. If you realize you aren't in the right path, its OK to change majors.

a4qau2,Why does it seem like so many people are so anxious and depressed?,"Hello everyone, hope you are all having a fun finals week.

&#x200B;

I have made a discovery lately that has made me think quite a bit.  As I have become a bit more comfortable with my own insecurities and tried to talk to others it seems like a lot of my friends and people I know are terribly anxious inside and are overwhelmed by many things in our current society but NOBODY will talk about it. It seems like most people I end up talking to feel extremely insecure and overwhelmed with college life and people but everybody just puts on a facade and pretend it's okay.

&#x200B;

I know this is natural and nobody want's to look weak and maybe I am a bit naive here but it's a bit saddening to know that many people around me are just as anxious or stressed as me. Maybe it's just me and my upbringing but at my college I am curious where the realness is? I literally don't even understand people anymore and I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it.

&#x200B;

I just want to understand things and not be so hard on myself in these times and I can't tell if it's just a personal problem due to my lack of experience or if everybody is kind of struggling?

9gndbu,I feel like colleges are scamming students with low-effort teaching. What can we do about it?,"This subject, I’m sure, gets us all teeming with anger. 

And the sad part is: almost all university students have been there.

When you are at University you are paying hundreds of dollars for a credit hour. I am a resident of the state my university is in, so I pay $212 for a credit hour; when I have to take a typical three credit class I am paying $636 for a class; times five for a fifteen credit semester and that comes out to $3,180. For an out of state student that means you are going to pay $10,608 for a semester and $2,151 for one credit-hour class. 

When you have a terrible teacher that’s some bullshit. 

So that’s why I am asking: where is the accountability for teachers? I know there are teacher reviews at the end of the semester but what use is that when you have already paid for the semester and have learned nothing? Why do teachers with bad reps amongst the student body continue to teach? 

Students, why are we just letting this happen? 

And what can we do to stop it?

I want to call out my university, The University of Florida, out on some bullshit. Why are these teachers who put no effort into their classes allowed to teach? 

I want to do something but I don’t know what you should do to effectively end this! 

(Like I said, I know there are lecturer reviews at the end of the semester but I don’t think these are really being acted upon. There are teachers with bad reps at my school amongst the student body.)

At first I looked at it as a sign of laziness and lack of discipline. I viewed the getdisciplined subreddit for some tips. However, when I start doing the work, it does not simply flow smooth for me as people simply suggest. This essentially happens for assignments that I find absolutely boring. They feel like such a terrible pain to do. So I immediately get distracted without any will to touch them. I've read that you have to learn to accept the pain now to be less stressed later on. However, this just doesn't go for me. Even fear, the biggest motivator, doesn't do it for me. The fear makes me stressed to the point of sweating, but it is hard to get myself to do work.

7mm5ol,My guide to a 4.0,"**Background:**

I graduated somewhat recently in physics and applied maths with a cumulative GPA of 4.00. I've seen a lot of posts here on r/college over the last few years of people freaking out over their grades and/or looking for advice on how to do well, and maybe some of what I've learnt could help others. Obviously, this stuff is aimed towards STEM since that's all I really know, but general tips map over to the humanities. These tips are in no particular order, just whatever comes into my head. Most are probably (very) obvious, and it's long. I've also TA'd for numerous classes, so if you have more specific questions r.e. maths or physics study or heading into grad for either, I can answer in comments or PM. This is certainly not an exclusive list, it's just a general one.

tldr: 

 - Go to class

 - Pay attention in class

 - Do the work

 - Put effort into the work

 - Plan ahead

 - Read the goddamn syllabus

 - Get help early

 - If you need accommodations, get them

 - Be nice to the professor

 - Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc

 - Study to the tests/exams

 - Don't say you'll do better ""next time""

 - Know how you learn best

 - Have your priorities straight

 - Be prepared to let it all go


--------

**Go to class**.

It shouldn't need to be said, but there it is. Even if the class is boring as all hell and you think you already know it all, go anyway. Some classes take attendance, some give pop-quizzes, some offer extra material not available online or in any recordings/notes, but it's just a good idea to be present regardless. Our brains form associations really quickly, so you'll learn better in the lecture hall that you always learn in rather than sitting at the desk you regularly play computer games at. You'll also be able to ask for clarification in real time, which no recording or personal study will ever afford you. Plus, it gets you in the professors good books, or at least helps keep you out of the bad books. That's incredibly important. 

**Pay attention in class**.

Once you're there, you need to actually listen. No browsing on your phone, no checking twitter on your laptop, no chatting with your neighbours, and no work from other classes. You should be paying such ardent attention that you are exhausted at the end of a 1-hour lecture. You will undoubtedly fail occasionally, but you need to force yourself to refocus every time. Do whatever you have to in order to keep paying attention. For me, that meant always taking notes by hand even if notes were printed and handed out to us by the professor before class. I never revised by my own notes, but it was important to take them anyway. The more effort you put in to learning it the first time around, the less work you need to do outside of class.

**Do the work**.

Again, should be pretty clear why, but this is the biggest reason why people fail IME. It's actually really *hard* to fail a class if you give every assignment a proper try and hand them all in on time. Even if you know you've left it way too late and can't possibly get it completed, a half-assed 50% is magnitudes better than a 0%. 

**Put effort into the work**.

Never hand in any piece of assessment as ""good enough"". Your final-copy 5-page assignment in maths should originally be a 20-page draft when you include your additional derivations and long-working. Don't skip steps: it doesn't make you look smarter, it just makes mistakes easier. I will happily expand out factors term by term if it avoids a mistake. Do your work neatly and follow standards in setup/layout. Chicken-scratch ramblings don't get a prize; the less pleasant your work is to mark, the less lenient markers will be. Remember that there is a human marking your work, so intersperse the maths with some words explaining what you're doing and why. You can still be awarded marks for correct reasoning even if you make a foolish mathematical error somewhere. This also applies to exams and tests: if you make a mistake somewhere but can't find it or don't have time to fix it, make a note of it on the paper. If you really run out of time, list the steps you *would* have taken. That'll get you something too. Also do sanity checks on your results: you've probably made a mistake if the ball is travelling faster than c.

**Plan ahead**. 

Life is shitty, and shitty things happen unexpectedly. Maybe your car breaks down, maybe your neighbours keep you up with loud music all night, maybe your dog is sick, maybe your computer fails spectacularly, maybe the power gets cut off, and maybe you just plain forget something. Have reasonable contingencies for these sorts of events. Leave a little earlier to account for any delays in travel, finish your work a day or two earlier, keep backups in multiple places, email yourself copies of important documents, set copious alarms, and have some kind of planner. Know when difficult weeks are coming up and start things earlier than usual to reduce workload later on. Being organised is probably the *most important* thing you can do to ensure success. Your memory and ability to react quickly and reasonably to complex situations is really not that great, so craft these safety nets ahead of time. It's enough to simply have a plan that you are aware of. Fix problems *before* they are problems. 

**Read the goddamn syllabus**.

Don't get caught out by participation marks after you've already missed half of the lectures. Know how much different sections are worth and roughly when they are due (some due dates may change). Be aware of minimum requirements, especially for lab classes. All of my classes had rules that you had to get >45% in all of the lab, homework, and exam portions in order to pass the class. If you got 70% overall but 40% in the lab portion, too bad - you fail. A syllabus is not a legally binding contract, but they are quite important nonetheless. Also, **keep the syllabus**. Partly in case you need to dispute something, but also, in some situations when transferring credits, universities will ask for the syllabus from your classes to judge equivalency. They are usually required to be from the correct semester/year as well IME, so no sneakily grabbing a newer one.

**Get help early**.

If you struggle to understand something in week 1, get help for it in week 1. Not week 2 and not week 13, *week 1*. Your problem with the content doesn't go away once the class moves on, it just starts festering under the surface and jeopardising everything you learn past that point. This also applies to mental health or other extreme personal circumstances. Professors and administrators can do a lot to help you early on in semester with medical withdrawals and the like, but they can't do much at all to help past a certain point. Don't look at asking for help as ""begging"", but rather as taking agency over your own learning and your own life, and recognising when you need more information/support to work at your best. You cannot control what happens to you, but you *can* control how you deal with it. 

**If you need accommodations, get them**.

If you know you have ADHD or are prone to mental illness like Depression, get the required documentation and get accommodations from your university. It isn't some dick-measuring contest to see how long you can go without your meds and there's no gold star for foregoing all treatment. University life is *tough* for a lot of people. If you try to go it alone and fail, *you* are the one who suffers from that sort of hubris. I had accommodations for issues with concentration and processing speed. My internals and labs were great, but my early tests were consistently 20% lower; having accommodations simply levelled the playing field and made my grades more regular. Real life is not like an exam and you do not need to sit under the same conditions. If you need an extra 30 minutes or a quiet room to work in, get it. Having these accommodations can also help with requests for extensions or leniency in marking if you suddenly fall ill. It certainly saved my ass a few times. 

**Be nice to the professor**.

(Assuming they're a reasonable human being, of course) In many classes, the professor has a lot of power. They set the rules of their class and they are also free to bend those rules as they see fit. If the professor likes you, they may give you an extension when you're stressed out or simply forget homework, will invest more time and energy into your learning, offer you extra opportunities in their field, act as great letter writers later on, and simply be a great addition to your network. Many of the things I achieved during undergrad came from my contacts with professors, who then pointed me towards friends with good opportunities in national labs and prestigious universities. The person with the personal contact wins every time. 

**Be extra nice to the department administrator/receptionist/etc**.

Professors are actually kinda clueless when it comes to the running of the department, but the local head administrator knows all. Befriend the person who's actually in charge and you'll never be stuck in endless loops of administration bullshit ever again. Hiring opportunities inside *and* outside of the department flow through this person first, as do many applications afterwards. Forms you need to fill out will pass this point as well, and they are often the ones with a tight hold on the money-strings. They also know their equivalent in other departments, and can get you priority meetings/appointments. They are typically well-known and very well-liked, and their seal of approval on you carries weight. 

**Study to the tests/exams**.

Don't do 100 problems out of a dusty textbook your professor has never used as the format and method of solution will be slightly different. When you're first learning something, using multiple distinct methods can throw you off and you gain nothing from the exercise. Look at previous exams if available through your library to get a feel for the general format, as questions tend to be similar over the years. If these are not available, then use previous questions set to you or other questions from the same pool. Study strategically to match. 

**Don't say you'll do better ""next time""**.

So many of my friends would get 60% in an assignment, brush it off immediately, and say they'd just make up for it next week. They never did. Assume your grades will *decline* over the course of the semester as you become stressed and burnt out, so put effort in early. If you get a poor mark, organise to discuss your mistakes with the professor ASAP. For the next assignment, ask to have it checked a day or two *before* you submit it. Professors and TAs are usually more than happy to review drafts of substantial work before submission, you just need to ask and be willing to hear criticism. It is not an attack on your character, they are literally just telling you what you need to do to earn a higher grade by the rubric they have. 

**Know how you learn best**.

If you do your best work between 7pm-9pm, then save tough things for that time. If you find it hard to get up and pay attention in 8am classes, try to avoid signing up for classes at that time. If you know which professors teach to the style you like to learn in, take their section if available and suitable. But always be reassessing these methods. If the evidence of your results isn't backing up your statements, you need to figure out what's going wrong and fix it ASAP. Keep your fingers on the pulse at all times and be ready to adapt. 

**Have your priorities straight**.

Know how important your grades are to you from the beginning and stick to that. After a terrible run in high school, I decided that I wouldn't settle for any kind of mediocrity and whenever I lost focus, I reminded myself of that goal. Don't say that you want top grades and then act completely opposite to that statement. But don't go too far the other way either: if you get to the end of your degree and have nothing but a 4.0, then you've wasted a lot of your time. You need to have experience in your field and other things going for you. Know what is important/necessary and what is not for your specific goals and living situation. If you need a supermarket job to pay the bills, keep it. If you really don't need the money, find something more constructive and relevant to do with your time. 

**Be prepared to let it all go**.

Getting ""good"" grades is a matter of effort, planning, and natural aptitude in some measure. Graduating with a 4.0 specifically is pure luck. Even a headache on the day of an important exam can send things down the drain, and no matter how well you plan ahead, random events *will* affect you. I failed in plenty of the above tips over the last 3 years. I skipped out on weeks of classes because I thought I knew everything, I didn't plan ahead properly and had horrible all-nighters, I tried to get through without disability accommodations, I allowed myself to get so ill as to not hand in assignments, and I crammed for exams. Blind luck and the curve pulled me through every time, but it could easily not have. Finishing with a 4.0 is nice, getting that sweet medal is cool, but it means next to nothing the day after grades are released. After you land that first position, it really won't mean anything at all. Keep the achievement in perspective and don't lose sight of the things that really matter at this point in your life, whatever that point is. But if you want that 4.0 just as a personal goal and keep sight of everything else, don't let people dissuade you from it or convince you that you should care less. If you want to set the bar high, make sure it's feasible but then hold yourself to it.

8z295a,Community College is NOT Always the Best Option.,"I’ve seen a lot of people here suggest that if you don’t go to community college for two years, you are making a stupid decision since there are absolutely no downsides. According to them, every single person should go to community college first.

Community college can be an amazing option for many people, but it is NOT as black and white as many of you make it seem.

Here are just some potential negatives of going to community college

- If you want to go in to a field that values prestige (say, finance) you will have a very difficult time getting internships your first two summers. In fact, most big banks now recruit Junior summer interns during their sophomore spring, so make that your first three summers. That will seriously impact career prospects out of school. Also, contrary to what some may adamantly say, almost every field values prestige to an extent. 

- Even if you only want to apply for an internship Junior year, employers will likely not like the fact that you only have a semester (or less) of grades to show at your school.

- Networking is an important part of college. You are missing out on a lot of important opportunities to cultivate friendships your first two years if you aren’t even there until Junior year.

- Will be very difficult to gain leadership positions in student organizations coming in as a third year.

So, the reality is, Community Colleges are an invaluable asset to many students, but there ARE downsides. I feel that students are being misled by people on here claiming that there is absolutely no reason to not go to community college.

bd128e,Does anyone else feel like some students make college a lot harder than it really is?,"*So before I go further into this post, college can be super challenging and different schools/majors require a different workload.  I understand that college can legitimately be the hardest time of your life.  This purpose of this post is not to attack or single anyone out.  I suffer from several different learning disabilities and have experienced some of the challenges that many students face.*

In high school, I was a C student at best, and honestly, it was touch and go if I would even attend university.  After hearing many horror stories from older students I entered my freshman year terrified. I thought for sure I would fail every class, but I actually found it to be super easy. For the last four semesters, I have faced some challenging times but nothing on the level that other students complain about. I hear these stories about students staying all night for multiple nights during the week, or stories about students having total meltdowns during dead week and I get a bit puzzled. Like I said above these are all very real valid things that occur on college campuses, but I personally feel like some students make it a bit harder for themselves than it has to be. From my experience, I have noticed that even at my (and a lot of my classmates who I have discussed this with)  worst if we apply ourselves most assignments are very manageable. I feel like the elitist stigma we currently have regarding college creates a lot of unneeded anxiety for new students. Throughout high school, we are constantly trained to succeed at standardized tests that require you to over think.  I think this conditioning is extremely dangerous, and that for a large percentage of students overthinking is actually a bigger enemy to their education than even the most challenging of courses. I made a 19 on my ACT and finished high school with a 2.7-ish. I now have a 3.5 in college, and I feel like not being prepped for standardized testing has actually helped me.  My question here is do any of you agree or have similar experiences?  It has been very hard for me to find students who can relate to my experience.

Edit: I think a lot of the negative comments just read the title and nothing else. I want to state once again that elements of college can be overwhelming and challenging. Struggles and break downs are ALL valid.

f0jb5n,Locked Out of Dorm Building for 5 Weeks Running,"I recently went back to college for some postbacc work and decided to live in the dorms as I never had that experience in my undergrad time. 

Week 1: They told me when I signed up for the dorm, that the system for making ID cards was down and would be back up in a week. As a result, I would not be able to enter or leave the dorm building outside of business hours until the ID system was back up. Ok, seems like that should be something to be fixed faster, but whatever, I don't plan on being out late or super early. 

Week 2: ID card system is back up, I received an ID but they failed to tell me that the system to give people access to my dorm building was down. Maybe one week more until it's up. In the meantime, your Dean has ordered you a mechanical key for the side doors.

Week 3: I run into my Dean, he's surprised the key hasn't been made yet and puts in another request. Housing extends the time for the proxy access system to be back up to two weeks. 

Week 5: Still no key. Door lock timers are horribly timed, 5pm - 10am I cannot leave nor enter the building, and Friday at 12pm till Monday at 10am I am unable to exit or leave. I'm cooped up or locked out entirely on weekends. Housing keeps making excuses, the system won't be working until Spring quarter now, maybe later. Facilities has failed to make a key for four weeks, I've called everyday and asked in person multiple times when the issue will be resolved and they say they can't even find requests. 

Beginning Week 6 (Present): I'm not sure what to do now, I've been getting along, waiting for friends to get out to let me in and out (every entrance is electronically keyed for entry and exit). I've personally spoken with the Housing Director twice, two different Deans multiple times, and the Facilities Managers and not a single person is able to help resolve this problem. 

It snowed recently and was unable to get into my dorm when the door timer switched early and was left outside, no jacket in the snow for 30 minutes with some groceries while waiting for a housing staff to let me in. 

The first couple weeks I could understand the problem and I can spend a couple weekends cooped up, but it's halfway through the quarter and it's frankly getting irritating. 

I've talked to so many people that are literally at the top of the food chain and don't know who else to go to now. Any advice on what steps to take next?

Edit: The facilities manager finally produced a key for a side door for me today that can be used at anytime. I will be talking to the Housing Director about a partial refund for the time I was locked out/in as some of you suggested.

bshsfn,My grade went from an almost perfect A+ to a D within two days...,"I had an A+ for a graduate-level computer science course for 13 and a half weeks. We're assigned a couple of easy assignments for the class. I'm talking, 2 hours of work for an easy A+ on the assignment. The professor says that it is due at the end of next week (As in, the end of finals week)

&#x200B;

I have a lot of classes and a lot of finals, multiple back to back and classes I need to do well in, so I spend all my time studying. I'll do that homework Friday afternoon, as I have 3 back to back to back finals that day, including this computer science course.

&#x200B;

So I take the exams, do the homework, turn it all in, and go about my day.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, my final grade comes back as a D. Apparently 'end of finals week' meant 'end of this class', as in friday morning. I missed 15% of a final grade of piss-easy homework because of this.

&#x200B;

Perhaps more annoying is that, despite the final, being worth just 10% of the final grade, and 15% of the final grade being lost, I'm somehow at a D. Even if I got a 0 on the exam, I would still have at least a C. The professor is not replying to emails, since they're moving to a new college this summer.

atmh8q,What to do when a professor refuses to accommodate student disabilities????,"I have a learning disability--I have a pretty severe stutter and an auditory processing disorder, so I go through my community college's Disability Center to get academic accommodations that allow me:

\*extra time on exams

\*a note-taker

\*recordings of lectures

\*reduced weight on public speaking assignments (because of the stutter)

&#x200B;

I have a professor who has completely refused to accommodate this. No extra time on exams because... Idk, she just likes making arbitrary rules. No note-takers because ""your notes should be your own"". No recordings of lectures because ""I don't want to be put on Youtube"". No reduced weight on public speaking because ""your professors at four-year universities won't cut you any slack"". 

&#x200B;

So, she's giving me Fs on everything. I have not been understanding things in class because I don't have note-taking assistance or recordings of the lectures to refer back to (if a professor is iffy on one, they usually allow the other and so I at least have ONE method of self-help). I filed an exam request at the Disabled Center anyway, and she wouldn't sign it, so I got a C- on the exam. I knew all the questions, I just felt so rushed, I couldn't do my best. And I've failed a public speaking assignment BECAUSE of my stutter. 

&#x200B;

I dropped the class, resulting in a W on my transcript. I'm kind of pissed because that W might hurt me when I go to transfer to a four-year university or apply for grad school.

We picked the topic and had to make a at minimum 5 page paper using 4 sources (1 having to be a psychical book) that we found. 

The papers were assigned at the beginning of the semester and we were allowed to resubmit the paper to get a better grade (if we chose). Last week on Monday I submitted my copy of the paper to see what my professor thought and to see what needed to be worked on it. He handed back papers yesterday (Monday the 15th) and asked me to stay after class to talk with him, I am doing well in the class (B/A or 3.5) so I didn't think anything of it and that maybe he just wanted to discuss a critique in person to get his point across. 

He handed me my paper and said ""the language and style you used in this paper is not something I normally see out of a college student, like this wasn't typed out by a person if you know what I mean, it doesn't feel or look right to me, I am not going to jump to any conclusions but my two thoughts are either you plagiarized this paper or your a really above average writer."" I was shocked, speechless actually. Some backstory (if this helps at all) I wrote a another paper for the same class and professor earlier in the semester and got a 4.0 on it, same language of writing, same style of writing, same everything. 

He gave me the paper back and said ""here, look it over and see what you can do to it, I don't really want to report you for plagiarism or give a 0 for this assignment.""

I took the paper back and took it home with me, stared at it and was just like ""what the fuck was that?""

I reviewed the paper for plagiarism on Grammarly and it came back with a 4% match, I am so confused now.

bhae9u,Am I wrong for not wanting my roommate to have his boyfriend over the room during finals week?,"Just for background, my roommate went through a rough breakup over the summer, and it truly brought out the worst in him. He skipped class in order to sleep in all day. He self-harmed. He became desperate for companionship and tried to pursue relationships not only with borderline strangers, but also members of our close-knit friend group. All in all, it was a very uncomfortable thing to witness all year.

&#x200B;

Recently, he's met a guy on Tinder from the next state over, and things have been moving fast for them. They're planning on meeting up, barring the difficulties that come from the fact that neither of them have cars never mind their licenses. Overall, I'm happy for him, if not for one thing; numerous times when they call, my roommate has repeatedly said that they're guaranteed to have the room to themselves whenever they want, and that he has no issue kicking me out.

If it were at any other point in the semester, I really wouldn't mind and I would happily give them their privacy. But this upcoming Monday marks the first day of finals week.

czw2s3,My Roommate Keeps bringing over a guy and it’s too much now..,"Okay so to basically sum up how this started, the first time she brought him over was apparently to do some kind of interview thing for one of her classes and she had asked me to leave, but it was more along the lines of “yeah, you’re going to have to get out soon”. I didn’t care at first since I was going out to eat with some kids on my floor in my dorm, but when I got back to the room at 2am he was still there..asleep on her bed. 

I didn’t exactly shrug it off and expressed my concerns hoping I wouldn’t have to have another situation like that...until the next day when she brings him over again while I’m trying to help a friend with some chemistry work and guess what, he slept over again. This is two times she’s brought him over without letting me know and with no time to prepare I couldn’t find the right time to go shower or get changed. I told her once again if she could let me know when she is bringing people over. She said ok.

Tonight though.. I walk in and see him shirtless getting a massage from one of her friends while they talk about having a threesome but she said she wouldn’t because she’s una loyal relationship. I was hoping they would leave after watching the movie so I could finish my work but..they’re sleeping over and this is now the 3rd time in a row that she has let this happen without telling me ahead of time that she was having people over, sleeping over at that. And now there is a shirtless guy that I’m not exactly comfortable with because I don’t know him in our shared room and another girl in the room as well. I’m fed up with it and I don’t know where to go from here.

f4q01k,How to deal with roommate with opposite sleep schedule?,"I'm a college freshman, and I was randomly assigned a roommate at the start of fall semester. We hit it off really well and were good friends. Both of our sleep schedules lined up and it was really easy to talk to her. A few weeks in, though, she deferred for the semester. 

I was assigned a new roommate (RM) a few weeks later, but we have nothing in common. She likes to go to bed before 10 PM and wake up at 7 AM to exercise, and I go to bed at 2 AM and wake up at 10 AM for my classes. She's also a really light sleeper, so even when I enter and get ready for bed as quietly as possible, she still wakes up a little bit. RM already wears ear plugs and an eye mask to bed. Sometimes I ask her if I'm being too noisy, and she says that I'm fine, but she'll also shade me and can get passive aggressive. 

A few days ago, I set an alarm for 7 AM since I had to go to an event for a program I was in, and RM yelled at me. She was like, ""OP just get up because its not fair that I have to wake up to YOUR alarm."" I was really surprised because she yelled at me the minute I opened my eyes, and it wasn't what I was expecting as soon as I woke up. I was also a little confused because I know RM usually wakes up at that time so I didn't think it was a problem because it'd be like we were waking up at the same time. RM also never let on or mentioned that this was a problem before so it kind of came out of nowhere. She was very harsh, so I avoided being in the room for the rest of the week. I did set my alarms later and more quieter though, and RM seemed to be fine. 

However, I'm in the process of pledging, and I had to wake up at 3 AM for a pledge activity. I connected my phone to earbuds so that I would be the only one hearing it, and I turned down the volume and put my phone right next to my head so that it wouldn't wake her up. It still woke RM up though, and she yelled at me again. Once again, she was really harsh, and I feel really bad, but I don't know what to do. I'm a deep sleeper so it takes a few alarms to wake me up. I usually don't wake up to her alarms, and if I do, then I fall back asleep right away.

I'm not really sure how to handle the situation. I looked it up, and if I put my phone under my pillow, it increases my chances of getting brain cancer. Plugging in earbuds/Airpods didn't seem to work either. I also don't really feel comfortable talking to or being around my roommate right now.

am3mp6,Can you ask a professor to talk to a student who keeps interrupting class?,"In one of my classes, there is a woman I will call Jane. Jane is in her 60s and is attending classes at my university through a program that allows seniors to take courses for free, basically for fun (they can’t earn a degree through this program). It has been my experience that these students tend to be more talkative and less aware of classroom etiquette, which is understandable because they haven’t been in school in a long time. It has never been a problem for me in any other classes. 

Jane is different. She interrupts constantly. Our professor is laid back, he tells lots of jokes and anecdotes and allows open discussion. But she cuts into literally almost every sentence he says, she interrupts other students when they are talking, she completely derails conversations with her own unrelated stories or questions. She makes inappropriate jokes while the professor is trying to teach. She “whispers” very loudly to the students around her during lectures. She’s not being malicious, she just doesn’t seem to understand when it’s not appropriate for her to be talking - she thinks she’s the class clown making everyone laugh with her outbursts and jokes but they usually just make everyone annoyed and uncomfortable (for example, she makes many jokes about finding the young black men in our class to be really hot every time they talk - she’s an old white woman). She’s very disruptive and the class is moving at a snail’s pace mainly due to her interruptions, but shockingly the professor has done nothing other than shoot her annoyed looks from time to time. 

Sorry for the long background, but my question is, would it be wrong for me to ask him to talk to her? She’s not just annoying me, she’s actually hurting our ability to learn in this class. Other students have been complaining about the same things. I’m not saying she shouldn’t be allowed to join discussions or ask questions, I just want him to ask her to tone it down or be more considerate about how much class time she takes up/allowing other students to talk. But I don’t know if that is inappropriate or if it would make me an asshole. I don’t want to form a bad reputation with this professor. Should I talk to him or just suck it up?

9vm27o,My Grades Do Not Reflect My Effort or Confidence,"Midterms absolutely rocked me. I was an A+ student in high school. I was going strong with all my projects, homework, lab reports, etc. I studied hours every day. I went into my midterms with complete confidence. But two of my midterms were shockingly below average. A 71% in Calculus and a 64% in Chem. It's not an unfixable situation, but I don't know what I did wrong. Walking into and out of the exam room, I felt completely confident in getting an A. I had studied a week in advance for both tests. I went into office hours frequently. I pay attention during lecture. I do the homework. I don't understand what I did wrong?

I'm not asking for a miracle solution. I just want tips from people who may have been in the same situation.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who gave helpful comments (which is just about everyone). I'm writing down everything you guys are telling me and preparing for my Chem midterm next week.

Edit #2: I took another Chem Midterm and got a 90. I took a lot of the advice on here to heart. I prepared a week in advance, so I had questions for my recitation teacher. Then as it got closer I began a study group where I taught other students in my dorm who were also really struggling. The last step was just hard studying.

All y'all need to do with orientation is:

1. Grin and bear it. I know it's stupid. There are a bunch of people in charge who have no idea what a good time looks like. Many of them are parents with kids 7 years younger than you, and they seem to think what their 11 year old finds fun is a good idea for you. Sound like what you experienced today? They do all this to make the main purpose (unsuccessfully) more palatable:

2. Get what you need out of it. Walk around with your group and get acquainted with where you will be spending the next few years of your life. Ask questions when you can if you have them (and you should). Ask how long it takes to get from your first class to your second class on the other side of campus. Ask about what you need to know about parking your first few weeks (it will be terrible). Get familiar with how the rooms feel. Are they cold? Bring a hoodie your first day. Are they burning up? Still bring a hoodie, they may crank the AC. Ask the hours at the gym. If they don't mention a campus app, ask about it. 

3. Everyone was there today for #2. You are as likely to make awesome friends during orientation as you are in the line at a  Starbucks you visited once. It's possible, but unlikely. People are too focused on #2 and being forced to do #1. Time for interactions will come soon. ",2019-07-26 09:30:51

That way I could bring only the notebooks and folder for classes I needed that day; no extra weight carrying other subjects along with me.  I rewrote class notes each day and inserted the new notes into the 3 ring folder. Original notes went into a thick 5 subject 3-ring notebook that I kept at in my dorm room. 

Laptop in case the professor walks you through online communication.  

Pen, mechanical pencil with HD lead and a good eraser, highlighters.  Buy a pen that you really like so writing is enjoyable.  Ballpoint is your best choice because other inks run when they get wet. 

Keep a couple of granola bars in your pack. Some days are more hungry than others.  

Some classes do best with handwritten notes. Mine were anatomy, physiology, chemistry, math, physics. 

Practice walking the route between classes for each day (including going into each building to find your classroom) before school starts.  

Get to know your professors even if you are shy. Stop by office hours just to say hi, introduce yourself and what class you’re in.  Use office hours to get questions answered or information clarified. It’s ok to be shy.  

Look classmates in the eye and say hi. Make friends. Exchange phone numbers.  Later, make a note in the contact about what class you know them from. 

Anxiety management: 
As much as you can, make your schedule so you have a break between classes.  Use that break to sit down and copy your notes over again. Use stickies to write your questions on.  (See above)

Find your classrooms inside the buildings before Day 1. 

Your school probably has free tutoring. Ask your instructor about it at the very beginning of classes.  The time slots fill up fast, and you might miss out if you wait. 

Make a paper master calendar of exam dates and when things are due so you can glance at it to make your plan of attack.  Photograph the master calendar.  Make a photo folder for each semester.  Add to it as needed. 

Look online for your syllabi. Print them. Make notes on them.  They go in the folder. 

Start early on projects, papers, and studying for exams.  If you wait until the last few days, you will get stressed and tired.  It’s not worth it. 

Eat well. Crap food is not your friend.  Stay well hydrated. 

Sleep on a schedule.  

Breathe very deeply and slowly to destress.  

Exercise daily. It matters to your mental and physical wellbeing. I don’t mean walking around campus to classes.  

Expect every electronic device you have to die at the worst time. Hardcopy is your friend.  If you don’t back up your phone and laptop, the chaotic results are your own fault.  

Laptop:   Save, and save often. 

Save EVERY piece of paper and electronic file you are given by any professional at the school until that school year ends.  If needed, just throw it all into a box or electronic folder. This will become more important as you get into your major classes. It can save your skin.  

Have fun, work hard and smart. Congratulations on being the first in your family to go to college! ",2019-08-26 06:55:11

What is your guys experience with money in college?

But that's not really the case. I would feel fine spending more money if I knew the intrinsic value and return on investment is good on whatever item I am purchasing. As a college freshman who lives in NYC (where everything costs more than usual), I'm trying to become more financially literate and a more frugal person.

I try to eat in my school's cafeteria as much as possible (meal plan). If I do decide to go out to eat, the appetizers are much cheaper than main meals. I would also pay for these meals with a credit card that has 5% cash-back rewards. I also have a stainless steel water bottle that I refill (it saves me roughly \~$100 on plastic water bottles).

I keep the majority of my cash invested in the stock market so that it grows over time. But since it's invested, it's a little harder to get access to it. Therefore, I keep just enough money in my checking account (where my cash is more accessible) just in case I need to make a purchase. My bank rounds up each debit card purchase to the nearest dollar and stores the extra change into a savings account that earns interest on it. I also have a high-yield Roth IRA that I contribute to $100 to every month :)

I'm currently becoming a better student academically so that I can apply for scholarships, grants and other types of financial rewards to help with college tuition (it's roughly \~$10k/year at the school I attend). I currently have subsidized loans, grants and scholarships to aid with college tuition.

To give some idea of how I was raised, my parents (who are now divorced) were lower-middle class when I was a kid. I've learned a lot of lessons on how money works and how I should view it. Over time, one parent climbed the ladder and is now financially very stable and is living comfortably. My other parent is now what society would consider ""middle class"". ",2020-02-09 23:51:04

g9nycy,Professor not answering any emails for over a month,"I’m in an audit class where 30% of the grade was a group project.

So I desperately need my professor to assign an alternative solo project. One of my friends is in the exact same boat, MIA and unresponsive group mates. He said he’s been emailing the professor for 5 weeks now and to let him know if she ever replies to me. 

I first emailed her April 15, explaining my situation. But of course, I did not receive a reply.  I went on blackboard and left a message for her in the discussion board where i saw another student telling her to check her emails. Then i checked my syllabus and realized she had another email. So I emailed her at that address on April 23. On that same day I decided to also email the chair of the department who’s also a professor of mine this semester. The next day the chair replies and says he was just in a meeting with her and that he knows she’s okay so he’s going to forward my email to her. Still no reply. 

She even uploaded an “attendance” to blackboard and I filled it out telling her to contact me back. She sent out an announcement saying she’s been taking online classes to learn how to teach online for the past 2 weeks and that she’s going to hopefully get back to what we’ve been emailing her about soon. There’s 3 weeks left of the semester. I really don’t know why she felt like she needed to learn how to teach. We don’t have any live lessons with her because she “hates the way she sounds on camera” so she uploads random notes every 2-3 weeks and we’re supposed to learn that way. 

I’ve been so stressed and anxious because this is my last semester and I’m about to fail a class because my professor won’t reply to her emails and assign an alternative solo project. Last night I drafted another email wherein i included my first 2 emails with time stamp and I sent it to both of her addresses and copied the chair of the department and the dean of the business school. The chair replied saying “I’m rying to get in contact with her...” 

I really don’t know what to do anymore and what can be done if i do fail this course. I’m at my wits end and is starting to wonder if I should call a lawyer in case of the worst possible scenario...

Please let me know if you guys have experienced anything similar and what I should do. Thank you :(

I sit in the front row, so he will randomly walk over and stare down at me, or just stare at my desk. It is for an uncomfortably long time, and I don't even know how to react. Two other students in my class even commented on it to me, so they've noticed it too (although they find it funny).  I am the only student he calls on (when I don't have my hand raised) and he seems to take joy in humiliating me when I don't know the answer (in a lighthearted way, but it's still embarrassing)

He has stopped me after class & asked me to come to office hours three times, even though I have a 93 in the class at the moment. I went one time, and he asked me questions about my family and life..as if it was some social hour. He also compliments my work and writing all the time, even though I'm not the greatest student. He used my last assignment as an example of ""excellent work"", even though I wrote it right before class lol

He sent me an email saying that his disabled mother has the same name as me (Gabriela) and he used to call her ""Ella"" when he was younger.

Most faculty will assign groups or at least break them up frequently, so you have to work with different people over the course of the semester. If you didn't talk, you wouldn't earn points for group projects, participation, etc.-- and it would be seen as very odd. Many classes will assign group projects that have to be completed outside of class as well, so students end up meeting in the evenings or whatever.

When I was a student I made friends in my dorm and in classes. At smaller schools (where classes are usually <20) it's commonplace for people to make connections in class since they are working together often. At big schools (classes of 50-500+) it's of course much easier to just sit in back and ignore everyone. But if you never talk to anyone, what do you do if you have to miss class for some reason? Just go without notes? Faculty at my school just say ""Talk to a classmate to see what you missed"" if you were sick or had a conflict. ",2019-05-06 09:22:35
bbzxxa,UNCOMMON college tips for continuing students and incoming freshman/transfer,"So I know there are a lot of post that give tips about college, academically and socially. A decent amount of those post mention a lot of the same tips/advice. After almost getting done with my junior year of college I thought I shared some tips that I don’t see on here often and just stuff to expect that most people wouldn’t(applies mainly for incoming freshman or CC transfers to uni). If any of you have any tips that aren’t super common, ex; joining clubs, studying, don’t skip class, etc., definitely comment to help out others.

1. Making a legit calendar or journal that you plan to follow saves so much stress in the long run. I see people with planners a lot but they mainly just use it to write down as a  “what to do” when ever they plan to do assignments, studying, etc., If you actually sit plan specific date and time for certain things college will go very smooth. This helps me mainly because I work and am a dj outside of college. My schedule gets crazy and I used to stress but immediately when I started doing the date and time process, things got so less stressful.

2. It’s okay to say “fuck it” a few weekends of the semester and just enjoy life rather than studying or doing college work. This may seem like bad advice but everything is good in moderation. Sometimes you just wanna say screw it and lounge around all weekend or go hang with your friends all weekend. As long as you don’t have a midterm or a major exam early in the next week, I think it’s okay and healthy to have this mentality here and there.

3. Greek life is not what everyone thinks it is.... this one is pretty common and everyone really does have their own personal experiences with fraternities/sororities so I’ll just say that Greek life for me personally was a drama oriented waste of my time. I’m not gonna sit here and say their is no benefits of Greek life because there definitely is.

4. This is the main reason I actually made this post but for all of us who didn’t have the “best” high school/past experiences, people end up talking about high school a lot more than you think they would. After being a looser, burnout, Loner type of kid, I was really excited about college because people make it seem like none of that stuff matters. Well when I got to my uni, it was not how I imagined. People talk about high school a lot but it’s mainly because thats their past and they don’t know what else to talk about and you can’t really blame them. People used to tell me “this is just a early college thing”, it’s not I’m friends with tons of upper level undergrad and even grad students that are always bringing up the good ole days. I am left out of many conversations because of this but at this point, I don’t really care anymore because that’s just life. It does suck but you have to get over it at some point.

So that’s it but definitely comment if you have any other tips or experiences that aren’t posted on this sub often. Also feed back would be great especially on 4",college,574,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bbzxxa/uncommon_college_tips_for_continuing_students_and/,False,USA,121,"3.

as3wve,My professor hates me (advice plz),"My biochem lab professor absolutely hates me. It’s a small lab of 10 people and everyone in that lab told me that he doesn’t like me. On the first day of class he screwed up a problem on the board and I raised my hand and asked him why he did it that way then when he explained it I told him respectfully that the way he did the question is incorrect. He did not realize what was wrong so I had to walk him through it step by step on the board, which I get made him embarrassed and look like an idiot in front of the class but it’s not my fault he did the problem wrong. Since that day he has hated me. He consistently grades me harsher than all my peers and takes off points for things that others didn’t lose points for. 

Last week he screwed up an answer key for a quiz and when I told him that the key is wrong and proved to him that my answer is correct he refused to give me the points back, instead he said “I’ll just throw that question out. ” 

On another instance he took off points because he claimed I had not included my pKa value in my notebook, when I showed it to him that it was on the next page he refused to give me the points back claiming that I should’ve circled it. 


Another thing that happened today. He took off points for my notebook because he claimed I didn’t include my data. When I showed him it in my notebook he claimed that I wrote in after he handed back the notebooks. Then I showed him the same data on another page that he had also commented he was like ok and gave me back 1 of the two points. Then I asked why only 1 of the 2 then he said ok fine and gave me back both points. 

He huffed and it was one of the rudest encounters ever tbh.

clwjd9,Is it ethical/legal for a college to create a new required course 2 weeks before someone’s final semester before graduation begins?,"My college added an extra 1 credit course that will consist only of materials to take the college exit exam.

dengsv,Failing my classes and confused about my major/future,"I am currently a second year student at a California community college. I began as an environmental studies BA hoping to transfer to a UC in 2 years. I aced all my classes my first year, falling in the top 10%, taking a few humanities, Bio, Calc 1, and English. Now my second year comes along and I want to switch my major to something more science based since I was never interested in the career opportunities associated with the BA in the first place. I see a counselor and he tells me I will need to take a bunch of sciency courses this year in order to transfer next fall.

So this year I am in Environmental Science, supposed to apply to transfer, and have a course load of Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus 2.  After failing a couple tests and quizzes, I came to the realization that I never had a science brain to begin with. I don’t enjoy nor excel at solving science problems and I have no idea what I’m doing with myself. The idea of studying and saving the natural world just appealed to me. But I have no motivation to study forces, integrals, and orbitals. I enjoy learning about the world from a more holistic perspective. 

I don’t know what to do. I would like to withdraw from all my classes, get a job and come back next semester to take an easier course load but at least knowing what I want to do. But that’s my parents’ money. I’m so scared and confused and stressed. My parents keep telling me to just finish off this semester but I know I won’t do well at all. I need at least a C in my classes to fulfill UC requirements which I don’t think I can do. Any advice will help, I’m extremely stressed right now.

griz1v,College Emergecy Grant for Students,"Hey guys, not sure if many people know this but many schools are offering Covid Grants to students for expenses. I go to a University in Wisconsin, and the school received 7M from the CARES act. Anyone could apply for the grant (simple 30 second application along with FASA if you haven’t filled out). Anyways, everyone that has applied has got 1200$ (max per student). It has nothing to do with what your parents make, its for student expenses. 

So simply do a google search of your college and than include “COVID emergency grant”.

dhzocr,I feel like I’ve been socially blacklisted because people misunderstand my political beliefs,"I’m a left-leaning centrist at a very left-leaning college in Maryland of about 1,200 students. It’s the kind of university that places social justice at the forefront of all academics, is extremely progressive, and favors nearly every socialist solution to today’s problem. It’s totally fine if people believe that. Not only do most of my friends hold these beliefs, I do (to an extent), as well. 


In my opinion, the problem comes when people here (who largely think the same due to the school’s small size) over-generalize a topic/ group of people and/or they don’t take the subject’s nuances into consideration. I completely disagree with blanket solutions and generalizations. I hate it when people say, “x group only consists of socialists,” or “y group only consists of racists.” Politics isn’t black or white—it’s grey. 


I try my hardest to question the applicability/validity of most generalizations and proposed solutions, in addition to understanding right-wing talking-points beyond a surface-level. As a result, I often find myself being the devil’s advocate, poking holes in people’s argument, and/or defending a group of people from over-generalized labels. 


While professors frequently tell me how much they enjoy hearing my opinions (even if I am only playing a devil’s advocate), I know most students really dislike it. And since word of mouth spreads quickly here due to the school’s small size, I believe most students don’t associate with me because they think I’m this horrible person.  For example, I’ve had some of my PoC friends tell me they were told by other PoC students not to talk to me because I’m “a racist fascist” (I’m not at all btw) 


It seems like I’m in a constant up-hill battle to make friends. Nearly no one understands me, and I’m frequently feel isolated and lonely. I just don’t know what to do. 


Does anyone else have any experience with this and/or advice they can give? I’d really appreciate it.


Edit: no, I’m not a conservative. I just don’t think it’s fair to call an entire group of people racists when other factors made them vote for the Republican. I also don’t think socialism is the saving grace people make it out to be. It has its pros and cons, but no one every addressed the cons. So I have to, which people do not like. I never completely argue against an idea—that’s just counter productive. I want people to see a potential downside and/or learn some new info. For example, when people say we need mandatory buybacks on all guns, I’m the person who points out we’ve done that numerous times and it never worked.


Edit II: here’s an example. 
1). Some students were saying colonialism was completely started because Europeans disliked PoCs and wanted to be superior to them. I argued that it started because the Ottoman Empire blocked trade to the East, and the Europeans stumbled across the New World purely accidental.

amqg0u,Fit students: how do you fit in gym time as a busy student?,"I’m a 20 year old guy and I’d like to start building muscle. I was never the sporty type and I was nearing obesity until a little over a year and a half ago, when I started dieting and walking more. I’ve dropped 100 pounds, and now I have a dad bod. I mean to say, I’m very new to all of this.


I have a part time job (~25 hours a week), and I’m heavily involved in a theater club and a volunteering club, which together take up about 10 hours of my week. I’m taking 16 credits, and I’m dumb so I have to study a lot to maintain good grades. Any free time I have is spent socializing or napping.


The gym is 15 minutes away, which means 30 minutes are taken up just by travel. Showering takes about 10 minutes, and if 40 minutes of my day are spent just doing those I’d prefer to spend more than 20 minutes at the gym. Is working out on Saturday and Sunday mornings worth it? Will it at least somewhat help tone my body? Weekends are usually spent just relaxing and studying, but since exercise helps mental health, I can trade out relaxing with gym time I guess.

f23941,The club I'm the president of is on its last legs and I'm done,"I don't really know where to post this but it's a club at a college, so that's why I'm posting here.

I'm the president of a culture club at my college.  The club itself is only about 8 years old, having been started in 2011/2012.  We were never a huge club to begin with, but when I joined in January 2018 it had at least 20-something members.

Since then, though, the number of members has decreased rapidly.  We now have 6 members who regularly show up, including myself and 3 other officers. At my college, each club needs 10 members minimum to not get shut down.

All our efforts to garner more interest have basically gone in the toilet.  Myself and the other officers have spent money out of our own pockets on advertising, and we managed to get around 80 new signups on our school's organization exhibition day.  Guess how many people ended up coming to meetings out of those 80?  10.  How many ended up staying?  0.

Last semester, me and the other officers brought the issue to our club's sponsors, and they were surprisingly nonchalant about it.  They were basically like ""oh, well people are just really busy this year"" like ??? that still doesn't change the fact that we're technically an illegal club and won't make it until next year???  Even worse, we're expected to help with a city-wide festival in a couple of months, and there's no way we can do that with only 6 members.  We'd get swamped.

Me and 2 of the other officers are pretty much done—we've wasted too much time on a club that's going nowhere and is going to get shut down if something doesn't change in 2 and a half months (I'm going to be a senior in the fall, and I could be doing much more important things like studying for the GRE or looking at grad schools).  The fourth officer is the only one who has any sort of hope, and it's really annoying because they're the only one who doesn't seem to realize that all of our recruiting efforts have been exhausted.

Has anyone been in a failing club that either (a) they were able to save, or (b) they had to let go?  How did you do it?  If (b), how did you bring it up to your club sponsor(s)?

EDIT: Me and the other officers came to the conclusion that the club should take a break and not renew for next year. We contacted our club sponsors and they agreed, and suggested that we (the remaining members) join forces with the foreign language & anthropology departments for any events we might want to do.",college,533,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f23941/the_club_im_the_president_of_is_on_its_last_legs/,False,USA,50,"My junior year I was president of a failing club, but then this year we got a ton of new members.

eps7yi,So there’s was this odd kid in my class,"Okay so during my sophomore year (2017) there was this interesting thing happened. It’s not so more interesting but rather weird to an extent I guess. It’s the evening time and I have to go to my game development class. So when I enter the classroom, I see one of my buddies sitting at a computer and I walk to sit next to him. Until that moment, everything else is happening as normal. People file into the classroom, sit down and start talking waiting for the teacher to take roll and ultimately start class. 

So the teacher arrives and starts taking roll. She’s going down the list as normal. When she gets down to a couple of us, she just marks us down since we already had her freshman year. After she gets done, she starts the lesson. At this point the classroom is relatively quite since we’re focusing on the code. Okay so this is where it gets different. For the sake of this retelling I’m going to call the odd kid Billy since I don’t remember his name. So randomly Billy says in an extremely high voice: 

“What size are your breasts” 

The rest of us are just in shock. I try to give Billy the benefit of the doubt. I turn to my buddy and tell him maybe he’s just talking to a friend on FaceTime or perhaps Skype. My buddy says that it’s a low possibility since he’s sitting directly in front of the Professor. 

The Professor responds by saying: “Um, excuse me”. Without missing a beat Billy responds by saying:
“I sAid WhAt SizE ArE UR BreAsts”

At the point there is a couple of faint laughing that is filling the room. The Professor then walks a little bit closer to Billy and says something along the lines of:
“I don’t really think that is an appropriate question to be asking”

He then turns to her and boldfaced says: “I guEss thErE smAll sinCe U DonT waNna tEll mE”. As soon as he says that, we all burst out into laughter since it was just so peculiar that someone could just say that. The Professor then orders Billy to go wait outside until the end of the class that way she can talk to him about his inappropriate behavior. The only problem with this is that the whole class is roughly 2.5 hours long and we were only 35-45 minutes in. 

As Billy is packing up his stuff, he starts mutter some strange things to himself. I guess he thought he was quietly speaking to himself but the rest of us could hear him loud and clear. He started to say that if can’t get his way everyone else would have to “suffer??” and that he wanted to go play bay blades, etc. It was a whole lot of mixed up mumble jumbo. 

After everything was all said and done, Billy left the classroom to “wait”. At the end of class, Billy was of course no where to be seen. The weird thing about all of this was that it was still the beginning of the semester and we still had around 12 weeks left of the class. I wish I could say that was the last weird interaction that he had in our class but it was actually one of many memories that I vividly remember.

fo82p4,Fake Honor Society Scams PSA and how to get REVENGE," Hello everyone, welcome to my Ted Talk. Today I want to educate you on fake scholarship/honor society scams and how we can get back at them for preying on college students. I have been getting letters from honor societies praising me with very generic statements that could apply to nearly every college student. (“This is a rare honor! Only 10% of first and second-year students nationwide have been invited to participate.”) Lies. If they have your information, you will get an invitation. These societies list their “exclusive resources”, like eligibility for more than $1 MILLION in college scholarships, expanding your network, growing leadership skills, making a difference in the world (?) and SO MUCH MORE! All of these “exclusive opportunities” can be found for free by clicking around the internet for a few minutes or accessing free resources from your school or joining student organizations. And of course, they offer the ability to put their society on your resume for future employers or grad school admissions to see. I can’t vouch for them for how these look on a resume, but if I was the one reviewing it, I wouldn’t take it to be a positive thing. 

These scams are meant to manipulate college students into paying their membership fees (usually upwards of $90). If they send out 50 letters to students for $50 and just one of them sends the membership fee back in the enclosed envelope, they are making an easy $40 profit off of an already struggling college student. It’s so morally corrupt, and I hope you agree with me when I say that we should fight back.

If you feel confident enough, pack whatever papers you can fit back inside the envelope and leave it out for your mail carrier to take. This will force them to pay the extra fee for the extra weight you added. Remove any evidence of your identity from the envelope or the papers you stick back into it. Some letters have “personalized codes” for their websites to log into, make sure you don’t send those back. There isn’t much they could do to get back at you, but don’t let them know who you are anyway. Do not tape the business reply card onto a bigger package, brick, etc. or they will be treated as nonmailable and will not be sent. Make sure everything you add can fit into the provided reply mail envelope to ensure they will pay the cost of the extra weight. I typically can fit up to 5 ounces in a small reply envelope and up to 9 ounces in a long envelope. Even if you don’t stick 5 ounces in there, if you simply send them back the materials they sent you, they will be paying twice as much for your denial of their invitation. If 10 out of the 50 people they send a letter to do this, they will be making much less profit and will find it less worthwhile to scam college students out of their money. 

More information on that:

I hope this helped you, and if it did, consider sending a fat envelope back to the next fake scammer honor society that sends a letter to you. If you have anything to add to this or experiences you can share, feel free to contribute in the comments. 

TLDR; If you get a letter in the mail from an honor society, look up their name to see if they are a scam before sending back any registration fee.

I don’t know how long she has left and I won’t be there to spend time with her before she gets worse. I haven’t cried yet but I just feel down and can’t stop thinking about it. I already miss her even after leaving. Any advice is appreciated

f4c83i,How to deal with bad grade on a test.,"Hey y'all. 

So today I took my first algebra test and thought I had prepared really well. 

Our professor makes all the tests untimed and you can go at your leisure (CC). 

I ended up spending two hours and got a 76% :( 

I feel like it's so low and I was really hoping for at least a B. 

How do y'all deal with lower grades on tests than you expected? I feel pretty crappy as I spent a really long time preparing for this first test and I want to get at least a B overall in this class. 

Thanks all.",college,516,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f4c83i/how_to_deal_with_bad_grade_on_a_test/,False,,96,It’s community college. As long as you get a C you’re fine lol ,2020-02-16 01:06:02

I work a full-time professional job and have been taking 12 credit hours every semester and another 4-10 credits over the summer for two years now. Here's what I can tell you:

1. Get into a rhythm. On Monday's I do this, on Tuesdays I do this, on Wednesdays.... Follow through on that rhythm. It's more important than you can understand. You do the project work on the weekend. If you want a day off (*good fucking luck*), know that you are going to have to schedule that in advance.

2. Let the stakeholders in your group projects (shudders) know what your availability is going to be. If you aren't reachable on a time or day, they need to know.

3. Keep your bosses/colleagues/professors informed. I got a free day off because I needed time to prepare a speech. Another professor excused me from a lab report because I had a stupid crazy shitty week at work and could only put together half the work required.

4. Your social life is going to *suffer*. Accept that. Job. School. Friends > pick two

cx286v,What’s the worst professor you’ve ever had? What’s the best?,"What did they do to make them the best or worst?

**edit:** I have another HORRIBLE professor story I wanted to add in.  I was taking a probability class over summer last year and also working on campus.  I ended up reporting my boss for sexual harassment and my department did an investigation and found enough stuff on his PC to warrant him being immediately fired and banned from campus.  The same day they fired him, he was found dead by suicide.  I had a lot of issues handling this, emotionally, and the Dean of Students and campus counseling came to my aid to support me through it.  I was very grateful towards them.  The same week this happened, I had a midterm in my probability class.  The dean personally spoke to my teacher to ask him to be mindful of my circumstances and give me extra time to prepare for the test and to take it later in the week.  He refused, told me to not be lazy and to ""hire a tutor if the class is so hard for you"" and gave me a list of tutors starting off at $50/hr.  I didn't need help studying, I just needed more time and considering I quit my job after what happened, I definitely didn't have $50/hr to throw at anyone anyway..... I ended up getting a C+ in the class and therapy, no thanks to how much of an asshole the teacher was.  I've since told all my fellow math students to not take any classes from him because he has no sympathy for students and he wasn't even a good teacher to begin with.

**worst**: I took a CS - based discrete math course, and the teacher for that was the fucking worst. It was a large class (auditorium-sizes class), and so the teacher had a teaching assistant. It became pretty clear early on that she had no like or respect for students and I’m pretty sure she was only teaching because she had to, but she was more interested in her research work. She often rushed lecture, she refused to slow down for anyone that asked (and would openly mock them for asking), and she was very unforgiving with grades. As in, if a problem was a multi-parter with parts (a) to (d) and you partially got (c) incorrect, the entire problem would be marked zero.  At the first midterm, she started the test by saying she put some common mathematic formulas on the back of the exams for “all the morons in the room who never bothered to learn basic math”. I left that test, reported her to the CS department, and dropped the class. 

**best**: On the flip side, the next semester, I took a math-based discrete math course from a strict but very fair mathematician who was very knowledgeable and had a good way to help students understand difficult concepts in more basic terms. I had to work my ass off in that class, but I learned so much and I really respect the teacher.

I ended up switching majors from cs to math/stats, partially as a result of these two teachers.",college,510,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cx286v/whats_the_worst_professor_youve_ever_had_whats/,False,Global,109,[deleted] ,2019-08-29 23:12:23

I'm wanting to do diagnostic sonography.

Now, I'm more like ""oh god. What am I doing, can I actually do this?""

dwse6l,I was Publicly Humiliated by my Group Member,"I am part of an engineering program, first year, but not my first year in college. We had a project to create an arcade cabinet, this project was used to show us how to do minor programming, wiring, building, and using certain machines like a water jet. For this project I was in a group with J, T, and K. It started out well enough, eventually though, T left the program, leaving us to only have 3 group members in a project ment for 4. K and I worked together on the programming, and k helped J with the building. Once I was done with all of the electrical stuff, I also helped J with the building, but J kept complaining that he gets no help. When it came for the presentation at the end, we wrote a final document, and I wrote up most of the PowerPoint. J asked to finish the PowerPoint, and I knew I wasn't the best at PowerPoints so I figured it would be better for our grade. J decided to write in there that I did nothing, he did the whole project, and he berated me for not helping build the arcade cabinet in front of the entire class. I was so angry and betrayed that once our presentation was over, I just left class. 

What should I do? The professor told me that he should have never done that, and she wished she would have stopped our presentation.

I’m so stressed out and despite organizing study groups with classmates I’m doing poorly.

TLDR: if I get a D I can retake the class and possibly get a B the next time with a different professor (The first grade will be dropped)


Update: commonly asked questions
* Can you drop the class? - No it's too late
* Will the grade be curved? - Not according to the syllabus
* Its just a C! get over it - I can't accept anything lower than a B or it will tank my gpa
* How would getting a D help? - If I get a D I will be allowed to retake the class for a better grade
* Just accept the C. - I need a specific gpa for my graduate program which I can achieve if I retake this class and get a B
* it will just average out. - every university is different. my university drops the first grade and only counts the retake on the gpa

My God, none of the classes there were good but night classes had to be the most sad thing I've experienced. Everybody just seems zapped of energy. To make things worst, I took the class that met once a week for THREE HOURS both times!

&#x200B;

And one of the classes pretty much just consisted of the teacher standing up there and talking (it was an intro. to business class and the only tests we had were open-note online quizzes). I pretty much just browsed the web the entire class. The other one was a macroeconomics class (I took AP macro in high school so I guess second time taking it in a way) where we actually had formal tests but got study guides we went over in class. I paid attention more in that class than I did in intro. to business but also spent most of it just surfing the web.

&#x200B;

For the record, I got As in both classes so my grade didn't suffer at all in either of the classes from not paying attention.

The worst was at the end of the macro class when my teacher was like, yeah, the department thought it was important for you to write a research paper to make sure you understand what economics is. I don't understand it and frankly don't really expect you to be able to forecast what's going to happen in economics in the future. So for this paper I'm just going to grade you on your mechanics, spelling and format, sentence flow etc. You need to include graphs but I don't care if those are accurate or if what you write is accurate because I think this paper is silly in the first place.

ee63sn,Need some advice for entering college with a terrible GPA at age 27.,"Hello Redditors.

I'm looking for some advice from those of you who have entered and succeeded in college but had a bad GPA in highschool.

Let me give a little background about myself to help you understand my situation: I have just turned 27. I could not have cared less about school when I was in highschool. This was due to a combination of boredom and not understanding why I was forced to learn things I did not want to learn. Long story short I managed to graduate highschool with a 1.807 GPA on a scale of 4.0 (I'm pretty sure).

As soon as I graduated I entered the workforce. I've done many different types of work; Apprentice electrician, fast food cook, restaurant cook/food prep, laborer, janitor, retail clerk, customer service and even a brief stint as an insurance salesman. 

After years of working either full time or nearly full time I have learned much about life, myself and the world around me. My conclusions from what I have learned is that I need to follow my dream of becoming a novelist while earning a degree that could allow me to do freelance work or a job where I can earn an income while pursuing my dream.

I have been told countless times that I do not need a degree to pursue that dream. I understand that, however, I cannot continue to rely on a $24,000 salary as a 27 year old man with light debt still living with his parents. I want something I can fall back on while I wait for something I write to be picked up by a publisher if it ever does. I also do not want to go into the mills or refineries in Indiana to earn my living. 

What I'm looking for is advice what to do. Should I go to a community college to improve my GPA? Will I need to do an online degree course thing? I'm at a loss and would love for someone to help me figure out my path.

I think despite my great friend group I feel like I'm not ready to spill these emotions about my lack of sense of self to them. And it would feel weird talking to friends from high school, despite still being very close, because they are so far away and doing such different things. I only have my boyfriend who I went to high school with and a close RA on campus to talk to about these problems I feel. I think being over a 1000 miles away from home magnified this disconnect I feel with my home and life before college. My hobbies are also related to the arts which I feel like are taken less seriously. The arts used to be my main source of inspiration and ambition before college and it felt like it was fading after college, but I think I'm realizing that my relationship with the arts is changing and whether I pursue it or not, I'll be okay.

ch8cg1,"[19f] Assigned 3 male roommates for my student living apartment, any advice?","So last night I received my roommate assignment for my student living apartment and I have 3 male roommates (presumably, one name could be female but it's unlikely). The email only gave me their first name and their phone number, so I can't look them up on Facebook. When I was living in a dorm I lived with a good female friend of mine, so having 3 complete strangers be my roommate is a little scary. Luckily I got my top choice of room and floor preference, and I have my own bathroom. We also each have deadbolts on our bedrooms doors in addition to the front door of the apartment.

If I call and ask to be switched to a new apartment with different roommates, it's likely I won't get the room or floor I want, which is really important to me. Because of this I think I want to stick it out and stay with these roommates, because at least I'll have a nice room to myself. And Im either in class or working most of the time, and I like to keep to myself, so they probably wouldn't see much of me anyway.

All this being said, do you guys have any advice as how-to make this living situation less awkward for both me and them? What should I expect from these guys? Anyone else have a similar experience, either as a guy or girl? I'm a bit nervous about the whole situation.

8hx2sy,Finals tips from a senior,"1. Bring healthy snacks with you to the library/wherever you study. I can almost guarantee that you will be there longer than you think you will. Snacks from the vending machine and fast food won’t help you in your long run studying. Unhealthy foods weigh you down and make it harder to focus. 
 
2. Study in the building or even classroom where your exam is if you can 

3. Set a timer on your phone for 90 and take a lap when it goes off. The movement will help you focus more. 

4. You have time for a shower, take one. 

5.  Utilize your school’s tutoring/academic assistance centers. I work at mine, and very few people use it during finals. Go and get help from people who are paid to help you. 

6. Stop studying by midnight each night. If you’re up studying until 2 am with a final the next day, prioritize sleep. You don’t want to cram everything in the night before then fall asleep during the exam. 

7. If you have a cumulative final, make a cheat sheet for each chapter/section on the exam of the highlights of that part. 

8. If you’re in a math or economics course, draw out all of the graphs you know you’ll be tested on.

9. Make a formulas cheat sheet to review right before the exam. 

10. 15 minutes before the exam, head to the exam room. If you don’t know it 15 minutes before, you aren’t going to know it. Take a few minutes to breathe slowly and calm yourself down. 

11. If you’re writing an essay, take the number of required pages, multiply it by 2, then have that many paragraphs. Ex) if you have a 6 page paper on the economic impacts of affirmative action in higher education admission decisions like I did, write out the 10 biggest points you want to hit then add a conclusion and introduction. 

12. Break your studying in to small chunks of no more than 2 hours for each subject at a time 

13. Don’t have more than 4 cups of coffee in a day, you won’t be able to concentrate 

14. If you don’t study well in the library, try an academic building, the clubhouse at your apartment complex, sorority/fraternity house, or administrative buildings on campus. There probably won’t be many people using those spaces to study. 

15. If you have a short answer/essay test, write out notes for all of the questions then go back and do your long written out answer.

f3c5pr,"What do I do ?? Took a 6 wk class, and essentially bombed it. Today’s the final.","I took a 6 week winter class and failed it. Today is the final exam and I completely overslept. It’s worth 20% of the grade. My college let’s us retake the course and replace the grade - which betters our GPA. This class is a prerequisite for the chem class I need. I don’t know if I should go late to the exam take it and fail (bc it’s a cumulative exam that really has me lost), then retake the course next fall when it’s a 16 week course so that I could better understand the subject and be better prepared for the next higher level course... or if I should just not go and fail anyways - just so that I have a better chance at getting a better grade in the fall. This is the second class I’ve ever bombed, I’m usually a A/B student with one or two Cs. What should I do?

TLDR: Should I retake the course over a 16 wk semester, by deliberately not going to the final, or should I go and get a bad grade with the chance I’ll get a C, to move onto the next course even if I don’t think I’ll pass the next class?

Update: So I messaged the professor to see if it was still acceptable to go in late. He replied that it was but that even if I got a 100% on the exam I would still fail and advised me to just take the day off. He’s pretty blunt like that :’) so I didn’t go and will retake the class at a later time.

4wrp56,What I tell incoming Freshman every year: good grades and a party life are not mutually exclusive. The key is your routine & habit (Very long-winded post).,"**Good grades and a party life are not mutually exclusive.**

Since many people are about to go to college, I wanted to share my experience in Undergrad and Law School. More specifically, I wanted to address what I think is the most important thing about university life – **Routine & Habit**. 

I’ve counseled for incoming Freshman for a few years now as a graduate student and I get very positive feed back from the students who follow the advice I am about to give. 

Quickly, I’ll brag. I graduated with top Latin honors with a 4.0 in my major and 3.9+ in my minors. I also went out and had fun and partied 3-4+ nights per week. Senior year I was going out almost every night and traveling every weekend. I had an amazing time at undergrad filled with success, opportunity, and memories with the people who are now my best and life-long friends. Here is how:

 .

1. **Establish A Routine & Study Habits.**

High school and college differ substantially in a critical way – routine. Very few high schools allow their students to create schedules that don’t adhere to their own. Maybe you picked some of your own classes, but most students still went to school every day from 8am to 3pm (or whatever times you did). College is different. You may have 3 classes one day with 2 hour breaks between them and 1 evening class the next. After having spent the past 12 years of your life in the 8am to 3pm school routine, you will now need to find a new routine. This is easily the hardest part and can take nearly a full semester to establish. 

Most freshmen arrive at college and bask in the glory of getting to sleep in late, taking breaks between classes, and not having any parents around to enforce curfews. After 12 years of grade school you’re finally free of that rigid routine and it feels GREAT! I’m not trying to say that you’ve got to maintain that strict rigidity of high school and live in misery every day of college. In fact, I will tell you that establishing a good routine will make your college experience far more fulfilling and fun-filled than those who do not. 

So what does a good routine look like? Some of that is subjective, you need to determine what you prefer. My ideal routine may not sound like yours. But I do say with confidence these three things: 1) Establish a study spot that is not your living quarters; 2) visit that study spot daily; and **3) if you want to be a party person, you need to be a morning person.**

For me, I woke up every day at 8ish and went to a nearby coffee shop/lounge. Every weekday morning for me started with a cup of coffee there and I would prepare, read, write, etc.. for my classes that day or beyond. If I didn’t have any work, I’d try to get a head a little, plan, organize, or find work (clubs, organizations, applications for internships, study abroad, etc..) The coffee shop was my “office” and when I wasn’t in class or at lunch, I was at the coffee shop. 

It took almost a full semester for this to become habit and for me to stop struggling to get up and force myself to go. But, once it was my routine it was like Pavlov’s bell. I was immediately put into study mode because I was in that spot I dedicated only for my studies. This is why I believe a dorm room doesn’t work, because you share that space with too many other activities and this can make it harder to ‘click’ into that study mode when needed. 

**Treat your studies like a 9-5 job** (or 8-4 like I preferred). During the day you’re either at your study spot, lunch, or class. It isn’t as miserable as it sounds. I had friends I’d see at the coffee shop; I’d or lay out or play on the quad during lunch, etc… It isn’t all work, enjoy your day – but remember, your day-time routine is a work routine first and foremost. 

.



**2. Be the master of your class schedule** 

Picking and prioritizing classes can be difficult. Many universities will assign incoming freshmen a ‘core curriculum’ and some even go ahead and schedule your first semester or two of classes. So you’re kinda stuck there, and this section is for all those semesters where you’ll get to pick your own classes. 

The three most important things in making a class schedule, in my opinion are (in this order): **1) The Professor**; 2) The Time/Days; 3) The subject matter. 

*First one is easy* – better professors simply offer a better classroom and learning experience. Look for professors that have high ratings on online ranking sites and also see if those professors teach classes from freshman through senior & graduate level. Getting to take that one amazing professor multiple times throughout your time is invaluable. I had to take through Calc. 2 – so 4 semesters at 1 math class each. Two professors were rated to be easy A’s in the basic class and were rated highly. However, one professor I saw was rated harder but also taught every class I needed. So I stuck with her for all 4 classes; those later 3 classes were so much easier because I was a part of this professor’s continuing curriculum, learned her style, and had built a reputation with her. 

Building a relationships with your professors is something most incoming Freshman find horrifying. I never in a million years would have dreamed of hanging out with any of my high school teachers; yet, by my senior year I knew several professors that I could (and would) get drinks with. Heck, one professor taught a “Lord of the Rings and Political Theory” class Thursday 5-8pm specifically so we could go to a bar and pre-game with him while talking about LoTR. You had to apply to get in and it was a pretty fun time (and I did learn a lot too since he assigned a ton of readings). 

*Second one is harde* – Sometimes you just cant get the classes you wanted; sometimes classes conflict with each other, etc… I only advice a few things here. First, don’t overload and try to do 6 hours in a row. I tried a semester where I did only Tuesday/Thursday classes and had Wednesday and Friday-Monday off. Maybe that’s for you, but I hated it. My ideal schedule was about 2 classes per M/W or T/R block and a once per week evening course, so 5 classes total for 15 credit hours (max at my school was 17 and minimum was 12). I cant recommend the 3 hour once-per-week classes enough. The idea of a 3 hour long 5-8pm class may sound like shit; but, often professors hate going that long (they want to go home too) and it really does make your days feel a lot more open. 

*Third is easy*  - You’ve picked your times, you’ve picked your professors. Now pick what classes fit! I know you’ll be required to take some classes, but work around that and do the best you can to tinker with your schedule until you get what you want. At my school, registration was a mad dash first-come first-serve ordeal. To prepare for this, I’d have several schedules made out and assigned all the CRNs to my copy/paste clipboard (we used banner/banweb/blackboard). Turns out, most of the time the top rated professors are also teaching the classes people want to take; so things work out pretty well outside of required core classes with this method. 

.

**3. **Finally – DON’T LET YOUR FRIENDS DISTRACT YOU!** 
**
Honestly, if you develop a morning routine like I did, this may only rarely apply to you. Most people I knew slept in late, didn’t work between classes, and planned their routines like they did in High school – they saved all their work for evenings when all the classes were done. But night is when all the fun stuff happens, so why save all your work until then?!

As things turned out – I was the bad/distracting influence on my friends. By the time 5-6 rolled around I was done with my work, hungry, and bored. So I’d go around and try to recruit a group to go out and do something. Once you get a couple of people who want to go do something fun, its easy to show up to your friend’s dorm room and say, “hey, we’re going quarry diving, lets go!” Of course they’re going to go because their current choices are to do math homework that can wait for a couple of days or get shit faced and jump off a 30 foot ledge. 

Problem so many Freshman run into is that there is ALWAYS a person like me looking to go out and do something at night. If you’re constantly putting things off to go on adventures and hit up the bars, then you’ll always been fighting to catch up later. There is always something to do and somebody to do it with in college; get your work done, then go play. It’ll make the play all the better without having that stress in the back of your mind. 

I should also note: most of the people I knew thought I was a terrible student and were under the impression that I was never studying/working because they only ever saw me go out at night, the time they used for work. A lot of people do put off all their work in favor of going out, so they just assumed I was one of those kids who was there to party, not study. People I knew for years came up to me at graduation and were shocked to see all the chords around my neck. 

I had friends busting into the coffee shop at 9 in the morning on a Tuesday looking to go crazy all day… like maybe a handful of times over the years… 

.

**TL:DR: Routine/Habit is the most important part of your college experience. Find an ‘office’ to study at and treat your studies like a 9-5 job. Pick your classes to meet YOUR routine and don’t let others tear your routine apart. All the wordiness in this post is mostly explanation and anecdotal stories to illustrate the points better.**

EDIT** These comments are great, haha thank you all, it makes me feel much better.

I’m just really nervous and need reassurance, did I approach this situation correctly? I just finished first year so I’m relatively new to this scenario.

Update: Professor emailed me back this morning saying that Canvas didn’t have an accurate grading system so instead of an A- I’m gonna be stuck with the B+.

cd474c,Can a college professor refuse to grade future assignments?,"OP here. I've been taking an online course to catch up on my credit hours. So my college professor just stated that he will not evaluate my work further and will not grade future assignments. He says that I haven't been listening to instructions, even though I can't even find the instructions. I even asked him where the instructions are because I couldn't find them, but he simply said that because it's an online course, I should be able to do things on my own. He even told me to go ahead and drop the course. I was sitting at a B but because he hasn't been providing instructions my grades have dropped down to an F.

To get an idea of an assignment, I'd even look at what other students would post and try to follow in a related topic in the same format. But the professor stills says that it's incorrect, and gives me a zero but gives the other students a high grade. Like WTF is wrong with my professor?

7hw7wb,Friendly Reminder: Finals are not the end of the world! You got this.,"It seems like every semester at my school, I receive the inevitable email regarding the death of a student. While not explicitly stated, the majority of these deaths, which happen to be near finals week, are suicides. 


Since I became moderator of this subreddit close to 2 years ago, and since I became a semi-active member 3 years ago: I've definitely noticed a trend of negative posts fluctuating on this subreddit, even more so than usual. Many complain about the stress, complain about grades, or complain about life in general around this period of time. For some: Finals have started. For others: They don't start for a while. Whatever the case may be, I just want to remind everyone that might come across this post: 



**You will be okay.**



I have had near mental breakdowns during certain semesters near finals week, have come close to breaking down in tears (I've seen lots of people actually reach this point in the library at my school), and I've had thoughts that are darker than I'd like to admit or be comfortable sharing with a public audience. 



As a final semester senior, I am still here, I am still fine, and literally EVERY fucking time I am done with finals week I get an enormous sense of relief and once I get my grades back I realize finals week wasn't that bad at all- that the stress and anxiety was amplified temporarily- and that's okay.

I bummed around for a while, struggling to find jobs during the recession, and then I decided to enlist. No regrets! Now I'm set up with the post-9/11 GI bill, and ready to pursue a Bachelor's in education. I'm registered for the fall semester and classes are only a few weeks away from starting. I'm first generation for my family, and ridiculously exited. But anxious. 

I honestly just don't really know what to expect. I graduated high school 11 years ago, but got crap grades because I often neglected homework. I never had to study for tests as a teen, I'd always been a good tester and cruised right through. My military job was very technical, and I had to learn to actually study in order to perform well.

amdpjr,"No major feels safe; 26 years old and two years into community college, I still have zero idea what my next step is. (Advice very appreciated)","For context, I'm a woman in my mid-twenties renting a bedroom in an incredibly expensive part of the country, no relatives or friends to fall back on. I'm not here for the cute cafes, I'm here because I'm kinda stuck (no funds to get out) and also because there are a lot of great schools in this area. I go to the best community college I could find, and it has a decently high transfer rate. 

Right now I'm just working through my GE courses, but I'm coming to the point where I need to pick a major--pick a path and stick to it (at least I'd *prefer* to choose one I can stick to). I've considered graphic design, psychology, or just getting certified to be a medical transcriptionist or ultrasound tech, but nothing I feel remotely capable of feels safe. 

In order to make decent money with a psych degree, I'd need to get my masters or a doctorate, which I really can't afford to do at the moment. Even if I had the money, I don't have the *time*, as I work full-time working near minimum wage just to *live* in this ridiculous city. Graphic design, though interesting, isn't the most stable option. A few years ago I'd have been willing to weather the storm, but at this point I'm desperate for something more dependable than contract work. Preferably something salaried. 

(And yes, I know salaried design jobs exist, but just thinking about how competitive and unpredictable it can be makes my stomach turn.)

>**TLDR;**

The more time I spend working toward my BA the more terrified I become. None of us know what the job market is going to look like in forty years as automation creeps in and snatches up more opportunities, and my greatest fear is working my ass off to become financially secure only to get screwed over and reach retirement age without any savings. I already feel like enough of a failure as a 26 year old with no family and $200 in the bank, earning my degree surrounded by rich teenagers who can drop $10 on coffee every day. 

Before you tell me to learn how to code (trust me, I've considered it), I should mention that I'm not at all math minded. Not even a little. I failed fucking *pre-algebra* last quarter because the second we get into variables, everything becomes a jumbled mess; tbh I'm almost positive that I have dyscalculia but can't afford to get it diagnosed. I can't imagine doing too well in STEM, which is unfortunate because it would be a lot more reliable than most other options. 

**Right now I'm REALLY interested in instructional design**. I have a friend in the field making six figures, and it seems like genuinely enjoyable work. I've even built a presentation for a job interview with one of the most commonly used programs, so I'm familiar with the basic mechanics and concepts. 

**I'd love to hear from anyone who might have some insight on/advice for my situation; I've been stuck in the middle of it for so long that I can't tell up from down anymore, and I'm petrified at the thought of making the wrong choice and ending up with a useless degree or dead-end career.**

btxduh,I’m already excited for school to start again,"You always want school to end up but now I want school to start up again. During the summer I move back home 4 hours away from school. I’m working a full time 50 hour job. Luckily it pays really nice, but it’s a lot of hours and a lot of hard work. It has nothing to do with my major since I couldn’t get an internship, and the work is pretty tough. 

On top of the job parents are unreasonably strict, come up with more rules every day, and favor my siblings. They treat me like a middle schooler and not someone half way done with college. 

And I can barely see my girlfriend because she lives back by my college. We’ll get to see each other every 2-3 weekends, but again my parents don’t give us any alone time so it’s just not the same. Luckily there’s FaceTime otherwise I would go crazy.

bjvcwa,I got a 4.0 while taking 20 credits and didn’t hate my life. Here’s how.," 

This is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A’s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. 

&#x200B;

Not trying to “flex” \*hello fellow kids\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \*\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**A Brief History:**

I am a 25 yo female who just finished my “Junior” year of undergrad. “Junior” because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.

When I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. 

In high school, I was one of those “gifted” but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I’m a fucking adult, I’m going back to college, for real this time. I’m going to apply my goddamn self. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**About my degree:**

I’m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of “hard science” classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I’m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). 

This is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I’m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Decision:**

I do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester’s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn’t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don’t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn’t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn’t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**My Classes:** 

I took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you’re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)

I like to breakdown my classes at the beginning of the semester based on how difficult I deem them to be. You can usually figure this out by the first couple weeks of class, or after the first graded assignment. How much work will this require time-wise and brain-power-wise, and how big of a hardass grader is the prof? THIS is a big deal. Once I figured this out, college seemed so much more like a game. I would highly recommend doing this, you can reassess throughout the semester and as you learn more about your own grade in the class. I typically write my courses on a sticky note in order of priority and slap it in my planner. Speaking of which:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Planner set up:**

I need a paper planner. It’s absolutely non-negotiable. I could not survive college without one, and you shouldn’t try to. I bring it everywhere. I’ve tried bullet journaling, keeping a to-do list in a notebook, google calendar- none of them compare to the ease of use and accuracy of a paper planner. A typical week in mine looks like [this!](https://imgur.com/a/r5qhd0i)

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the semester, I write the time every class takes place in my weekly spread A4 Target planner. Then, I go through the syllabus and enter every single thing next to when it is due. For each week of the semester, I have two sticky notes on the page. I do this because inevitably things get moved around. In my photo, you can see that the smaller yellow note is for readings, and the large pink one is my ongoing to-do list. The readings being separate is important because otherwise everything gets clogged up, and I can see at a glance what I need to read (or skim, or pretend to have read). I organize my to-do list by class, and have a section for “life”. The first thing I do every morning is look at my planner, and it’s one of the last things I look at before I go to bed. As soon as I sit down in class, I open it up. When making plans with a friend, I open it up. I can’t overstate this enough. Get a planner and use the shit out of it. 

&#x200B;

**Work:** 

I had the unique situation of not having to work that much this semester. I received a federal grant that paid for most of my tuition, scholarships paid for the rest, and my family helps me out with part of my living expenses. This is obviously not everyone’s reality.

The last three semesters, I have worked up to 30 hours each week, and it really is fucking hard. Working takes up a lot of your time and energy, and I wouldn’t recommend working while taking this heavy of a course load. 

That being said, I did still work. I like working. I like having money, I like the structure and I like having something productive besides school to do. In the past, I was an assistant teacher at a private preschool. This semester, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach at least one 6 hour shift each week because of my school schedule (Fridays off, Thursdays half off). I also babysat a couple of nights each week pretty consistently. This ended up being about 10-15 hours a week of work- an easy couple hundred bucks in my pocket for rent and nights out. The best part about this situation is that if I was really swamped, I could just completely opt out of work or not schedule anything. When I wasn’t busy with school, I could put in a 20 hour workweek. It put me in control.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Volunteering:**

I taught adaptive skiing on Sundays. I ski with an 8-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and it is exhausting, but rewarding. Our days consisted of me chasing after her, singing songs, managing tantrums, and hoisting her up off the snow. I laughed a lot. Despite thinking that I might over-stretch myself at the beginning, this experience was additive to my life. I felt refreshed, motivated, and happy because I had this kind of volunteering in my schedule. I include this not to brag, but to recommend some type of meaningful volunteering or work if you can. If you think you’re too busy to do good things in the world, you’re not. Promise. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Relationships:**

You know the triangle. Choose one: sleep, get A’s, or have a social life.

Here’s the thing. I’m 25. Sort-of non-traditional, but I’m still in my twenties. I still have friends who like to go out, still go to shows, stay up too late, etc. But, my friends are also adults. None of my friends who are nurses, teachers, or baristas want to go out until midnight on a Thursday anymore. None of my non-student friends are free in the middle of the day to go fuck around or distract me. When I tell my friends I can’t come out because I’m studying, they’re not giving me shit for it. 

I still made a point to set aside time on Saturday’s to spend time with my friends. Typically we would ski, go out for coffee, or make each other breakfast.  

Another factor in this realm is my boyfriend. Boyfriend works 9-5, so my motivation to not do any schoolwork after dinner was intensified in order to hang out with my person. Boyfriend makes me dinner on nights that I have class until 8pm. Boyfriend gets toilet paper at the store because I’m stuck in the library.  Boyfriend wakes me up with coffee telling me he is proud of me. Can you tell that my love language is acts of service?

I’m not telling you to ignore your friends if they’re distracting and get a partner who does stuff for you, but to consider which relationships in your life are additive and which are less so. It’s fine to have fun and make memories; you’re in college. But if you say yes to every single opportunity, you will find yourself out of balance.

My point here with relationships is this: make sure the people who love you know what is going on with you. Let them know that you want to hang out, but you’re reaching for your goals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Work Ethic:**

For me, relying on motivation alone has never helped me. I need to “hack” my environment in order to do what I need to do. 

I woke up at 6:30 every single day, including weekends. On weekdays, I would arrive on campus around 7:45 and either go to class or go to the library. The quiet floor or the law library are clutch. No coffee shops, no cafeteria, no house. If there is any ambient noise or people having conversations around me, I cannot function. I am there to do work and focus. If you’re only half-working, you’re spending twice the amount of time on work. I straight up didn’t have the time to only half-work.

In a typical day, I will sit down at a desk, open up my planner and my laptop, decide which item on my to-do list is the perfect combination of “finishability” and time-urgency.  My phone is on grey-scale and I deleted my social media apps this January and haven't looked back. I listen to 432 Hz white noise music in noise-cancelling earbuds. 

&#x200B;

I’m very bad at time. My brain does not conceptualize it passing. I wear a watch religiously, and set timers for everything- Otherwise I get sucked into the hyper-focus wormhole. I set a ten minute timer to get set up and decide what to do, otherwise I will agonize about what the “perfect” thing to do is. Then, I set a timer for 30 minutes, and lean into whatever I have decided to do. After this, I take a break, walk around, take my earbuds out, get some water or coffee, but do not turn my phone back on. And repeat. Before I know it, my work is done or it is time to go to class.

&#x200B;

If I don’t have anything to do, but it is still “work” time, I will research grad programs, apply for internships, go to professors office hours, or read about work that people I admire do. This paid off in the end of the semester, as a professor casually mentioned that I would get along well with another professor in a different department. I meet up with Prof #2, she was impressed that I had already read about her work and offered me a paid summer internship. 

&#x200B;

**Exercise:** 

Exercise is another non-negotiable in my life. I have border-collie level energy. I need to exercise. If I’m feeling overwhelmed, tired, or stuck, a run almost always helps. I lift weights 4 days a week, my routine usually takes about an hour. I either Nordic or downhill ski with my friends on Saturdays, volunteer on Sundays, and have two hours of yoga a week built into my schedule. No exercise = poor sleep = too tired to workout = eat like crap = I can’t focus= I get overwhelmed= whole system falls apart. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What I did that actually helped me succeed.** 

* Campus library is my “office” from 8-5 every single weekday. 
* Paper planner is your BIBLE.
* Delete social media. Turn off your phone. Really.
* Work in chunks. For my brain, 30 minutes with a timer and then a small break is ideal. 
* Prioritize, prioritize prioritize. You’re going to have to bullshit some assignments and toil over others. Make your efforts count.
* If you don’t think you have any school work to do at any given time, you’re wrong. You can always work ahead. 
* Habits trump motivation every time. Motivation wanes, but if you’re in the groove, you’re way less likely to fall behind. 
* Never. Ever. Ever. Skip. Class. 
* This seems obvious, but do every single assignment and every single extra credit opportunity, no matter how minuscule or annoying. 
* Support system. Tell your friends & family what you’re trying to achieve and let them know how they can *help* you.
* Don’t forget to feed yourself and exercise.
* Set aside intentional time for non-school. Ideally a full day on the weekend. 
* Say no. Say NO. Explain yourself, be kind, but say fucking no. 
* Nobody is productive every single hour of every day. It’s ok. Perfect is truly the enemy of the good. 
* Have an end goal. Visualize walking at graduation. See your GPA climb.
* If you’re a non-traditional age considering going back to school- do it. School is infinitely easier with an adult brain, adult friends, and adult priorities. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, if you fucked up this semester, its ok. It really is. I’ve been there. My sophomore year, I ended the spring semester with one D, two Cs, an F and a W. It doesn’t feel good. Just remember that it doesn’t say anything about your worth as a person. Beating yourself up about it isn't going to help in the long run. You are not forever the person who fucked up, and you can use what you did wrong to learn and grow and change. 

Also, remember that succeeding and trying your best doesn’t have to be miserable. You can still enjoy the things that bring meaning to your life while trying to do something difficult.

TLDR: I got a 4.0 while being busy. It didn’t suck because I had a perfect storm of mindset, abilities, organization, and circumstance.",college,446,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bjvcwa/i_got_a_40_while_taking_20_credits_and_didnt_hate/,False,,49,Fucking Chad omg ,2019-05-02 22:07:55
8222mf,I would like to warn you about the possibility of post-college depression. I wish somebody had done the same for me. [Semi long],"If you grew up anything like me, a large focus from age 5-18 was the prospect of going to college. Teachers at school would often talk about it. Parents would start to ask you around age 14 which college you'd like to attend. Your parents' friends ask you if you've made your decision and what your major will be. You make your decision. You leave your crying mother in the car as she drives away after dropping you off freshman year. You change your major. You change it again. You revert back to what it was originally. Graduation day comes, you did it! You passed with flying colors, barely scraped by, or did somewhere in the middle. Selfies with your friends group abound at graduation, all of you swearing you'll remain bestest friends for forever until the end of time, no matter what. Now, you're 5 months post-graduation working your 9-5 and it hits you. ""Man, this *sucks*"". What happened?

While it's impossible to nail down specific causes of this phenomenon for everybody, what I can nail down are some near-universal truths that I've came to realize in the 5 years since I have graduated. 

* Number 1: The lifestyle change can be very jarring. 

I can't remember where I saw it, but somebody said ""College is a weird time in your life because you're effectively an unemployed alcoholic but your parents are still proud of you"". I went from not worrying about having to pay for bills, being surrounded by friends, going to one three hour lecture every other day (rest of my classes were online), and partying every weekend to busting my ass at a ""grown up"" job in a new city with very few people that I knew. Post-college can be extra hard if you move to a new city where you don't know many people or if you go to a familiar city but your friends have all moved away. College is something that is so built up for so many people that once it has came and went, the smile quickly fades as you ask yourself ""So I have worked my whole life up to this point for this moment and now that it's over, what do I do?""

* Number 2: Maintaining friendships after college is much more difficult 

When you're in college, all you have time to do is study and hang out with your friends. You have thousands of people around your age that you have something in common with. A surefire way to introduce yourself is to ask somebody what their name and major are. Easy, right? You don't necessarily have this luxury post-college. 

When you graduate from college and move away from your friends, life tends to get in the way. People get boyfriends and girlfriends. People have babies. People get busy with their careers. People find other groups of friends in their town to hang out with. In college, you may have hardly had a choice *but* to make friends. However, afterwards, maintaining friendships can take *a lot* of work. If you're not careful, you can slowly fade away from people who you thought were going to be your life long friends and that can leave you feeling destitute. 

* Number 3: You change A LOT in your 20's (most of the time)

Most people will go to college starting around 18 and graduate when they are 22-25. Zach Braff, who played John Dorian on the TV show ""Scrubs"" has a very profound quote that I agree with whole heartedly. He said ""‎""I have this theory that your body goes through puberty in its teens, and the mind goes through puberty in your twenties."" In my experience, that is SO true. You'll be constantly changing and evolving as you progress through your twenties, your mind catching up with your body. They say that your brain isn't fully developed until you're in your mid-twenties, and I for one can attest to that. As a 26 year old, I am NOT the same person that I was when I graduated a few years ago. I have evolved mentally, physically, and emotionally into a man that any parent would be proud of. However, that comes with a lot of perspective changing and lifestyle-alterations. 

* Number 4: You might realize that the field you selected to study is not the one for you. 

I spent years trying to make law-enforcement type jobs work for me, as a Criminal Justice major (hint; DO NOT STUDY CRIMINAL JUSTICE. Minor in it if you must, but major in something that will give you hard skills such as computer science or accounting). Corrections Officer. Private Investigator. Loss Prevention Detective. I jumped from one position to the next before I came to the conclusion that this field was NOT for me. This depressed the shit out of me because I felt like I was stuck. I did not have any hard skills to show and I was desperate to get out of the field. I remember flying home to visit my parents about 2 years after I graduated. We went out to a Mexican restaurant and I cried at the table because I was so hopelessly destitute about my job situation at that time. Now, through careful maneuvering and by going back to school, I have successfully transitioned into IT and I love it. If you do not like where you are career-wise, change it. It sucks having to start all over again from the bottom, but I am a hell of a lot happier than I was making 3x what I'm making now. 

As I said in the title, this is a story of the *possibility* of post-college depression. I do realize that many people will not experience this, but many people who I have spoken to about the matter have, including myself. 

The very very TL;DR of this post is that life after college is depressing and takes some adjusting to, friendships are something that you have to work at to maintain, and if you find out your major isn't for you, take steps to get out of that field. 
",college,445,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8222mf/i_would_like_to_warn_you_about_the_possibility_of/,False,,50,"It's a good warning. One of my major criticisms of most colleges is that they simply don't teach the hard skills needed to get and keep a job.

Go into K-12 teaching? No credential program in my state is going to include a class on Education Law, something that is vital for all teachers to know in case a parent or your boss is out to get you. (That really happens in schools. ""I hate Ms. ____. Let's find a way to get rid of her."") . They also don't include any coursework in the sociology of schools and parents. That topic alone is worthy of at least 3 units. 

The same could be said for many majors. They don't teach you how to make a living at it. They fill your head with knowledge about theories of this and such, but can't help you get a job in your field.

Knowing this, readers, take ahold of your college courses and take whatever you need to learn NOW so you'll be better able to compete and function in the real job market.

9nwzjg,Professor is accusing me of cheating off another student I've never spoken to. Wtf do I do? Online class.,"

EDIT: 
The other student took my discussion board post and used it for their essay. I used my own post for the essay, just added fluff to it. This is why it got flagged as word for word. Hopefully he changes my grade, since I can't control what another student takes from discussion boards that are visible for all. 




----OP-----


I checked my grade on an essay yesterday, it was a 0 and had a comment from the professor ""did you cheat off of x or did x cheat off of you?"" I didn't recognize the name, so I replied asking what they meant, I only used one source for my work and it was the text book given, and I quoted every source. 

Then I looked through the students names and realized x is another student in the online class with me, I've never even replied to one of their comments on a discussion board. 

I emailed the professor again explaining that I don't know the student, and would like to see their work to compare. 

Professor replied with my essay and highlighted a part that was ""almost word for word"" from the other students. And said ""this is not a coincidence""

This guy obviously is not going to believe me, but I know the truth. The other student knows the truth. What can I do to get this figured out? I can't fail this class. I don't want to be accused of something I did not do, especially when it's plagiarism. 

",college,442,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9nwzjg/professor_is_accusing_me_of_cheating_off_another/,False,,35,"Your best bet is to try to prove that it's your work, not the other students. Helping him to see that you posted this onto what I assume is a class discussion board before any of these essays were turned in will likely help your case.

In either case, the professor *should* have given you both zeroes if he/she was unable to determine who plagiarized. That's the fairest approach to this if they can't pin down who copied the other's work. It's basically in the school of ""either you copied person X or you helped person X cheat"", both of which could be considered violations of academic integrity.

Hope the prof. hears your argument and is willing to give you your points.  ",2018-10-14 04:29:51

dxedxw,How to deal with weed-smoking roommates if you're a wimp?,"I have recently moved into a shared apartment with a couple who smoke weed on a daily basis. Upon viewing the apartment, they informed me about it and made a whole fuss about downplaying it, telling me ""ooh its only a little bit and at night, to sleep better"". I don't smoke weed, tobacco or anything else, don't drink or do drugs, but I agreed to this because they generally seemed nice and, as a foreign student, I didn't have many other options. I also get my own room so I figured I'd always have some smoke-free space behind the door if I needed.

One and a half months after moving in, I can say that, even if I don't really know what is considered ""a little bit"" among smokers, it's pretty much frustrating to me; they don't mind doing it in the shared space, during any part of the day if they feel like it, or if they have some friends over (of which I am almost never informed in advance). They also light up these aromatic sticks and do not seem to think that these strong smells could be a bad thing for anyone in the vicinity. They almost never smoke in their room, and if they did, it wouldn't make much difference since it's not technically separated by a proper wall (it's like a big balcony over common area). Usually I think of myself as having a weak sense of smell, but this shit is messing with my work badly.

And yep, they were the ones who ""got there first"", they're locals and in any situation it would be 1 vs 2 fight. The obvious solution for me would be to leave, but I am locked into the contract for at least half a year. I have no idea how to bring the issue up. After all, technically, they warned me about it right away and I can see that they're trying very hard to act all sweet and nice.

I'm switching to a nursing program and I should be on track to graduate at about the same time I would if I stuck with psych, give or take a few months. Nursing actually excites me and I just feel like it's what I should have done a long time ago. My family is just not supportive of pretty much anything I do (basically I get a lot of ""Why aren't you graduating early?"" ""Why don't you work full time while you go to school full time?"" ""Why haven't you graduated already?"") They put a lot of pressure on me to be like some super human who can finish 4 years worth of college in 1 year. I have told my mom, she's a nurse herself so you can imagine she wasn't mad about it. I live on my grandma's property and she helps me pay for school which is part of why it's going to be a huge deal when I tell her. But, letting her know I'm not the only one will help! I will update this post when I tell her. I'm waiting on a meeting with a counselor to see if I can get into an accelerated program first.

e4fouv,Might be dismissed from the college because of the math,"I've never been in a good relationships with math but calculus did really fuck me in every hole possible.

cf8s7p,I'm an Adjunct Professor and We're Preparing to Go on Strike,"Posting this because I figure it's useful for students to understand how their universities function and because I'd like to know how students would respond if their professors went on strike.

First some background for people who don't know how the adjunct thing operates; you can skip ahead if you're familiar.

Adjuncts are faculty members who work part-time for the university and are typically paid very little, around $3000-5000 a semester for a 3 credit course. There's two main varieties of adjuncts. The first are the Industry Adjuncts -- these are people who've had substantive careers outside academia and are returning to share their expertise. The second are Career Adjuncts -- these are people who want to be professors and start teaching right out of grad school. Industry Adjuncts are typically well off financially from their previous jobs, many are in retirement, and they get paid more for their classes (some getting more than $10,000). This post is about Career Adjuncts -- the people who grind out a living working multiple jobs at once and are hoping they'll eventually get a full time teaching job, even if it's not tenure track. Most of the adjuncts you'll encounter are the Career Adjuncts, they're the ones teaching the 100 level courses and are nearly half the faculty at some universities.

My current pay rate is just over $4,000 per course. So, if I wanted to earn a moderately decent salary of $48,000/yr (with zero benefits!) I'd need to teach 12 classes. A standard full-time teaching load for a professor with no committee or research responsibilities is 6 per year (usually 3 Fall, 3 Spring, what we call a 3/3 load). My university caps each adjunct at only 3 courses per year; if we want to teach more, we have to find other universities to work at.

The head of my department recently decided that adjuncts would no longer be given preference in hiring for full time positions, so being able to use the job as a bridge to a full time teaching career is no longer an option. The department also recently hired so many new adjuncts that it's now difficult for us to even get 3 courses a year and most are going to be limited to a 1/1 load.

We're going to soon be renegotiating our contract with the university, and the university has been adamant about not increasing our salaries (we do get pay bumps, but it's equivalent to a 2% raise, so basically just matches inflation).

Technically, we're not allowed to strike under our current contract. But, the contract says absolutely nothing about what our actual teaching responsibilities are. If the university is unwilling to budge on pay, then we're looking at putting our job expectations on the table. Here's what it would look like:

If a normal work week is 40 hours, and a normal full time load for a semester is 3 courses, then each course is roughly 13:20 per week. Based on our low pay rate though, the university is entitled to only half that: 6 hours, 50 minutes per week per course. Keep in mind that 2:30 of that is already classroom time, with some extra going to getting to class a bit early to set up, and staying late a few minutes to talk to students. That leaves about 4 hours left for office hours, lesson planning, answering student e-mails, writing assignments, grading papers, etc. There's also often faculty meetings which will take up about 1:30 every few weeks.

I teach a small, writing intensive class with about 20 students. If I want to return essays in a timely manner (we're urged to do it within 1 week), I can spend a full 12 minutes on each individual essay, and that's if I do *nothing* but grade outside of class (no lesson planning, nothing). Normally an 8-10 page paper will take me about 45 minutes to grade, and 10-12 takes about an hour. But, if the university refuses to purchase that service, they may pay for my 12 minute essay analysis which consists of a quick read of the paper, marking any obvious grammatical errors, circling the relevant sections on the grading rubric, and writing a sentence or two in response. This is the course where we're supposed to be teaching you how to write academic essays, and I have to seriously consider eliminating essay writing from my curriculum.

Since we can't strike, our alternative is to provide a bare minimum education.

If you're a student, this should piss you off quite a bit. My university charges about $1,400 per credit hour, so each student is paying $4,200 to be there, and combined the class has a sticker price of $84,000. I see about 5% of that. Realistically, after scholarships, my students are maybe paying $50,000 total, but I still get less than 10% of that.

The sad truth is that you do *not* get what you pay for. You pay the university, and the you get what the university pays for, and the university is a cheap bastard. In order for the situation to get better for adjuncts, we're going to need students to be much more aware of how little of their tuition goes to pay for their education. Also your parents (they're really the university's target audience).

Now just to head off a couple responses I know this is likely to draw:

""If you don't like it, why not just work somewhere else?"" Because I want to teach college students. Getting a job teaching, any job teaching, including shitty adjunct ones, is tough. But that aside, *someone* has to teach the class, and if it's not me, it'll be someone else in the exact same situation. Changing the personnel doesn't change the conditions.

""Why are you taking it out on the students?"" I'm not. I have a menu of services I offer, and the university may decide which they are willing to pay for. It's the university deciding to only pay for a bare bones education while charging top dollar. ...Also, I'm completely willing to take a couple picnic blankets out to the quad to hold lessons and give feedback on essays there on my own time. I'm just going to make sure everyone is crystal clear on what education the university is providing and what education I am providing beyond that.",college,441,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cf8s7p/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_were_preparing_to_go/,False,,148,[deleted] ,2019-07-19 23:16:06

cofn34,Having your bf/gf stay the night in your dorm,"Hello! I’m about to start my sophomore year of college. Last year, I spent a year commuting to a community college so I still lived at home. This year, I’ve transferred to a university and my boyfriend is also going to the same school. It’s a public university so there isn’t any religious restrictions. I wanted to ask if having your SO stay the night in your dorm is a good thing to do. I actually have a single room and so does he so neither of us have to deal with a roommate. I’m assuming that it won’t be a problem since there isn’t any gender restrictive rules set in either of our dorms. Like I asked, I just want to know if it’s really worth it or is it a waste of time and energy?

Thank everyone!",college,438,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cofn34/having_your_bfgf_stay_the_night_in_your_dorm/,False,,60,"\>  is it a waste of time and energy? 

This is actually sort of baffling. Whatever do you mean? If it's a waste of time/energy to be with your SO anywhere, why are you with them at all?  Now if you're asking ""Could it be a distraction that might negatively impact my academic progress?"" the answer is yes, if the relationship becomes the center of your life to the point that you aren't attending classes and doing your homework, but that can happen regardless of where you sleep at night. Another question might be ""Will it be possible to set boundaries if there are no rules around our time together?"" That has nothing to do with dorm life really, but everything to do with your relationship: if you feel like you need/want to maintain some private space/time for yourself, then that's something you need to work out with your partner-- nobody is going to do it for you.

Single rooms are great for people in relationships as they eliminate the need to negotiate with roommates- you can stay over and do as you wish, when you wish. But it's also the case that many young couples struggle to delineate and maintain boundaries in relationships due to lack of experience and maturity...being able to stay together 24/7, have sex without interruption, and enjoy the intimacy that goes with that is wonderful. But it can also quickly become overwhelming, especially to those with no experience managing expectations/boundaries as adults, and that can hurt the relationship as well as your interactions with others. I'd simply recommend that you and your SO have a direct conversation about expectations up front-- who will be staying where which nights, what happens when one of you has another priority (school, work, friends, sleep, etc.), how you will interact with others, and how you will both communicate that you *don't* want to ""spend the night"" when the time for that arises.

f3txef,Academic Dishonesty - Somewhat a cultural thing?,"This is inspired by a post from like 9 hours ago, in which some people voiced the opinion, that studying with the same test bank (which includes the answers) that the professor gets all their quiz and exam questions from, would be considered cheating/academic dishonesty.

I am very careful when it comes to plagiarism, checking everything a thousand times to make sure I cited everything correctly and didn't for some dumb reason forget a footnote somewhere. So, I would generally consider myself (academically) an honest person.


However, I've used exams from a prior year to help me study for upcoming exams (they're available through student unions), some of those were almost identical to those I had to take - which in two cases I had actually been given a heads up for by older students.

I had an oral exam and right after leaving the examination I jotted down all the questions I could remember having been asked and forwarded those to my friends who have to take the same exam (and to another girl who asked me to).

I had to take a test later than everyone else in class because of a stay abroad and a friend of mine send me an approximate overview of the questions in the test. Those were the same questions I got, two months later. I had, before going abroad, even offered my professor to take the test before I would leave and he responded that he'd rather have one person in class knowing all the questions beforehand than having everyone else know.

So, apparently in my country or at least at my university it seems pretty standard to profit off of other students sharing their knowledge and professors being too lazy to change up the questions. Even professors obviously know about it. It's not considered academically dishonest here.

Is it different for you in whatever country you're going to university? Would any/all of my examples be considered academically dishonest?

I understand the material, and I'm not the WORST test taker, I go to office hours, but math just doesn't come naturally to me. I hate being called ""lazy"" for not acing math. I work hard, I have all A's and B's except for my math classes.

Here's my question:

I took piano lessons for YEARS as a kid (parents forced me to) and I was never a natural at it. I sucked at reading music notes (especially quickly), I struggled with understanding the measure and beats and all that (never understood the difference between 6/8, 3/4, etc.), it took me weeks to play a song with only a few mistakes. *I had NO rhythm.* I was never told that I was ""lazy"" or ""practicing wrong"", people just told me that music wasn't for me.

Why isn't it the same way with math?

edit: Got it. Got your DMs calling me lazy, stupid, etc. I get it, I'm an idiot.

I'm so frustrated. My brother, a software engineer, has said ""I suck at writing/English"" forever, nobody batted an eye. My parents love him, yet hate me.

aeiwgp,My mental health is always a mess before every semesters,"Does anyone else experience this?? 

Before every semester, I get this intense feeling of doom. It starts off as anxiety (I’m already medicated for it) whenever I think about college because it stems into a million different thoughts. It gets really bad all day until it breaks and I get a sense of relief

Then something usually happens that comforts me about it all, and I feel really good about it. Then I start feeling really depressed. I don’t really recognize it until I’ll do something to prepare for college (like getting books) and I’ll just start sobbing. I won’t actually be sad or worried, but I’ll start crying a lot. Then it basically happens every day until almost a month after the semester started. 

I’ve tried seeing a school counselor, but they refuse to actually help me because they only want to deal with on campus students and not commuters.

do53nb,Afraid Of Leaving School Janitor Job To Pursue College,"Hello, I am currently working full time as a school janitor, and I have mixed feelings about leaving my job to become a full time college student(Full time in order to qualify for a scholarship). Despite my current job as a school janitor not being my dream job, it's something I've grown to actually enjoy, and I believe a part of that has to be because of the teachers and other faculty members whom I interact with daily.

&#x200B;

On another note, I'm 21 years old, and I've nearly forgotten everything I've learned in middle and high school. I believe I will be taking a placement test for college next year, and will more than likely have to take courses to get me up to speed academically. Should I opt to spend next summer working and save up around 3k, or spend the summer possibly getting some courses out of the way and/or brush up academically before Fall semester?

&#x200B;

Also, I'm planning on attending college to become a highly qualified individual who can one day become an elementary school teacher. :)

&#x200B;

TLDR: It's very bittersweet to leave my current job, and lose my only source of income. It's a job I've grown to enjoy, and having a steady stream of income is nice to have some spending money. I just don't know if my schedule as a full time college student, and recreational hobbies(Lifting and volunteering) will allow me to also hold down my current job even as a part time position.

Absolutely not a scam, and a legitament business. The major difference between Vector and something like Vemma is that with Vector you sell the product and get commission. Vemma you get paid for advertising and recruitment. With vector, you directly sell Cutco Cutlery to the customer instead of having them in the store. 

Let's clear up some misconceptions:

1. You do not pay for your set anymore.  That practice stopped about 6ish years ago. When you paid for your set it was yours. Now the knives are yours and you can buy them from your manager if you'd like, return the set when you're done, or have your manager get charged for them

2. You make money via sales OR per demo. You make 15-18 per demo or commission,  whichever is more at the end of the week.

3. It's a great product with a great warrenty. That being said it is difficult to sell them, mainly because of sticker shock. Shits expensive, yo.

4. You don't get paid for training, but since you're an independent contractor so they don't have to. It's shitty but it's only a day or two but can be done online in a few hours (dont recomend). They do feed you during training which was cool

5. When you get through tier 1 and 2 of your recs, thats when it gets really hard. Tier 1 is friends/family. Tier 2 are their friends/family

I learned a lot about sales at Vector, but it's definetly not for everyone. If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them. I worked there from March 13-July 13. I stopped because i wasn't making enough money. But because I didn't make money doesn't mean it's a scam. It's sales, sometimes you make money, sometimes you dont.

avfpy3,FAFSA questions? Get help here!,"The [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.gov) for the 2019-2020 school year opened on October 1, 2018. If you plan to attend college during the 2019-2020 school year, you should submit a FAFSA if you are eligible to do so.

The 2020-2021 FAFSA will open October 1, 2019.

First time? Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. This is your legal, electronic signature. You cannot submit the FAFSA without one. If your parent already has an FSA ID (for themselves or for other children), they must use that one.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

FAFSA questions posted on /r/college must be in this thread. Standalone posts will be removed.

- If I have no questions for my professor, what am I supposed to do at my professor's office hours? Some people have said just introduce yourself, but I wouldn't this come off as awkward and or a waste of the professor's time if I have nothing important to say?

- How often should I go to office hours, so the professor knows me well? Do I just continuously show up asking the professor random questions about the content?

- How do I keep up a relationship with a professor after I finish their class so they don't forget about me?

- How many of my professors do I need to actually go to? I have 5 this semester, and I'm going to have many more throughout college. I doubt I need to know more than a dozen professors well throughout my college career.

She's not horrible but will constantly tell us stories about her past, how the government is trying to spy on us, completely absurd tangents and this is a math course. She keeps postponing tests and assignments so I feel I'm wasting my time as nothing I do is even graded or noticed. The only grades she has are quizzes that she assigned but all they are just to sign in for attendance. 

Most of the class doesn't seem to care one bit and is on their phones or sleeping. People randomly get up and leave the class 10 minutes in after they sign in, she barely notices and cares. 

I need the class to move on and she is the only prof that teaches it. She doesn't care, my classmates don't care. I've started to join in on not paying attention because she doesn't teach. It's draining on me how I'm the only one in the room that seems to want to be there.

I've tried talking to her privately about this but resulted in her telling me how she once met Johnny Carson. She said she'll pass me and I'll move on, so the fear of failing really isn't concerning to me.

bk3rjn,I lived through one of the worst nightmares a college student could have...,"I missed my final. 

I came into class, after studying for my last final of the semester and came into class early to chat among people - to get some hints and tips. But 5 minutes before class, no one showed up. A thought came to my head, I quickly checked the syllabus, and before I knew it - the final was not yesterday, but TWO days ago.  

Every single professor I've had has split their week in half (going for the latter day) to have their final, so I automatically assumed that my final would be Thursday. So I basically just shit my pants when I found out that was not the case with this class. 

I panicked and walked out of the classroom, emailing my professor - ""Hey, I missed my final. If I can retake it, that would be awesome but if not I respect your decision and will accept my grade""

After shitting myself for a couple minutes, he emails back almost immediately - saying that we'll ""talk"" in 10 minutes, since he was heading there. (Which I did not know, thought class was cancelled).

And, after some consideration, he says that he knows I have perfect attendance for the class and have great grades in it - and he will let me take the final...NO PENALTY. 

I probably didn't do too hot on the final, but it's a lot better than a fucking zero.

In Highschool I was the kid who could get off without studying. 3.8 GPA for the kid who took AP classes, partied, listened to punk rock and showed up late to class.

First semester of college. I get A- in Chem, C in Physics and flat out fail Calculus. Just because of that one stupid fucking class my GPA is below the minimum and now I’m stuck. I got issued an academic warning. My first semester was hard. I was forced to commute to college, I got fired from my job and found a new one. My relationship ended. I had to deal with my group of friends being disbanded. And I lost my burning motivation for a split second to keep working out. I didn’t party or drink at all. I showed up to class and did the homework. Guess it wasn’t enough.

Now I’m waiting on an email from my advisor on what to do and what the consequences are.

My game plan for the next semester given they let me continue to take the next sequence of classes, is to cut down the amount of Xbox I play, go to office hours and actually do the problems on the homework. I tried. I really did. I don’t understand I see all these memes and tweets of people praying they pass and they do, but here I am, actually giving it my best, and I fail. I’m hurt and scared.

guyrwk,Some tips for the (unwilling) Commuter/Hometown college student,"I've seen many posts providing advice for many types of students, from freshmen to graduating seniors, passing by pre-meds with low GPAs as well as aspiring bankers from non-targets. I haven't seen too much advice for those who are going to have to stay in their home town for college and aren't happy about their decision.  I'm an incoming senior at my hometown college and I figured I'd provide some tips to those who are commuting yet do not want to stay in their hometown post-graduation.

This isn't advice from a social standpoint (parties, Greek Life, etc.). This is more-so professional/career advice for those who want to make it a point to leave their home town by the time they graduate.

*Disclaimer: People attend hometown schools for various reasons. I can't assume everyone's reason nor do my privileges and circumstances apply to all. I'm also a Canadian, if that changes anything. Also, if you desire to live and die in your home town, that's 100% understandable but this isn't advice directly meant for you. Don't take this as a condescending perspective or an attack on your goals.* 

&#x200B;

1. Use internships to leave your home area. Whether you land a summer internship or you take a break to pursue a fall or winter co-op, internships in other areas will be your best bet when it comes to both leaving your home town temporarily or even permanently post-graduation.
2. Your environment, notably your family, hometown friends and even your school, will most likely prefer you to stay in your school's area. Nothing wrong against that but be aware of these biases and learn to be resilient and to not give in. Smile, acknowledge their points, and stay focused.
3. No part of the world is perfect. It's very easy to give up on your desire to leave as you hear about cities with high rent, hot/cold weather or crowded/scarce population. No city is perfect.
4. Try to make friends with students who come from other regions. You'll learn about other parts of the world.
5. Appreciate the reality that your career interests will change. Be careful about pidgeon-holing yourself into a path. For example, my school is crawling with pre-meds who decide to stay home to save money in anticipation for medical school. As it is the case at most colleges, most of them never make it and more-or-less stay stuck in some job in their hometown. Take it as you will.
6. Understand that companies and schools have inherent biases favoring local and prestigious applicants. If you're studying in the Mid-West (no diss against the Mid-West) but dream of Los Angeles, understand that you'll have to compete against the Stanford/Berkeley/Harvard BUT ALSO all the Cal State Us and the other UCs. To move away to glamorous locations, you'll need to be above average as an applicant to opportunities far away.
7. Recognize when you're struggling, whether it be from a mental, financial, academic or logistical standpoint. Are you spending 2+ hours commuting? Are you burning out? Are you unhappy missing out on on-campus life? Recognize the difference between the grind and a real problem. To transfer, to invest in a faster commuting system (a car perhaps?), to move out or to take a break (those internships will come in clutch for breaks) shouldn't be taboo. 
8. Network, network, network. Want to move to NYC but you attend Buttf\*ck State? Get on that LinkedIn, find some alumni and get a referral.
9. The more prestigious your hometown school, the easier it'll be to leave to greener pastures. Shoutout to anyone having to attend their hometown school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, y'all got it good.

Lastly, don't push your dreams onto others. We all have different aspirations. Yours might be to move far far away from home. Your friends might resent you, or feel insecure about their wish to stay. Be open and understanding.

I chose my hometown college for financial reasons. I'll be moving away to a big city for an internship soon, but I went through a lot of mental hardships and ultimately I am deeply ashamed of my college choice. I spent too many years in this town and I wish someone had told me those tips earlier.

Don't end up bitter (like me). I can't wait to get to grad school and remove my college from my resume.

What are your thoughts???,"Hear me out here, I’m still in college trying to finish a BS in bio but I’m starting to lose it. I have 5 more classes to finish before I transfer into a 4 year university and finish my degree. I was also planning on minoring in chemistry. I’m at a point in my life where I keep asking myself “if it’s even worth it?” Everyone in my life keeps telling me that what I want is too hard or not for me and That I should just stick to an easy and quick program and just be done with school. Last time I met with an advisor, I went back home crying. She said I should be realistic and go with something that will guarantee me a job. This advisor told me that I’m not gonna make it due to financial limitations and having 2 jobs. My GPA of 3.2 is too low and that’s because I got a C in Ethics ( I was late submitting my final paper which was 50% of the entire grade in the class, but other than that, the class was super easy). What hurts the most is my family’s attitude, my sister tells me that the future I want for myself is not something that I’ll have considering that I’m a refugee from a different country and instead this is something that my children or grandchildren will have. My dad flenches whenever I speak of financial burden and as for my mom… well she never valued education. 
They always say to have a backup plan, mine is of becoming a medical interpreter to help later on with tuition costs when I’m out of financial aid money. 
I want to go to med school. I’m always ridiculed amongst the people I know when I say it. they think I’m too arrogant, not realistic and that I’m a dreamer. 
I’m starting to question myself. It’s not fun. I thought of doing different things and majoring in something “easy” but nothing is satisfying. In fact, the only time I’m happy the most is when I’m doing research for my biology class, when I’m attending a lecture, or when my classmates approach me for questions. I just got a work study as a learning assistant for an honors bio class which is the reason why I’m not dropping out of school this next semester.

cbtv9h,"Dropped out twice, kept hiding it, now I'm on my last rope.","Hello guys,

the first semester I went to university I did pretty well, aced my exams, but for the life of me couldn't manage to write essays. My work ethic is shit and I procrastinated to the point of no return. Didn't habe any friends due to social shame, isolated myself from the world. My parents are the extremely strict academic type-parents so I didn't dare tell them anything about how I was struggling with uni. Meanwhile I had developed severe depression and went undiagnosed for 2-3 semesters, tried to take my life once but through some miracle I survived.

After 4 semesters of hiding, I finally confessed to my parents and they made me feel like I was the dirtiest piece of trash alive. I was extremely scared, ashamed, I just broke down mentally but had no other choice than to switch to anither university. 

Here, I had the same problems, still going with my depression and flunked out in my 2nd semester, because I felt so hollow that I couldn't get to studying and just indulged in video games. I kept this fact hidden and now I'm nearing my 4th semester, when I'm actually unable to keep studying my major. I can't switch it anymore either. I have no one to help me and my parents, who take full financial responsibility over my studies, are probably going to have a heart attack (I'm not joking) and feel like I'm out to make their life miserable, which I definitely am. I'm lost and scared.

Also does your race determine your success ? Or your families economic status?

To be honest, If I could go back, go into a trade, learn something useful, live your life, and move on. I'm in this 'rat race' that's not over and I've been in school for a better part of a decade (off and on).

arfjk6,I hate college & have 100k in debt,"Hi,

I’m a 20 year old Junior at a tech institute studying Management Information Systems. I’m realizing that college is not for me, as I have Borderline Personality Disorder and also a big hatred for my school. My school is responsible for me not receiving a very important internship, and billed me $2700 for trying to move out of campus housing that was growing black mold and has asbestos (no idea what my legal options are there).

I’m currently 100k in debt ( middle class family, bad luck with financial aid), and I want out of my tech school. I’m good at my focus in my major, Database Management Systems, but I don’t know if that’s the path I want to take. I’d be willing to, but I absolutely hate being at my current school and in classroom settings in total. I’ve been able to get 3.0 gpa every semester putting in no effort at all, and I just can’t see myself ever being motivated to keep going to this school and now my grades are beginning to suffer.

I’ve thought about transferring, but my long term girlfriend goes to the same school and we live together, and I’m not really willing to leave her because i’m basically the only person in her life so moving would devestate her. There’s a community college nearby that I haven’t really looked into yet, but I’m not sure what degrees I could get there that could pay off my debt.

I’m basically asking if there’s a way out or if I’m stuck. I’ve never explored options other than university because my parents and teachers pushed me into it and convinced me it was the only way I’d have a happy/successful life (I used to be very trusting/oblivious/naive). I’d be willing to go to a community college, but like I said I don’t know if there’s any jobs that pay high enough to live with my debt. This situation is making my BPD very bad and it’s taking a toll on my mental state. The mental health services at my school are awful (1 appt a month at best) and my insurance puts up a fight for paying for therapists, so it feels like I’m hopeless there as well.

Any input would be appreciated. For reference, most of my debt is from private loans and i’m a first generation student.",college,377,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/arfjk6/i_hate_college_have_100k_in_debt/,False,,176,Oh god... another mental disorder... ,2019-02-17 09:25:38

I suggest play some online multiplayer games, join some sort of club like sports club or gym because those are the places where you will find people with some energy who like making new friends.. 

PS : I have lot of friends rn and had more friends then I ever dreamed off, but the truth is when you get older you filter out useless friends who talk to you when they need you, yes that is the type of people you will find in this modern era. 

So the way I am living my life is Focusing on myself and improving my skills and once I got some bucks people chase me.. I prefer having 1 to 3 good friends because having more then that don't deserve your time..

9xxamb,How do I deal with my envy of the “party life?”,"So I’m a freshman and my year’s going pretty well so far, but I’m kind of wondering if I’m following the right path.

I look around at the fraternities and sororities and I see others partying every weekend. There’s also the big football game day where everyone is a fan. I’m torn: on one hand, I know that I dislike just about everything about these things. On the other hand, it seems like everyone else is having more fun than me.

As a bit of background, I’m a kind of introverted person, and have usually made only a few close friends. In high school and now, I hold myself to a pretty strict focus on schoolwork and prefer organized activities to just like “hanging out.” I have never drank or done drugs, and have no desire to do so. I’m not really a spectator sports fan and I also (maybe critically) don’t use Snapchat. Like messaging is fine, but I think snap streaks are stupid, although everyone else seems to network with it.

So basically, I have good reasons to not get involved with partying or anything like that, but I can’t help but feel a little jealous of everyone else who seems to be having more fun. I talk to other kids who seem pretty chill, and hearing them talk about partying and drinking is intriguing to me because it’s such a foreign concept that I’ve never even considered. I still have no desire to drink, Snapchat, “get wasted,” or whatever, but most of the kids my age seem to connect with each other at parties and stuff where that happens.

Bluntly, I’m interested in social action besides the nerds: I’m throughly a nerd and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I’d like to connect with other people too and try different things without getting involved with stupid or illegal activities. I know FOMO but like I do feel like that sometimes. Can anyone else give me any advice? Suggestions? Relatable issue?

My Aunt also kept trying to play it off to her kids that I was rich because I am in school when the reality is I am paying for it all of my own. My cousin and her boyfriend (who didn't finish high school) told me that I am wasting my life with school and that a ""real man"" gets his hands dirty at work. My uncle chimed in to tell me that university is for brainwashing people into liberals who hate guns. Other than that my dad and grandmother were petty happy about school. So does anyone else have any crazy family stories about school? If not maybe this one will at least make you laugh a little!",college,363,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8wul3d/has_anyones_family_tried_to_make_them_feel_bad/,False,,111,[deleted] ,2018-07-08 01:00:09
ev6t97,[Italy] Am I too stupid for University?,"You must get this a lot, but I'm afraid I might be wasting my parents' money for no good reason... I'll give you as much info as possible because I really do think that I might be walking the wrong path. 

My timeline: I started off as a curious toddler who liked science, read a lot and enjoyed life. 
In middle school, I got into a ""love story"" that distracted me from my studies and I found myself less and less interested in studying; when my parents found out and we were torn apart, I skipped another year of studying because of the Lovesick Spoiled Kid's Depression™. 
In high school, I was diligent throughout the first three years and then got depressed (always tired, couldn't get out of bed, couldn't think clearly, very forgetful and suicidal). I barely got out of there but I wasn't in a great mental state; actually I kept getting worse. 
I dragged myself to University, passed the (VERY easy) test for Anthropology and here I am.

But I can't focus on studying and when I can, I don't understand a thing and forget the sentences I read in no time. I find myself going through a couple of pages for hours and I KNOW it's just not how it's supposed to go for someone who has the capacity of getting a degree. 
I can't afford going to a therapist so I'm not going to get any better and I feel like I get worse every day. 

On the other hand, I don't want to go back home because I can't stand my family and it makes my life worse to have them around (they insult me often and, even though they're right, this just makes me want to kill myself more which is inconvenient because I don't have the courage to do it) and going to University was my excuse to get away from here. What can I do? I might be able to get a job here but I'm not sure... Should I try saving some money and then decide whether to drop out or not? I don't know what to do, even now that I wrote this I feel myself drifting off to sleep... I got 10 hours of sleep last night. Maybe if I did some low effort job like a cashier it would be easier to deal with the sleepiness/concentration problems?




EDIT: thank you everyone for your suggestions, I think I'll go get tested for ADHD as soon as I can... I will see what to do from then. (Probably see if the meds work and eventually go to therapy when I can afford it, or try my luck with a public therapist)

I honestly think I'm interested in Anthropology. So much in me has changed ever since I started this uni, even though I'm struggling so much... My other interest was med school but I think Anthropology appeases my thirst for knowledge of other perspectives and overall it seems like it could be more rewarding in the long run. It's also coherent with my interest in my regional folklore and I know that if I succeed in understanding the methods that are proposed in this course then I'll be prepared to understand our folklore better and, hopefully, contribute to its preservation. My only worries were with truly being too stupid for it...

I'll try to be honest with myself, give up my studies (maybe even temporarily, if I see that I just need to get better to try again) and find a job if I'm truly too stupid to stay here, I guess.",college,362,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ev6t97/italy_am_i_too_stupid_for_university/,False,Europe,63,"Yes, if you can’t complete your classes properly, and your parents aren’t worth more than a million dollars, I’d think about alternatives.

6xhwtg,PSA: The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opens October 1! Post all FAFSA questions here!,"The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opened on October 1, 2017. If you plan to attend college during the 2018-2019 school year, you should submit a FAFSA if you are [eligible](https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc03a.htm) to do so.

First time? Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. This is your legal, electronic signature. You cannot submit the FAFSA without one. If mom/dad has already created an FSA ID (for older siblings), they must use that one.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, 2016 tax information, any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the [FAFSA](https://fafsa.gov/)!
If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Post your questions about the FAFSA only on this thread, so as to avoid clogging the sub with posts. I work in financial aid and I will be happy to help.

**Please reference [last year's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/54mjwp/psa_the_fafsa_for_the_20172018_school_year_opens/) before posting-- your question may have been addressed there.**",college,368,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6xhwtg/psa_the_fafsa_for_the_20182019_school_year_opens/,False,,631,"Hey, I'm applying to colleges in the US for the fall of 2018.

a6p837,The Issue with Extra Curricular Leadership Positions,"I go to a very competitive school and one major concern on everyone’s mind is the need to get an extracurricular leadership position. Observing my peers, I noticed something that resulted from this environment: leadership cannibalization.

What exactly is this? Assume you’re a club leader interviewing people for a position. You receive a bunch of resumes and notice a candidate who is already involved in multiple clubs with leadership experience. You’re impressed and are highly considering offering the position to this student.

You go on and conduct interviews. With no surprise, this candidate of interest performs exceptionally well. It’s a tough call between her and a few other students, so you pick her based on how impressive her resume is. Given her involvement, she surely will be successful taking on the position, right? Wrong!

You offer the candidate the role and she accepts. As time goes on, you notice her performance is lacking. This student is always busy; sometimes she can’t always attend meetings due to other events or whatever the case may be. Although this student is bright, she can’t fully dive into the position and contribute as much as anticipated due to her other extracurriculars digging into her schedule. This is leadership cannibalization.

The issue at hand is that (at least at my school) there is a huge gap between students who are highly and little involved with leadership opportunities. The ones who are highly involved take control of many available opportunities which results in the gap and degraded performance. Students aren’t concerned with what they can achieve with one position but how many positions they can put on a piece of paper. This mentality is wrong!

In the end, I wanted to share this idea and see if anyone here agrees. I think people involved on campus should be highly conscious of this and focus more on developing meaningful experiences rather than racking up positions like its a trophy collection. There is only so much you can do with only 24 hours a day.

tldr: There is a gap between students highly and little involved with campus leadership opportunities. Students with leadership roles are far more likely to acquire more. This drives the gap and also results in poor performance since such students have to handle very demanding schedules.",college,356,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a6p837/the_issue_with_extra_curricular_leadership/,False,USA,31,"The only things I'm involved in at the moment are band and philosophy club. I don't have any other interest at the moment and would rather not overwhelm myself. I'm also going to have to get a job next year to start paying for myself, so I doubt I can squeeze in anything else.

I don't really care much for people who cannot keep a little time open for outside social time. They clearly have a lack of outside perspective as they're only goal is to better themselves.

Note: It's good to keep yourself busy and successful but people who can't leave room for their own friends and family cannot possibly be happy and personally successful. ",2018-12-16 22:04:55
9wpvjm,Dealing with arrogant people in a class,"Day 1 of Calculus 1 class. A few of us students are gathered around, talking about their previous experience in calculus. This kid walks into the room, and announces ""I got a 5 on the AP calculus BC exam. *I'm* only here for an easy A"". then proceeds to brag about how he got an A in honors physics in high school. 

Oh boy.

I sit next to this kid, because we both sit in the front row. He is *so* annoying. Every class, he's either:

\-  bragging about how easy he finds calculus (Prof: ""Ok this can be a tricky concept....."" Kid: ""I get it!! I think it's easy!!"")

\-making comments about how much he knows, etc. ("" I did something like this in honors physics!!"")

\- asking tangentially related questions to the syllabus

\- sucking up to the professor. Like, he told the professor, ""I'm going to change my major and become a math professor because you've inspired me so much"" then asked if he could help the professor grade papers.

\- brags about how little sleep he gets and how hard his workload is. He says he's taking 7 classes this semester, which I *know* is complete bullshit because the engineering department wouldn't let you take 7 classes.

If you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.gov) if you are [eligible to do so](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/eligibility).

2019-2020 school year: Use the 2019-2020 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2018. This one requires 2017 tax information.

2020-2021 school year: Use the 2020-2021 FAFSA, which opens October 1, 2019. This one requires 2018 tax information.

**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide to the financial aid process.**

1. Create an [FSA ID](http://www.fsaid.ed.gov). This is your legal electronic signature to sign your FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. If your parent already has an FSA ID (for themselves or for other children), they must use their existing FSA ID.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the [IRS Data Retrieval Tool](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/resources/irs-drt-text), use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

I'm an international student and at our university all international students are required to take the  native language ""version"" of their ""College Writing 101"" type of course.

&#x200B;

The version of the course for native speakers is like it is for most students who can write a basic essay, hold their own in a simple debate, and read semi-challenging text anywhere else - piece of cake, waste of time, do the work and show up to class you get a good grade.   


For the foreigners, ours is more of a ""how well do you know our language"" course. And For learners of a foreign language, everyone comes from different backgrounds. Some of the kids in my class were fresh out of high school here, so they were actually already fluent. Some were just newly graduated out of a language academy. Where I was mostly self-taught and hadn't take formal classes for over 2 years.   


The course was relative graded. I studied my butt off for this course, i would put in hours and hours of work to perfect essays and try to catch up on all the vocabulary and grammar I was lacking. My group mates pretty much did none of the work in our debate, came completely unprepared and were really immature and disrespectful to me even though I'm an upperclassmen, and because of them our debate was a complete disaster, and even though my speaking ability wasn't as sharp or well-expressed I was at least prepared to the best of my ability.   


This course drove me nuts and I would cry myself to sleep often because of it, because of how hopeless and stupid it made me feel, and how i felt like everyone else in the class was just messing around and didn't take it seriously, getting easy A's cause their language ability was just better than mine - something that I can't improve with just memorization or hours of studying but time and lots of practice and experience.   


I tried to talk about it with the professor and she just gave me this ""aw poor you this class must be hard for you"" lecture and I'm like uh, YEAH. ""I took the test and was placed in the advanced level and i'm clearly not advanced, drop me down."" and she refused.   


I barely got a C in that class. Pissed me off and I wrote one hell of a nasty email to her about how the system is corrupt and that for a course taught in everyones 2nd or 3rd language having a relative grading system is completely stupid.   


My opinion on relative grading is the same for courses that even though I tried super hard to understand I still struggled like a paraplegic trying to walk - impossible - and turned in completely blank exams, gave up on the homework because i couldn't even come close to udnerstanding it and we don't have a tutor system and the professor's office hours collided with my part-time job, so i was completely helpless. and yet I still passed with a C+...I don't feel relieved or happy about passing because i know that I didn't earn it and had nothing to show for it.   


I think that hard work, effort, and results that obviously are produced from that hard work should be part how students are graded individually. Not comparing them to each other and then making cut offs. (If more than 10% of a 100 student class qualifies for As don't just give ten students As and then just dismiss the next 15 as Bs, consider the fact that either you're a good professor or your course/grading criteria is too easy.)

a4y4gg,Does anyone else have to deal with this?,"My roommate literally sleeps in until about 2 pm everyday. All my classes start and end literally before she even opens her eyes. Does anyone else have to deal with tip-toeing around? It’s annoying. 


Edit: Ok let me add some stuff since you all think she is depressed. She isn't. We're pretty good friends, we get along really well and we talk about pretty much everything. This is literally the only problem I have with her. She just likes to go out Wednesday-Sunday and stay out until 3 or 4 am. She usually doesn't go to sleep until 3-5am on even other days. I think it's just a habit, not a disorder and not depression. 


Edit 2: Let me clarify MORE things since this is getting more traffic than I thought it would... We both have separate rooms, we share a suite (living room, kitchenette, bathroom).

d0g8bp,How can I socialize without drinking?,"I've been in college for a year now, and somehow, every social activity seems to involve drinking. Even during chill hangout sessions with my friends, watching some dumb movie, someone ends up pulling out the liquor. It's not that I judge people who drink (lord knows I used to have my fun), but early freshman year I started medication that makes it so I can't have alcohol. I don't smoke, either.

I get that for a lot of people college is the first time they get to let loose, and I don't want to prevent my friends from being able to do that. It's just that I'm getting tired of being the only sober one in the room. The more I'm around alcohol, the more I think I should just have one drink, to be a part of it all, but I know that's the wrong choice. I thought we were having plenty of fun when our hangouts didn't involve drinking, but now I'm worried that if I ask for us to have a few more sober occasions, I'll be a total buzzkill. 

I worry it's ruining my chances with new friends, too. I've just joined a program at school, and I really want to get to know everyone, but all of the group hangout sessions have been about partying and going to local bars. I couldn't even go if I wanted to, since I don't have a fake.

ci65dx,Im not sure if I’m getting cold feet or if I actually don’t want to go to college,"My whole life I’ve been looking forward to college. As a little kid, I would dream about it and look forward to it. This entire year I have been looking forward to it and planning. I was so happy when I was accepted into my university. Going to college was never pushed by my parents, I’ll be the first of my siblings to graduate, let alone go to college. That being said, this was always my choice. 

But now, I’m not sure if I want to go. I’m stressed about the money, so I’m not sure if that’s causing it. I’ve always wanted to travel the world and want to teach English abroad, so I don’t know if that interest is making me question my choices. Or maybe I’m just getting cold feet and this will pass. I’m supposed to move in next month and I’ve already invested a lot of money into this. I’m just worried that I’ll invest more and end up not wanting it. 

Worst comes to worst, it’s only 4 years and a bachelors degree always opens doors. I’m really just not sure what to do. Will this feeling pass? Will I be miserable? If I am, is it best to just deal with it? Has this happened to anyone else?

c9lyml,The school I was set to transfer to this fall canceled my offer of admission,"As mentioned in the title, I was finally going to transfer to a four year this fall after spending 3 years at a CC in California. If you guys aren't familiar with how CC to four year transfer works, you need to have completed a minimum of 60 IGETC units to be able to transfer.

Spring 2019 was supposed to be my last semester, however something really bad happened to me during the last two weeks of classes. I was sent to the ER with really bad pains in my feet and hands, turns out I was diagnosed with a highly contagious disease and prevented me from going anywhere. Because of this I reached out to all my professors right away to make arrangements on what I could do in regards to me being unable to set foot on campus to take my finals. Luckily I was was able to work something out with 2 out of 3 of my professors and passed both of those. However, my bio professor never got back to me, even after countless emails and phone calls to his office. Long story short: he gave me an F and I was scared shitless so I reached out to my new college ASAP.

&#x200B;

I informed them about the whole situation and asked what I needed to do so that my admission offer would stay in tact. The told me to contact them right away with unofficial transcripts and a letter of explanation. I explained the whole situation with the medical problem and unresponsive professor. Even after all that they said because of the missing credits from the bio class, they have to cancel my offer of admission. Ever since then I've honestly been really down and can feel my depression coming back despite my efforts of staying positive.

&#x200B;

So I reached out to the dean of natural sciences at my CC and basically snitched on my professor for not responding to students and for giving me an inaccurate grade because of my medical situation. An administrative assistant got back to me and informed me that because of the 4th of July they won't get back to me until Monday but she told me that she informed the dean right away to get a hold of this professor to see if they could change the status of the class to incomplete or get a grade change for me.

&#x200B;

Now my question is, has this happened to anyone before? If so what happened in your situation? If I got a grade change and contacted the university, could they reinstate my offer of admission? Because I honestly don't want to wait another year and reapply to universities all over again. As a first-gen, my family is all really psyched for me to be finally going to a university and so am I. But if I don't end up going to university this fall, I'll have to wait a whole year and I really don't want to waste anymore time. Please offer my any advice, because I'm deadass terrified.

&#x200B;

Edit: Professor never responded, dean & department sided with him. I am now waiting a whole year to be able to transfer, thanks to this stupid professor. I am also forced to retake Bio in the fall because no grade change.

bgv0o2,Were my questions really that stupid?,"Edit 1: I want to thank everyone for their input on both sides of this issue. I agree that some of the fault is mine. I do not know if English is not the professors original language. Also this is an online class and I live somewhere else so office hours are a no go. I did not realize perplexed can be negative so I also learned something. I honestly used perplexed a lot and have never been told that.

Edit 2: I feel as i have gotten enough advice so I will stop responding to individual comments. I agree my emails could have been interpreted as rude so I sent an apology to the professor that if my words sounded rude or inflexible that was not my intention. She seemed to respond positively to this. I will be making a YouTube video over my project. I am not going to try to get more information on the wiki as I feel that my first approach failed. I will not be looking at further comments but thank you everyone the insight to my own faults was extremely useful.

Final Edit: I am deleting the specifics of the thread as they can be easily tied back to IRL me. 

TLDR; My professor replied in a way to my questions that I perceived as rude. Based on replies below, both me and my professor may have been misinterpreting each others emails which led to a large miscommunication. I feel like others can learn from the comments that written emails can be read a lot of different ways and the importance of being clear and concise in the first email.",college,336,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bgv0o2/were_my_questions_really_that_stupid/,False,,58,"Hi I'm ""professor aged"" (older by a generation, or a gen and a half, than most college students), so here's my take. I think the word perplexed started off the miscommunication. It can be read as rather snarky or challenging (mom to teen ""I'm perplexed why you would walk to school in the rain without an umbrella"" or ""I'm perplexed why you said your homework was done, but then I see a blank page on your desk"").

Also I think the usage of perplexed typically places the confusion it implies with the situation itself, not the person trying to interpret it (the mom isn't really confused about the umbrella/rain, she is questioning the judgement of her son who would go out in the rain like that; the article the student read was *perplexing* not because she didn't understand it, but because the article *itself* was written poorly and was confusing). So, your stating that you were perplexed by the assignment implied that this is happening because it is a bad assignment, and that you are questioning why the professor would give students such (poor, inferior, etc.) work to do. Therefore, it was seen as disrespectful that you a student questioned or demanded justification regarding a professor's assignment.

Try saying sometime ""I find that perplexing"" to someone you care about regarding something they have done, and see if it does not come off as offensive. See?

I know everyone always tells college students to reach out to your professors, that it will work in your favor, but this shows that is not always the case.

Next time, it would be better, if you email a professor, to berate yourself at the beginning of your request for help, to be sure you sound humble and do not sound like you are challenging the professor's authority (I would not give that advice to everyone, but I think in your case, you need it, as maybe communication is not a strong suite of yours). Apologize at least once, and say thank you many times in your email. Also, very clearly state from the get go that it is *you* who does not understand, and perhaps give a reason why you are lacking (as opposed to blaming Prof for a bad assignment).

If you are a freshman or sophomore or new transfer (or part of a special bridge program for veterans or URM or 1st Gen student), identify yourself as such, to make clear to the professor that you are new to college (or this college) and they should not assume you to know everything. Further benefit, this gains their sympathy (,you need to play the game).  

Last, of course, try to use the internet and YouTube tutorials FiRST to figure stuff out on your own! Don't ask dumb questions.  Don't ask for help when it is obvious you could solve it yourself. And yes, there are dumb questions, despite what nice people always say. So maybe just figure it out and don't ask the professor at all

Here's a sample email (version 1, where you plan to go to office hours):

""Dear Prof. ___,

I'm am Joe Shmoe, a freshman student in your ___ class. I'm having a bit of a hard time with the wiki page assignment. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I've never had to make a wiki page before. We didn't do anything like that at my old (high) school (community college)  . 

I've already watched two ""How to Make a Wiki page"" tutorials, but I'm worried I still don't quiet get it. I'm planning on coming to your next office hours on Wednesday at 3pm for more help with my Wiki page. I just wanted to give you some notice, so you would know what I am hoping to get help with. Thank you so much.

Again, I'm so sorry I am not already familiar with creating wiki pages. Thanks in advance for being able to help me.  I really enjoy your class, and have learned so much already!

Kindly,
Joe Shmoe""


Here another example (not going to office hours):

Dear Prof. ___,

I'm am Joe Shmoe, a freshman student in your ___ class. I'm having a bit of a hard time with the wiki page assignment. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I've never had to make a wiki page before. We didn't do anything like that at my old (high) (community college) school. 

I've already watched two ""How to Make a Wiki page"" tutorials, but I'm worried I still don't quiet get it. I'm so sorry this is not coming easily to me.

Is it possible you could email me some pointers or resources for making wiki pages? Or, if you know of an on campus resource for help with things like this, I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in that direction. I could also come by your office of that works better.

I'm so sorry to bother you with this. I was hoping to figure the wiki page thing out on my own, but I'm struggling. Thank you again so much for any help you can provide. I really appreciate it 

I really enjoy your class, and have learned so much already.

Sincerely,
Joe Shmoe""


LASTLY: I think you are probably WAY better at face to face communication than over email. Maybe avoid emailing professor's and instead just show up at office hours. 

Remember, he or she is a professor of _____, not wiki. He/She would love to have students email questions about economic theories (econ prof), math proofs (math prof), inequities in education (teaching college prof), Renaissance poetry (English Lit Prof)...but wiki pages....? These people dedicate their lives to a very niche area of knowledge, and they are passionate about their subject matter. Your professor was perhaps really excited to see an email from from a student (as opposed to all the bureaucratic emails that get in the workplace)...and then to see your question had nothing to do with the content of the class, but just how to make a wiki page? Might have been a let down.

I wish you luck with the rest of your studies.  I hope some of my advice might help you to make improved connections with your professors in the future. ",2019-04-24 22:05:20
arlpmj,People with social anxiety: how do you deal with presentations?,"So far ive done a few presentations in my college life.


 1. was for my Spanish class. For both Spanish 1 and 2. The teacher allowed us to Literally just read from the slides since she knew that most people weren't good at talking Spanish. So thats how I managed to do it even though I'm fluent in Spanish.

2. For a computee science class. Long story short, it was a train wreak. i stuttered and it was awful and cringy. I blame myself for not being prepared. 

3. Supposubly it was for a physics class but I chose not to do it and got a 0. Although i still passed with a low 70 though since it was like 20% so its all good.

4. Speech class. I enrolled I this class twice and twice I dropped it because I just can't deal with the pressure of speaking in class. I managed to 'survive' the first couple of weeks in this class but stopped attending since just sitting in the lecture room, id start to feel incredibly nervous, shaky and uneasy.

5. I'm currently  taking a class that requires me to do a presentation at the end of the semester. Obviously I'm not sure if ill be able to pass this one since its worth 30% of my overall grade. 

Overrall, ive always been quiet and shy. I dont have friends at college. At first I hated that but I learned to be ok with it and it doesn't bother me no more. The only friends I have are my old high school friends but I rarely see them since they don't go to college.I tried following the classic 'join a club' advice and I did do it. It always emds up the same. Everyone is has their groups of friends. Even if I do try to interact with them, they usually briefly reply but them focus on what their group is doing. I did briefly volunteer but the same thing would happen.

My grades are bad because I would rather just use Google to get answers to questions rather than go to office hours. I have no internships but tried to go to career fairs. Most of the time it ends up the same. I come of as awkward and weird. 

Part of me feels like ill never get my degree because I just can't deal with speaking in class or people in general and I've considered dropping completely. I realize that as I advance further in my degree (Computer science), I'm required to do more presentations. 

So I'm curious how y'all introverts/socially anxious/awkward people managed to survive this?

ab7a32,I can’t tell if I chose the wrong school,I just finished my first freshman semester at college . I chose a school very close to home but I’m living in the dorm. I’m a music performance major. All through the college process I KNEW I wasn’t going to attend this university but 2 weeks before decision day they offered me a spot in a prestigious music program at their school along with a decent scholarship so I eventually caved and went to this school. I guess the people in the music school are OK (I’m not SUPER SUPER close with anyone but I have a couple of decent friends) but I feel like I don’t fit in with the university as a whole. I’m the quiet nerdy type and the majority of this school just wants to hookup and party All the time. I don’t fit in at all. Most people I know are saying things like “wow I CANT WAIT to get back to school and see all my friends” and “I love break but am SO EXCITED to go back go university”..and I’m over here just dreading going back. I had issues with depression and anxiety (and BAD procrastination) last semester so I can’t tell if I’m unhappy about going back do to my own issues or if I truly truly don’t belong at this school. I feel trapped and lost right now .. I’m telling myself that if I’m still unhappy these first few weeks I’m going to start applications in February to transfer for sophomore year.

It felt like everyone around me was constantly partying, but that wasn't me. Like others have said, become involved in something before you make your final decision. It may be that the school isn't for you, but it may also be that you haven't branched out enough. As an introvert, I get that!

g4zy7d,"How did you get your parents to understand that online school is more work, not a free vacation?","I'm a sophomore in college who, like so many of us, was kicked off my campus due to the pandemic and now all my classes are online. I'm a biology major taking 18 credits, as well as having my 2 on-campus jobs that can be done remotely, and participation in clubs and councils that is also remote now, so I find myself busier and more stressed than I was on campus. The issue is that my parents seem to think that me being home for the rest of the semester is a free vacation? They ask me to do chores every day (clean, walk dogs, make dinner, etc.) that I quite frankly don't have the time for and when I try to explain how busy I am, I get mocked. I'm not sure how to explain to them that my school schedule was built without having to do all of the extra time-consuming chores I do at home, so I won't be able to do everything that I can normally do until the semester is over. They're both essential employees and not home during the day, so I think they think I sit around all day doing nothing.

If anyone had similar troubles, how did you get your parents to realize that you're actually busy and not just exaggerating or pretending??

ekxla9,"Received a grade of D which I felt did not match up with how I did in the class. Emailed my professor and the head of the chair, and have not any response from them, not sure what to do.","When I saw I had a final grade of D in one of my classes I was shocked. I did well and passed the two tests which counted for 50% of my grade, and I did decent on the final paper (80%) as well which counted for another 20 percent of the class. so I was confused as to how I ended up with a D. Then I realize my other assignment that I emailed to her wasn't graded which counted as 15 percent. I spoke with her before finals about emailing her my assignment project and she told me that I could email my assignment to her on the last day of class. I checked my email triple times after I sent it to her to make sure it was sent. I even sent her a follow up to make sure she got my assignment and still had no response from her. I assumed she may have checked it, since sometimes in class when I asked her if she received my email she told me yes, so I thought she looks at emails but just doesn't respond. on my rate professor, students also complained that she never responds to emails and to not bother contacting her that way.


I talked with my advisor and she told me to email my professor about it and discuss why I got that grade, the problem is she never responds to email which I found very frustrating and basically why i nearly failed this course. I tried anyway and sent her an email about this and not to my surprise, no response. My advisor then told me if she doesn't respond, to email the chairman of the department of my major about this issue. I went and emailed the department chair a week ago, and i have not gotten a response from them either. Im at a loss and not sure what to do from this point. I sent her a follow up email today but i doubt I will hear any response. Can I call them and talk to them on the phone about it?


. Im pretty bummed out about this. If I were to transfer to another school from community college, would this mean only 59 credits would transfer, since a D doesn't count as a credit. I also think it may be too late for professor to change the grade at this point, the semester ended on December 19th, and its January now and the new semester already started .

i’m [22F] the second one. i used to love that about myself because i could try so many things but now its kind of fucking me over. 

my parents were always very strict and on top of me about my grades. they paid for me to go to college a couple years, and i didn’t do so well. 

i was academically dismissed and basically wasted 2 years of college. my parents are still so disappointed in me. 

a big reason i failed was because i kept changing majors and didn’t know what the hell i wanted to do. i still don’t know what i want to do.

i have spent all the time since then taking courses at a community college and bartending. 

i know the importance of getting a degree but i just feel like i’m not getting the hang of college and i never will. but i don’t want to disappoint my parents or myself. 

also, if i get back into the university i would have to pay loans and i don’t know if its even worth it anymore. 

here are the 4 career paths that i would be okay with. 

1. interior designer: i absolutely love and enjoy interior design, but its a very risky path to take. 
2. stand up comedian: my dream job since day 1, but not very realistic.
3. social psychologist: i am super interested in how/why people interact with each other. but i feel like i would never get a job.

b42tjt,How to Confront A Bad Roommate,"I really need some help. I have an awful roommate and I’m in tears writing this. I am very socially anxious and my roommate (shared bedroom) needs to have a lot more respect for me. I have no idea how to talk to her and I can’t go to an RA because I feel like she is gonna tell me to talk to her before I even mention anything to the RA. She never goes to class and doesn’t have a car or job so she is in the room 24/7 almost. She is not paying the school any money because FAFSA denied her since she failed last semester and is failing this one. It makes me so upset she is here. I am a nursing student and I work up to 35 hours a week as a nurse’s assistant. I have lots of late nights and early mornings and sometimes I do not sleep for over 24 hours because I work two part time jobs. My sleep is so important to me. She is constantly going in and out of the room from 10pm - 4 am. She has had multiple boys over in the room without warning me and I feel very uncomfortable because they come in at 2 am when I’m asleep and I get woken up by them. I often sleep in a nightshirt and I can’t even get up to go to the bathroom because I don’t want the guy to see my in my nightshirt, maybe I am just bashful I don’t know. She sleeps with the TV very loud on after I asked her to turn it down and I physically went over and turned it down because she’s not even watching it I thought she was asleep. She often leaves the door unlocked and does not take her keys and asks me to leave it unlocked. A few nights ago, in the middle of the night, a girl came into the room without knocking because my roommate had asked me to leave it unlocked and she was gone for over two hours. Her friend rummaged around looking for food. I cannot sleep here. I’m sorry if this post is a mess but I don’t know what to do.

c99ogt,my parents don’t support my major,"it’s not official yet but i want to change my major to psychology. as of right now i’m a biology major and i hate it- it’s nothing but science courses and biological electives. it’s also more geared for pre-med students, which isn’t me. 

i’m passionate about psychology, i’m better at it, i enjoy the writing as i read a lot and pride myself in having good writing skills. im pre-physicians assistant regardless of what my major is, so isn’t that all the more reason to major in something i actually enjoy? also, if for some reason i change my mind about the PA track (which i’m considering), i would be interested in getting my masters in something psych related. my parents hate this idea because it means more schooling and more money to spend but i’m going to be stuck with student loan debt regardless, so why not go ahead and get my masters? 

also, my parents don’t understand no matter how many times i tell them that i can major in anything i want and still be pre-PA. i’ve had to explain this so many times to them and it’s like they get amnesia or something, and i have to tell them again. a few months ago when i decided i wanted to change my major and explained to them that i would still aim for PA school, they were supportive. 

and finally, i think my parents want me to major in something like biology because they care about how i look to other people. this is actually the reason i’m writing this post- we were talking to a neighbor and i told them my situation, and once i went back inside my mom blew up in my face telling me i’m wasting my time majoring in psych and that i’ll be working a dead-end job i don’t like. i had to explain to her that i’m still PA and like i said before, she doesn’t understand what the fuck i mean when i tell her i can major in just about anything and still go to PA school. also my neighbor was asking me questions about school and my dad started answering questions for me. it makes me so mad because i can tell they have some plan for me that they don’t want. i’ve ranted to my advisor about this more than once and she tells me every time to do what i want. what do i do in this situation? also how do i deal with my parents?

edit: 1) i am aware that what i said about debt is stupid and that i do not want more debt than less debt. 2) i am aware that a psychology BA is one of the most useless degrees i can get, which is why if i go through with psych i would go to grad school.",college,327,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/c99ogt/my_parents_dont_support_my_major/,False,,118,"Disclaimer.

4xetni,What to bring with you to your dorm,"There was a request in the megathread to make a new megathread dedicated to stuff to bring with you to college in hopes to cut down on the amount of people asking this question. We hope this will helpful for incoming freshman. If I miss anything on the list please comment down below so I can edit it in. If its received well I'll also consider putting it in the sidebar as a resource for future freshman that come to the subreddit in upcoming years. 




Remember that your dorm room will probably be smaller than your room at home. Don't bring too much stuff- especially too many clothes. 





**Essential Items To Bring**


* Personal Items- Student ID, Government Issued ID, some spending money or a debit/credit card, anything else you might need in order to secure employment on/off campus. 


* Bed Sheets

* Pillows + Pillow Cases


* Comforter + Blankets


* Laundry Basket


* Laundry Items (Detergent, Fabric Softener, Tide Pods, Whatever you use at home)


* Clothes Hangers

* Deodorant/antiperspirant  


* Any Medication you take at home


* Cold Medicine + Cough Drops. Sickness spreads fast in dorms. 



* Tissues 

* Napkins


* Umbrella + Clothing appropriate for rain/light snow


* Shower caddy


* Flip flops for the shower


* Shampoo/Conditioner/Body Wash/Anything else you use in the shower


* At least 2 towels 


* Toothbrush + Toothpaste. I've actually seen people forget this. 


* Anything else you usually use in the bathroom at home- floss, facial moisturizer, cotton swabs, hair dryer, etc 


* Shaving products


* Enough clothes. Don't bring your whole wardrobe but also don't bring so little that you have to do laundry every few days. I pack about 15 shirts, a couple pairs of pants, 15ish pairs of underwear and socks, and a few sweaters. 


* Formal Clothing. If you have a full suit consider bringing it. I bring a few dress shirts for interviews. You want to make sure you bring something other than just tshirts and jeans in case something comes up where you need to dress more formally. 


* A general first aid kit. At least have a few bandaids and antibiotic cream in case of minor injury


* Trash Bags. Trash bins are usually provided and you don't have to bring your own. 

* Water Bottle 


* Cleaning supplies to keep your room somewhat clean 



* Plastic forks/spoons/knives as well as bowls, plates, and cups. 


* Batteries if you use anything that requires batteries. 


* Extension cord. 

* Food. Stuff like Ramen you can keep in your room for a while without it going bad 


* Storage Bins or Boxes

**School Supplies** 



* Pens and Pencils + Eraser. 


* Pencil Sharpener if bringing non-mechanical pencils 


* Notebooks/Binders/Paper 



* Folders



* Backpack 


* Laptop or some form of computer. 


* Graphing Calculator 


* Stuff for taking Notes. Highlighters/Index Cards/Post-it Notes. Only bring if you think you'll use it. 



**Non-Essential Items that are useful or may come in handy**



* A fan 


* Headphones to block out noise


* Stamps/Envelopes in case you have to mail something


* A microwave and fridge (Check regulations for your school)


* TV/Monitor + Possible Gaming Consoles 


* Coffee Maker


* Electric Kettle

* Posters/Wall Decorations 


* Rug

* A toolkit 


* Flashlight 


* Iron 


* Kitchen products like pots/pans if you think you might cook once in a while instead of eat in the dining halls. 


* A shoe rack 


* A safe/footlocker if you wish to lock up valuables. 


* Door Decorations- some people really like the mini-whiteboard 


* Lint Brush 


* Condoms. RA's usually hand out free ones but I prefer bringing my own. 



* Tape



* Scissors 


* Paper Clips/Stapler 


* Lamps


* Bike/Skateboard. Be sure to bring a bike lock if you bring your bike. 


* Melatonin 

* Mattress Pad


* A picture frame with something to remind you of home


**What Not to Bring With You**



* Printer. Printers are available in the library and some universities, like mine, give a certain amount of free prints. I never use them up in a semester. Also people will hate you if you have a wifi printer. 



* Winter Clothing. Bring a hoodie or light jacket with you on move in day- but don't bring the heavy winter gear right away. Pick it up over thanksgiving break or visit home and bring it back with you. Only exception being if you're an international student or out of state student and won't be returning home until winter break. 



* Textbooks. If you are bringing textbooks with you on move-in day then you are making a classic freshman mistake. Textbooks are never required on the first day of class. Attend class first to see if its really going to be needed. And never buy full price. Free pdfs of textbooks are out there on the internet. If you're looking for a legal alternative- renting from sites like amazon is almost always way cheaper than buying a brand new textbook. 



* A chair. Unless you're 100% sure housing doesn't provide any- your chair will probably be sitting under your bed for the entire semester. 


* Stuff your roommate will be bringing. Reach out to your roommate and coordinate who brings what. You don't want to waste space by having two people bring the same item that you guys can just share. 

* Stuff your college provides. Some colleges provide, for instance, fridges and microwaves to their students living in dorms. If this is the case- don't bring your own. Check to see what is already provided to you. 

* Your highschool relationship. Especially if its gonna be long distance once you move into college. Consider if its really worth it. It usually doesn't work out and those long skype calls can prevent you from meeting other people in the beginning weeks of dorm life. Trust me- my relationship from highschool ended rather quickly once college started. 


* Banned Items. Check with housing to see what's allowed and what's not. I love the smell of candles but unfortunately they're just not allowed in my dorm or many dorms across the country. You don't want to bring something that could get you in trouble. 








Leave any suggestions and feedback down below. If you have any questions pertaining items not on the list feel free to ask below and someone will get back to you.

b34scv,Statement from the University of Pennsylvania on the college admissions scandal.,"&#x200B;

[Statement from Penn regarding admissions scandal](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/a-statement-from-the-university-of-pennsylvania-regarding-the-college-admissions-bribery-scandal?fbclid=IwAR1cDwrdFb6skRsdduzhqT81Kz4uyPpcop8bxUqIYA5hf-4RqN_HB6AEDT8)

////Edit: Here’s the actual text////

When we learned that at least 50 people participated in a massive college admissions scam, deploying fraudulent means to get their children into our nation’s elite universities, **we were appalled, disgusted, and outraged that not a single one of them was using these deviant tactics to get into the University of Pennsylvania.**

It is just despicable that these privileged, wealthy families, who already enjoy every advantage, would be so deceitful and unethical in their efforts to secure a coveted spot at Yale, Stanford, or Georgetown, but not at Penn, which — friendly reminder! — is an Ivy League school. It’s extremely exclusive. Very difficult to get into. Definitely harder than Georgetown and sometimes harder than Stanford; it sort of depends on the year.

What’s especially appalling to us, as one of the finest academic institutions in the world, is how many of these students did not even care about their education. We’re looking at you, Olivia “I don’t know how much of school I’m gonna attend” Jade. Well, Olivia, maybe you’d feel differently if you learned about a certain someone named Benjamin Franklin, who founded the University of Pennsylvania in 1740 and also invented bifocals, the Warby Parkers of his day. You could say Ben was America’s first influencer. People already do, actually. It’s a thing. Tell your friends!

As long as you’re going to send a photo of your unathletic daughter on a rowing machine along with a check for $500,000 to a crew coach, why not send it to our crew coach? We have a river here. It’s pretty famous. Probably you’ve heard of it? The Schuylkill. Yes, that’s how it’s spelled. You say it like, skoo-kull. It’s a really lovely body of water and a great place for your daughter to pretend to be a coxswain while she just sits in a boat and vlogs. We would never have accepted the bribe, obviously, because that would go against our code of conduct. We hate crime; that’s why our law school is so good. But it would have been nice to be asked.

Paying $15,000 so the proctor will change your daughter’s SAT answers after she takes the test? Horrifying. But not as horrifying as going to such extreme lengths just to get your kid into USC when you could have sent those doctored transcripts to Philadelphia, PA. That’s where we’re located, just FYI. Like, you knew that already for sure but in case you’d forgotten: We’re in Philadelphia! What a town. It’s such an underrated city. Definitely better than wherever Wake Forest is. (Virginia? New Hampshire?) We’re biased but we can say, with total confidence, that Philly is better than New York. People say that all the time when they visit. They’re like, “Wow, this is so much cooler than I thought it was going to be! I guess my expectations were very low?”

A few days after the scandal broke, people started to talk about the Trumps and we were like FINALLY. But it turned out everybody was just giving Jared Kushner shit for paying $2.5 million to get into Harvard. HARVARD IS A GLORIFIED FINISHING SCHOOL. For fuck’s sake, what about all the money Trump promised he would donate to Penn so his daughter Ivanka and one of his dumb-dumb sons could go to Wharton?? Wharton is a Penn school, and sure, sometimes it bothers us that the Wharton brand is so strong while the Penn brand is still sort of confusing to a lot of people, but whatever. Tiffany went to the College of Arts and Sciences, by the way. At Penn.

Our only consolation in the face of this devastating news is that these criminals, whose schemes were a shameful violation of what is intended to be a fair, meritocratic process, will be brought to justice, **and that none of them bothered to scam their way into Cornell.**",college,325,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b34scv/statement_from_the_university_of_pennsylvania_on/,False,Sarcasm,17,[deleted] ,2019-03-20 07:47:19

9x58st,I think my posted exam score was wrong,"So I got a 90 on the first exam and for this test I felt the same about it, studied the same, and I was confident. Went through the test, maybe missed a few questions but still felt confident. I check online and it says I got an 18%... I’ve never got any score near that so I’m 95% confident it was a mistake. I possible had the answers shifted or my score was entered backwards (I got 18.1818% if i got the ones i missed right I would’ve got 81.8181%). I’ve emailed my professor, but is this sort of thing uncommon? And would I be able to check my Scantron for mistakes? Because if this 18% goes through, I’m done for and I know I didn’t get this score

eitwz9,Advice for managing returning-to-class jitters?,"Newbie to the sub here. I'm starting my third term in a little over a week and I am BEYOND stressed about it. For context, I am an animal science/biology major and I am working on core science classes that are required to take more specific classes. I completed my AA before going to a 4 year university so I don't really have room for filler classes to lighten my work load since I've pretty much taken all of them already. I did pretty good last semester academically, but my mental health took a turn for the worse and it made me just dread going to class every day.

So my issue is that I am having a real bad case of first day jitters even though this will be my third time starting classes. I am really dreading going back again and I really just cannot calm myself, just thinking about going back makes me nervous. I don't know how to cope since I wasn't nervous when I first started and I was completely fine going back the next semester, but now I'm literally freaking out.  I'm just looking for any tips I can get on how to cope and actually make it through going back without having a breakdown or something.

cfo9ba,How can I throw a successful college party?,"My college has a very isolated yet cliquey vibe with not much of a social life, and I really want to throw an event to bring my dorm hall (or even entire dorm building if I’m feeling ambitious) together for some fun. 

I’m thinking of starting with a back-to-school game-night party; we have a nice patio space that no one uses. I used to help set up movie nights at my old college as a member of Hall Council and most of them were successful, but we don’t have a hall council here, and I don’t know how to do this as a single hostess, or how to gather some organizing help. I’m also introverted, but I do open up at a good social event, so this will help me, as well.

What advice do you have to give for throwing a fun college party? How do I get a good amount of people to come? How do I keep them entertained so that they stay a while? Is there anyone that I should get permission from or any rules to follow? And how do I overall throw a good party, especially as the new kid that no one knows?

Also, what are some fundraising ideas, or how to have a good time for cheap? No hall council=no funds (our Rez life really is that sad).

It’s also important to note that because of regulations above me, I can’t bring or have alcohol.

gv8psc,I (19F) no longer wish to study abroad due to a multitude of reasons and want to pursue my dream of studying Psychology at home. My mom and dad feel as if they've failed as parents.,"So, I've finished my first year at Uni abroad (King's College London Digital Culture BA if anyone's interested) and have now realized that I don't feel happy or proud of myself in the slightest. It's not that the subject I'm studying is uninteresting or overly complicated; I simply don't feel drawn to it and, because it's so abstract and 'new', I can't see myself pursuing it professionally in the long run. Aside from that, being away from my home country and my loved ones has made me feel the most lost and depressed that I've ever felt, and it has heightened my anxiety issues as well as my eating disorder tendencies.

To give you a bit of background, I have always been the so-called 'perfect' child. Was always kind of a nerd, quiet and studious, got consistently good grades and was constantly told that studying abroad was undoubtedly the only path for me to evolve and grow into a successful and fulfilled person. This became especially prevalent once my parents discovered that my little brother (10) is mildly autistic, which happened when I was 11. From that point on, I always knew that I had to be perfect, I had to make everyone in my family proud. Even though what my family was telling me were essentially huge compliments and encouragements, for me, that translated into so much pressure that I never actually sat and asked myself what I wanted to do, what I envisioned for myself. I've never felt like I excelled at anything in particular academically, but was always encouraged into this creative side of academia because I have a way with words and enjoyed writing short stories, articles and occasionally poetry. I say 'enjoyed' because as you may have already guessed, this hobby of mine turned into something of a chore due to my parents' pressure into doing it. However, I've always known that I'm a huge people person and that I have a complex understanding of people's emotions and reasonings, being able to see beyond the surface and actually helping my friends overcome certain feelings and events. I've always felt as if this was my greatest quality.

These past few weeks I've had time to put things in perspective and I tried to analyze both pros and cons of pursuing this college versus staying home and starting Psychology in September. Given that I've always hid my true feelings from my parents fearing that I would disappoint them, I've had an incredibly difficult time even admitting it to myself that I'm not happy or thriving in my current situation.

Yesterday morning I finally gathered the courage to tell my parents about everything I've been experiencing, from the complete misery of being abroad to my intention of starting Psych at college in my home country. The conversation immediately started off on the wrong foot because my mother, without even trying to listen to what I had to say, got extremely angry and told me that I'm giving up on my dream in order to stay home with my boyfriend of one year (19M) because I fear him breaking up with me, and then telling me that she doesn't think I'm capable of making a decision without thinking about him as the primary factor of influence. Naturally, I was extremely hurt and offended; not only because it felt incredibly belittling, but because she didn't even give me a chance to speak and explain myself. She eventually apologized for this, but I will never forget it and I will surely keep in mind to never, ever tell my future child anything like it. Once I got the chance to tell them everything I've gone through, as well as the fact that I've always felt pressured to be a certain way and achieve the best academic results and performances, they told me that they feel as if they've failed as parents, because they didn't allow me to grow into who I wanted to be or educate me on how to make my own decisions. My mother (who has had issues with depression and has a tendency to be overly dramatic and feel as if everyone's blaming her for everything) said that I was blaming her for my depression, proceeded to have a crying fit and actually fainted. As you can imagine, the conversation ended there.

Currently, everyone's a lot more calm. We've decided that I will spend this summer weighing the pros and cons of each solution, while applying for the second year of student loans as well as applying for Psych here, so that at the end of August I can have both options available and decide what I want to do. I already feel like I'm making the right steps to finally feeling happy and content within myself and having my own dreams and plans as the no. 1 priority, but my parents are (understandably) still quite shocked and skeptical. However, my mom actually suggested that I visit a psychologist friend's office today and learn about how it works, which is an opportunity I'm very grateful for and excited about. I can feel that they both would rather I finish my degree at KCL still, but they seem to have this impression that getting a King's College diploma is hugely prestigious and opens a million doors for the future. Maybe they're right, but I don't want to achieve that at the risk of hating myself forever for not choosing my own happiness. My life here is actually what I want; why would I leave it, knowing that I'm miserable in London?

I hope that they'll eventually come around, but I'm still scared that they'll always feel like I'm a failure or that this is a cop-out. Making them proud is still super important to me, but for the first time in my life I want to put myself first. How do I make them understand that this has been my dream all along and how can I help them overcome the shock and this initial feeling of failing as parents? So far, the only people who've shown me complete, unconditional support (and actually said that they were proud of me) are my boyfriend and my best friend.

Thank you so much for reading and I'm looking forward to hearing your advice :) 

TL;DR I want to quit my college abroad and start studying a completely different subject at home, both because my life abroad is miserable and because the subject I'm currently studying is more my parents' dream rather than my own.

77q7g0,College is depressing.,"Just got back from getting dinner at a dining court and realized how alone I am. It’s a nice night, so I was surrounded by people with their friends going to parties and events. Now I’m just sulking in my room. It’s so painful to be surrounded by people having fun. I have tried everything to make friends including approaching people, joining clubs, etc. I just can’t do it. I know lots of people go through this, but it feels so alienating. I was pretty sociable in high school, so I’m not sure what my problem is now. I’m still in touch with a lot of my friends from back home, but I have no one here.

5pw4uw,Unusually practical guide for college (xpost from /r/applyingtocollege),"Hi everyone -- I'm a current college admissions counselor and I posted this on /r/applyingtocollege and was told that this subreddit would probably make use of it as well. So I hope they're right and that this does in some way improve your college life. Because of the nature of that sub it's geared slightly toward newer students, but I'm sure that people currently attending can get something out of it as well.

Here is my ""unusually practical guide for college."" It is arranged in no order at all and was completely improvised this evening. I've been carrying all of this around in my head and wanted to give real, concrete advice, rather than airy, head-space advice (like ""be open-minded!"") We're getting nitty-gritty here. 

Keep in mind that I've only been to one college. I was in English and Political Science. I tried to generalize this, but not everything will apply to every school, and I'm afraid a lot of it is writing-centric. I hope that some other former (or even current) college students can add to this, especially ones with stronger STEM backgrounds. 

And so: 

**Academic**

* While coffee is delicious, tea is better when consumed in mass quantities. If you're studying for finals, your body will feel much better on three cups of tea than it will on three cups of coffee. On that note, learn to eat fruits and vegetables if you don't right now. Your body will thank you. If you have access to unlimited food in the cafeteria, this is your time to try new things. 

* Get to know your faculty advisor quickly. Your school may assign one to you or you may get to pick, but whatever the system is, get on their radar as soon as you can. If they see an opportunity that needs students (research project, internship, whatever) they're more likely to send it to you if they know your name. They will also be better able to advise you if they know more about you.

* When working on group projects, if you're not using Google Drive, you're doing it wrong. Keep everything in there, even things that individual group members are working on and will share with the group later. You never know what can happen and so it's best to keep everything in a common space.

* Get organized. Somehow. I put every assignment and appointment in a Google Calendar and set daily ""to-dos."" Every Friday (or Thursday, because sometimes my weekends started on Thursdays, which was incredible) I created a list of everything I needed to do that weekend, and I stuck to it. Related:

* Use your weekends to your advantage. Things really slow down, so it's a perfect opportunity to jump-start a paper or a reading. 

* You don't have to read every word. Learn to skim. Skim the optional reading too -- it'll come in handy. 

* If you can, take notes on paper, not the computer. When you do this, you mentally siphon out the less important information in favor of the more important information because you can't write as quickly as you can type. This will make your notes more valuable later on.

* Take notes on what you read. Even short summaries like ""Skowroneck considers presidencies as part of long historical periods marked by prevailing ideologies established by certain presidents"" will make your life **much** easier when working on final papers. (Also, y'all should check out Stephen Skowroneck's theory of presidential leadership in political time -- it's fascinating.)

* Use the works cited page of books to your advantage. If you're struggling finding more information on a topic, that's your first port of call. 

* Learn how to write papers in ways that work for you. I always wrote whatever I wanted for the assigned length of the paper. Then I wrote a schematic of what had I puked onto the page, re-organized that schematic into a structure that actually made sense, and fleshed out key details and holes. Some people write a full outline and then start. Some people organize by scholar, case study, source text, or school of thought. Whatever you do, come up with something that works for you. 

* Ask for help. Your professor's office hours, a tutor, the writing center, the counseling center, your classmates. Nobody will think less of you. (Pro-tip: asking classmates for help means talking to the smartest people in your class, which also usually means the most interesting people. Talking to interesting people, I would argue, is the whole point of college.) 

* ""It's hard"" is a TERRIBLE reason to not take a class. The best classes I've taken have also been the hardest classes. ""It's Hard"" is also the name of a pretty bad album by The Who. 

* If you're in a program that lets you be undecided for a year or two, take advantage of that. If you see something that you don't know much about, don't write it off as uninteresting. 

* If you're working on a paper, don't stop your writing session at the end of a paragraph. Start the next paragraph and then stop. This way, when you sit back down to keep going, you don't have to putter about thinking ""how should I start?"" You will already have a beginning. 

* Find a pen you like. Mine is the Bic Grip Roller. I used to go with the Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine, but they leak sometimes. 

* Balance out your courses. If you have the opportunity to decide which classes you'll take which semesters, plan ahead and avoid loading a lot of hard classes into one semester. 

* If you have a class that only meets once or twice a week, find another time that week that you can treat like that class to do homework only for that class. For example, the year I did a thesis, I dedicated 9-12 every Friday morning to work for that thesis. I did a lot of other work for it throughout the week, but having a dedicated time to work on it really focused me. 

* You can revise your work much more effectively if you put 24 hours between the last time you worked on it and the time you started revising it. 

* Go to campus conversations and events about topics that are outside your subject area. Just because you're not studying it doesn't mean you shouldn't learn about it. This is the one time in your life where you will have the benefit of professors lecturing for free right outside your door. (Also, these events tend to have free food.)

* Keep a novel going to read for fun. I would start all of my library sessions just by reading a little bit for my own enjoyment. The idea was to get my brain going with a warm-up before I jumped into the work I would get graded on. Crosswords, Sudoku, and Chess are good alternatives to this if you're not much of a reader. 

* Find a hobby. It's really important to be able to do something that is productive but not academic. You won't feel bad about working on this thing, because it's productive, but you simply can't spend all of your time on your studies. I played a lot of music, but I know people who tried woodworking, knitting, yoga, improv comedy, and one guy with a unicycle. 

* Purchase a copy of *The Elements of Style*. Read it once at the beginning of each semester. If you carry it with you everywhere, you're not over-doing it.

**Social**

* Learn to make one large, shareable dish like a dip, lasagna, cake, or bowl of chili. There are a lot of pot lucks in college, and you will be well-prepared if you have a dish like this on standby. PM me for a bean dip recipe that people actually request of me when I go to stuff at their houses. 

* Go to parties with people you know. Make sure that you keep track of them and they keep track of you (and that you keep track of them) throughout the night. Walk each other home. 

* When considering campus opportunities, it easier to say yes and then say no than it is to say no and then yes. You can always try something once (a sport, a club, whatever) and then say ""you know, this isn't for me"" if it isn't for you. It's much harder to jump on things once they've started. 

* If you're at a party, never leave a drink unattended. Ever. 

* Set aside structured time to see the friends who mean the most to you. This can be an orientation group, people from your floor, whatever. College gets busy, and so ritualizing friendship makes it A) more frequent and B) more special, somehow. I know people who had ""family dinner"" with their closest friends every Sunday, and nothing got in the way. 

* You are not bound to your friends, especially the ones you make early on. I ditched my first-semester friends in January of my freshman year and it was one of the best choices I've ever made. They weren't bad people; we just had nothing in common. Don't be afraid to branch out.

* Branching out is scary and that's okay. 

* Do not judge anyone's character or personality (unless they do something very heinous) during their first semester. Everyone in the first semester is very desperate to be liked, and people tend not to do their best when they're under that kind of pressure. Let people (and yourself) mellow out a little bit before you start deciding who you like. This advice goes doubly for sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are passing judgment on incoming first-year students. 

* Find someone who you're close to who does not go to your school who you can call if you just need to vent. 

* Don't get that upset when most of your high school friendships collapse. It just happens.

* Give people room to change and become better people. College has a way of knocking people down a peg. If you meet someone who looks like they need that, check back on them in a year or two. 

* Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously. Otherwise, you'll end up like one of the people in the above tip.

* Being a campus celebrity is not that fun. It's better to just know a lot of people so you have a lot of friendly faces on campus that you can say hi to than it is to just be ""known."" It's also okay to just have a small group of people who you like. 

* Meet older students. It doesn't matter if you do it through clubs or sports teams or greek communities, but these people have all the key info on your school, like which classes and professors are good, where to go for really good Vietnamese food, and which improv groups to see. They will also invite you to the cooler parties. 

* If you're unhappy, make a change. Cut or change an extracurricular, start hanging out with different people, break up with that person. Just don't make changes indiscriminately -- try to find the root of your dissatisfaction and fix that.

When I was a freshman, my parents and family made it very obvious why I needed this item. 

But when I got there, other people didn't have them and I found it quite disgusting. 

You need to purchase bathroom / shower flip flops! Or shoes. Something to wear on your feet in the restroom.

8cxa29,Does anybody else feel like they are suffocating trying to live in a dorm with another person?,"I’m basically 500% done with it. Everytime I’m doing something I want to do alone my roommate walks in. Honestly always at the worst times. My blood pressure literally rises when she comes in the room because she stresses me out. She is very high energy and squeals and giggles a lot and sometimes handling that early in the morning or any other part of the day is hard. She’s also an international student so she doesn’t leave for breaks/weekends. Every waking day is spent with her. 

I like to be alone the majority of the time and dorm life has taken that away from me and put someone I can barely tolerate in its place. I don’t want to be mean to my roommate or anything, and I try to keep it nice and peaceful bc my logic for being annoyed with her is based solely on the fact that she exists. I can’t get away. It’s not escapable and it drives me crazy. I will just be relaxing in the room totally at peace and then she comes in and there goes that. I don’t want her to think I’m leaving the room because of her but when she comes back I have to get out or I’ll go crazy. Phew I just need my peacefulness back and I don’t know how to get it.

I need at least a full week to recharge from having to be around her all the time, and going home doesn’t count because that’s not exactly a vacation either. I stopped going home because home isn’t a happy place for me but now there’s no way for me to get a break.

7p901w,"Just had my first college class today, wanted to share my experience","So today I just had my first college class as a freshman at a community college, and I gotta say I had a blast. Because of that, I want to share my experience to hopefully help a future reader with his freshman year at college...

A year ago, I made a decision to go to college and to prepare for it as much as I could so that it would be one of the best experiences of my life. So I started browsing around this sub, watching youtube videos, reading blogs, and basically getting my hands on every college preparation resource I could.

I found a lot of very interesting tips and opinions, so I formulated my own ideas and goals and tried to stick with them as much as I could.

I woke up several hours before my first class so that I could have adequate time to have breakfast and to get to campus (it's a community college, so it has no dorms).

I arrived at the college one hour early, I made sure I knew where the classroom was, and then I sat down in some chairs outside of the classroom waiting for the class to begin. Since I'm an introvert, I tend to keep to myself and not be very social in public. But I promised that this time it would be different, so I gathered all the courage I had, and started talking to a guy that was sitting next to me. It ended up being a great conversation, we talked about the interests we shared and about our college experiences.

Ten minutes before the class I entered the classroom and I sat in the front row. The class was English Composition 1, the professor gave us an introduction to the class, went over the syllabus, and then he started with the class material right away. 

I tried to do the best I could to participate in class, answering the question the professor gave us and being an active listener.

During the class, I noticed which students were paying attention in class and being active participants, so that at the end I could walk up to them and try to start a study group with them.
 
After the class ended, I walked up to the professor and introduced myself. Then, I walked to a student who seemed to be interested in the class, and I told her about the study group. She ended up accepting and then proceeded to share her contact information with me. 

That was it! If you made it this far in the post, I love you, thank you for taking your time to read about my experience. I hope that if you are about to start college this post can help you.

I want to thank every person from this sub, you guys are great people.

TL;DR: Just had my first class today and had a blast, met my professor, and interacted with other students.

8e3yh6,Should I be worried?,"Last night, I was watching a movie in the common room of my friend's dorm building. There were about ten people I knew there fairly well, and then a girl off to the corner that I wasn't familiar with at all. While we were waiting for the movie to load, I made a joke that was definitely bordering on insensitive and distasteful. I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong, because I did; everyone behaves differently when with a group of friends.

Amidst the laughter, the girl in the corner called me out for what I had said, saying it was something that should never be joked about it. She ended her speech with, ""and I'm an RA, so..."" Not looking for an argument, I quickly apologized, explained that it was a touchy subject that I myself have lived through, and left it at that. Everyone did a great job at moving the conversation forward to make it less awkward for me, but the girl kept stewing in the corner. I could physically feel her staring at me all night.

Throughout the course of the night, she kept making references to how much she liked the authority of her position, how much satisfaction she got out of writing up reports on people with infractions, that sort of thing. I thought it was very unprofessional for someone in her position, but besides that, incredibly worrisome.

Finals start in basically a week and a half. The last thing I want to worry about some RA who I was never formally introduced to gunning for me because of a joke. Has anyone been in this sort of situation with an RA flexing their power? Did they follow through with their promises? If she were to report me, what sort of thing should I expect? I've never had any disciplinary hearings or anything like that.  

EDIT: I'll just throw out what I said, since a handful of people have asked. We were watching *The Dark Knight Rises*, and I remarked something along the lines of, ""Batman would have a whole other set of problems if it was called *The White Knight Rises*."" The RA assumed I was being racist until we explained the definition of a ""white knight"" on the internet, and she grew even more furious upon hearing the meaning.

aeq21n,Advice on school/work full time... No high school experience at all,"I'll be attending college for the first time this spring semester. I've been out of school for over a decade and I've never actually attended high school. Naturally, I'm pretty nervous.

Unfortunately, I haven't been in school since 8th grade. I have no experience writing essays/projects/presentations or even being in any type of upper-level classroom setting. I've studied for the last 6mos or so to learn what I need to pass the GED tests. My goal was to pass and go to college and get a better job. 

I'm registered for online Intro to Biology, a developmental math class which is also online and a campus English class from 6 pm to 8:40 pm once a week. It's 11 credits and i work fulltime M-Th 6 am to 4:30 pm. I have 3 days off. 

I know many students take much more than this but I feel I'm literally jumping into this blind. I have written a total of 2 ""essays"" in my life and that was in middle school. (English is what I'm most worried about. It takes me a ridiculous amount of time to write anything at all and I'm not too thrilled about presentations and all that) I have no credit whatsoever, so I have to take all the intro courses and my major is very science heavy. I want to graduate on time but I cannot quit my job. I'm torn between taking it slow because of work and going head-on with school and work full-time. I self-studied everything from the bottom up to pass the GED. I can handle my time efficiently. I'm most worried about doing well in my classes. 

Has anyone jumped into college-level classes with little to no high school experience? Is 11 credit hours too much my first semester? If anyone could tell me their thoughts about my situation... if you yourself or you know someone in a similar position. Thoughts? Advice? 

&#x200B;",college,300,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/aeq21n/advice_on_schoolwork_full_time_no_high_school/,False,,35,"Math can be really hard if you don't get it and require a lot of time to learn. I was always at the math center asking the most dumbest questions everyday after class. So really use your recourses cause math classes at University are waaaay more brutal and not as helpful at community tbh.

Graduated high school in the bottom 20% and droped my senior year math once I turned 18 cause I just didnt care for math. Decided to get my shit together at 23 and now I'm 26 taking calculus 3. Long journey and a lot of studying. 

I wouldn't work full time and have math and biology at the same time. Also, online classes are WAY harder.  Community college teachers are more forgiving and understand of your situation more than you would think. So really talk to them about your situation. 

You need to look up your teachers before you sign up for them. Use ratemyprofessor.com ! Honestly had 2 college algebra teachers I had to drop before census day because they really didn't give a shit about explaining things. Ended up taking college algebra one wintermester all because I had 2 very bad teachers. Iwould strongly avoid the math teachers that also teach in high school! They come to class really tired at the end of day, bless their hearts for wanting to have two jobs and do better, but they really suck and you can't waste your semester and drop limits on them because they just want that extra coin and you don't have anymore time. 

For some dumb ass reason, I believed my older white guy friend, that if I was failing a class to not drop ""just finish it out cause you already paid for the class"" . UHM, drop the class cause University averages the two grades together. Yes, at community college they just replace the bad with the better grade, but uni adds them together and averages them. So your GPA for uni and community are two different numbers if that were to happen. 

that's just my experience and what I wish I knew because I'm a minority and literally don't know anything about college. Also, I'm a computer science major and only took 1 eng class that had no essay requirements, just a weekly read and write a summary of what I read. So no essay experience for me either. Good luck!!

eltgxx,I need help figuring what to do after failing my probationary semester and am about to lose all my financial aid.,"Last Spring 2019 I took 18 units (9 classes because I'm a music major) and had to drop 2 courses late in the semester with the help of my assistant dean. I was undergoing severe depression/ptsd/psychosis and was in the process of changing meds because the previous one had weight gain side effects. I lost eligibility for financial aid but they let me do a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal (SAP) which is basically like a probation to regain elgibiltiy:I had to maintain a minimum gpa of 3.0 and pass 75% of the attempted units.

But I ended up not passing the probation. Last Fall 2019 I took 12 units (7 classes) and didn't pass 2 classes (4 units failed). Depression got worse during that time, abusive family situation got worse, my therapist quit and I was stuck with intern therapists that didn't help much, and the new meds I was taking had severe drowsiness side effects and I was hella tired all the time. But it's still on me and I fucked up bad.

This means I'm going to lose my future financial aid and if I want to continue college for another 2 years to be a music teacher, I'm gonna have to pay $3500 semester tuition out of pocket in monthly payments. I couldn't work in 2019 because I didn't have the mental energy to do so and do school full time unlike previous years where I did work part time and do school. I have no fucking idea how I'm gonna be able to manage to work 20 hours a week to pay $700 of tuition a month and attend school at least part time if I couldn't even do school by itself. My dad who was the income earner of the family recently got kidney dialysis and is currently trying to get disability coverage but for now cannot help with those payments.

7zieym,"Recently graduated. Here are some tidbits of ""wisdom"" I picked up over my time as an undergrad.","1): It's *okay* to skip class, but you have to be methodical about it. If your professor is basically just reading aloud from a textbook that you can read yourself, a skip now and then is fine if you need to work on something else or if you're genuinely exhausted and need to rest a little (You're not going to get much from a lecture in that state anyway). 

2): Sometimes ""studying smarter"" is accepting the fact that you have a janky professor who contrives exams out of thin air, and not wasting time studying material that you and everyone else knows will NOT be on the exam. I'm not saying you shouldn't study *at all* in cases like this, but you need to allocate your time using common sense.

3): No matter how introverted you are, try and get least least one texting buddy per class. It helps to have someone to discuss the material with, and it can be a Godsend on homework sometimes.

4): Virtually everyone procrastinates, so don't feel guilty about it. That said, a lot of procrastination comes from simple psychological walls that are easily gotten rid of (keeping your books in your bag as opposed to taking them out when you get home, for instance).

5): If you're planning on going to grad school, be proactive asking professors for reference letters ahead of time, and don't wait until your last year/semester. Waiting isn't really a big deal if you did well in the class and know the professor, but if you're proactive, it makes the whole process of collecting references less of a task when the witching hour comes.

6): It's perfectly okay to have a good time every now and then for the sake of the ""college experience"", but never forget why you came to school to begin with. I've seen too many people with great potential post images and videos of themselves on social media at frat parties almost every night (And as you might guess, not many of them finished school).  ",college,291,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7zieym/recently_graduated_here_are_some_tidbits_of/,False,,26,"1) is terrible advice. It's a slippery slope that can make you spin out of control. If it's okay to skip this one class because (insert your excuse here) then it's okay to skip class because (insert some other worthless excuse).

Always try to make it to every class. Even if you just go and tune out the professor to work on homework. Having structure to your day will keep you more productive and by attending class you'll be less likely to miss ""gotcha"" announcements like rescheduling of exams, new assignments, etc.

The rest of the advice is okay though.

881dll,The study strategy I used to succeed in Grad school,"A recent grad student, I used the following technique to learn fast and study much more effectively. I wanted to share this strategy with others who are going into exam season :)

The Feynman technique was developed by Richard Feynman, a Nobel prize-winning physicist known as the great explainer. The Feynman technique is a mental model that allows average people with little knowledge in a subject to understand it quickly and retain their newly acquired knowledge. Richard Feynman was not born a genius or even with a higher than average IQ and in fact he was quoted saying “I was just a normal person who studied hard”. While Richard as an individual was average, his ability to clearly explain difficult and complex topics was far beyond average. This learning technique was the foundation for his greatness and something you should learn if you want to become more efficient when gaining knowledge.

In this article, I will explain the Feynman technique, which you can use to:

• Understand ideas that you don’t really “get”
• Remember ideas that you can understand but forget on tests
• Minimize your study time by learning and mastering information in less than 20 minutes and retaining this information for years to come!

Now, let’s look at the four steps of the Feynman Technique:

► Pick a topic and start studying
The first step in this technique is to pick a topic and begin to write down everything you know about the topic. As you continue your studies, you must add the new pieces of knowledge to your page and eventually you will begin to have a good listing of all the ideas that relate to your topic of interest.

► Pretend to teach your topic
It has been said that you don’t really understand a topic until you can teach it. Teaching the material you are trying to learn has two benefits. Firstly, it forces you to simplify the ideas you are trying to comprehend since you cannot relay the concepts to another person word for word. Secondly, when you attempt to relay the newly learned information to another individual you are better able to gauge your level of understanding and find holes in your comprehension. If you do find weaknesses in your understanding you can then move onto step number 3.

► Improve your areas of weakness
Identifying weaknesses in your comprehension is essential to mastering a subject. While teaching the material, jot down your areas of weakness and refer back to your materials to fill in the gaps. Once you have reviewed your shortfalls you can then take another attempt at teaching them until they become engrained in your mind.

► Simply and analogize
To move along your mastering of the new subject, you should be trying to simplify the content you are learning. The more you can distill complex concepts, the easier it will be for you to keep the ideas straight in your mind. Furthermore, if you can keep things simple, you will have an easier time explaining the topic to others as they will lack the insight that you’ve amassed over time. This simplification step allows you to retain the information in the long term as the content will not weigh as heavy in your mind as you will have it understood at the most refined level avoiding the annoyance of learning material only to forget it days later.

Obviously, i'll be in school at a bachelors level for quite some time. I'm just curious, are there are any signs or 'red flags' that one should not be pursuing related fields? I am not particularly in depth in any of my fields. I've passed Calc III and any pre-requisites with straight A's, however taking discrete math proofs and linear algebra, the work is getting really difficult. ESPECIALLY in proofs. Now I have some flexibility, if I choose, to change my course of study. I absolutely love learning mathematics as a whole and applying it to physics and so forth. How do I really know it IS for me and how could I determine if I or others can really do it? The work is getting difficult and i'm not sure if I have the energy to keep it up.",college,278,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fcuvre/red_flags_for_pursuing_a_stem_degree/,False,,28,"Like some of the other comments, try NOT to take the difficulty in the intro level math courses (like linear algebra) as a red flag!! If you are interested in a field like astrophysics, then I’m assuming you appreciate the application of mathematical concepts to physical sciences. The intro level math courses are tough because rather than synthesizing a real/applicable connection between math and physics, it actually separates the two (in my mind). I would say keep trucking through these intro math classes, I have a feeling that once you get to higher level physics courses you will understand these same concepts you once thought were difficult based on the fact that you are applying them scientifically/within your field of interest! 

As you progress and begin to take the high level courses (quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, etc.) that is a good time to take a step back and actually think about “red flags”. If, as you engage with mathematical concepts in physics settings, you are still struggling to understand the math, then you may want to consider revising your path. HOWEVER, that being said, math is HARD, especially at these high levels! So it will take some time to commit to understanding it, so don’t give up so easily. My only point is that physics and math will always be hard, but once you understand it in a way that suits you, it will be so much better. Intro math classes are tough because they lack that aspect.

For context, I am a physics major and a math/CS minor. I got to the high level/grad physics classes and forgot everything I ever learned about math in those intro classes. But the advanced physics classes essentially take what you know/have learned and apply it to an entirely new area, which was extremely helpful for me.

I don’t know how to ask them or what to do about it. 
As a senior I feel nervous about how I’ll pay because I am the only kid in the city I live In who’s parents won’t pay for college, no one around me is worried about paying for college so I either get judged or nobody understands...*how do I pay for college?*

But it is what it is now, so you have to deal with it. If you can prove to FAFSA that you are emancipated from your parents (i.e. receive no aid from them whatsoever) you may be considered low income. You'll need evidence in the form of written notes from your parents stating thus and letters of references. I don't know how often they grant this status. I received it because my parents disowned me for my sexuality and refused to give me any support but they made a lot so I didn't qualify for much aid.

As others have mentioned you will have to go to community college for the first two years. Each you should apply to dozens of scholarship applications. And then transfer into the cheapest state college you can find unless you can get a full ride scholarship. You'll also need to take out federal loans, and grants. ",2018-09-15 20:49:17
8osqil,Didn't get into major I wanted but unqualified friend did... Don't know what to do,"So I go to a really good public school where we declare/apply for our majors usually the end of second year. I was going to major in Global development Studies, which only has the pre-reqs of Econ 1 or 2, and a ""global"" class. I took Econ and got an A in it, and 2 global classes and also got A's. I worked reallyyy hard for that. I also volunteered a lot with and did a lot of migrant work relating to what I want to do with this major and career. I applied for the major... and was not accepted. The rejection email was an unformatted, quick email that literally said ""Sorry, you weren't accepted to ___ major. Our applicant pool was great and we regret to inform you of this decision."" 
I was devasted, but even more hurt when I found out who did get in. 

A girl I know here had a rough start to college. She had a 1.2 GPA first semester, then a 3.4 GPA 2nd semester, then a 2.2 GPA 3rd semester. We both were in the ECON class 3rd semester and she got an F, despite literally cheating on a lot of assignments. She didnt take Econ 2 and wasnt in ANY clubs or jobs related to this major. Some ppl apply to this major because it has less requirements to complete and that was the reason she did as well. She is rich and her dad is an alumnus who knows 2 directors of the program (she told me this). She applied with a ~2.3 GPA and incomplete PRE REQ to apply and was waitlisted. She told me she's going to get in because she's going to speak to the directors... and then she was accepted. 

THEN, there are study abroad trips related to the major, and she was selected (min 3.0 GPA to even apply) to a major-related program for the summer.


I'm honestly so confused and hurt. I always knew that people in this school had connections to get ahead but this was the major I really wanted and though I know she probably didn't take my spot, I'm really really hurt and I feel disgusted by this school. But my school is known for things like this, connections giving people opportunities over others, and there was a scandal with a ""watch list"" for applicants from big donor families. I don't even know if I should speak to someone at my school about this or not or just take my loss.

EDIT: Reading this back, it sounds really pretentious. I don't think I'm owed a spot and to call her unqualified sounds strange.

838cpa,"During the midterm, a student awkwardly began berating the professor...","It's definitely that time of year.

Class difficulty ramps up quickly, exams pile up, and grades may or may not be going one's way. This is a particularly hard semester for me, but I wouldn't imagine having an audible breakdown during an exam, let alone directed at the professor.

It was the Differential Equations midterm, and it had a disturbingly low amount of questions. There were only four! But hey, it didn't seem so bad. Two substitution problems, one multi-part slope field analysis problem, a separable population equation problem, and a separable newton's law of cooling problem. I thankfully did the review and practiced the latter two problems, so I wasn't caught off guard by anything.

One of my classmates, however, was.

Each time he went up to the professor for a question, his tone became more distressed and beleaguered. He was speaking fairly loudly by the second (or third) time he approached the teacher. Before long, he began calling the professor dishonest for not making the review like the exam, and explained how much it ""stressed him out and gave him anxiety"". Christ, he was going on and on, and the professor took 100% of it! Every second he spoke was a lethal dose of cringe...I couldn't focus.

Then, when the exam finished, the student *gave even more* to the professor! He kept going on and on...but kudos to my professor for keeping his cool and tolerating that dude's sass.

99i4ra,At what point do I become worried about my roommate's introverted nature?,"Hello, I am a freshman that just moved into his dorm in college and i love it so far. I do have a concern for my roommate though. Just from texting I knew he was a quiet guy shy guy, which I have problems with myself so I completely get it. He told me more in detail about that when we met, saying how hes very introverted, didnt have plans to party or go to football games etc etc.  and I told him I would give him space if he wanted but if he ever wanted to go to the gym or out somewhere I would be happy to go. 

Its been 3 days now and I'm almost positive he has only left the room once, and that was to take a math placement exam. All hes been doing is sleeping playing video games, watching anime, or doing summer review work(so basically like your average redditor). For meals he has a fridge of stuff and really likes peanut butter sandwiches. He still showers and stuff but I am worried about him.

cw64pp,Part Two of A Former Student’s Top Tips for College,"Well since my first college tips post blew up so much I thought I would make a second list of college tips from a recent graduate that I thought of the last few day. 

Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cug62h/a_former_students_top_tips_for_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

1. Make Friends with People a Semester or Two Ahead of You

They can give you great advice on what professors to take and can give you their old test/ notes. Also you may be able to get textbooks (PDF or Book Versions) off of them which will save you a ton of money. 


2. Create a LinkedIn Account your Freshman Year and Add as Many Students as You Can Throughout Your Degree

Don’t worry about not having anything to put on there. Just add some class projects that you  have worked on, your high school part time job, and/or some softwares that you have used. The point of the Linked In account college is not to show what you have done but to make connections for later on in your career. Just add as many people as you know on there so when you do have something to show they will see it. There are many people that you will forget about and who will also forget about you so make those everlasting connections on social media early. College students are more likely to add you when they first create a LinkedIn than when they have a job and never check it. I would even say add the people that you are friends with on other social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, or what ever the kids are using now days. The more other people see you, the more likely they are to remember you when it matters. 
Also take the time to take a good profile picture. You don’t have to be in a suit. All you need is  something professional and you can update the picture as you upgrade your wardrobe. Almost any phone camera can take a decent picture now days so have a buddy take a picture of you on a plain background. What ever you do don’t use a selfie for your LinkedIn Profile pic. 


3. Sit in the Front Row

Sitting in the front row helps you get more involved in the class since you are right up next to the professor. People sitting in the front row are generally more engaged in the class and are willing to talk to you for networking purposes. Also the professor will more likely see your face so they are likely to remember you if you go and talk to them. All the intelligent people I knew in my classes sat in the first two rows so if you wanted to try and make friends in the class this may be a good place to try and make friends. 


4. Always Submit Documents in PDF and not in Word Format. ESPECIALLY RESUMES 

The main reason for this is that with a pdf the format of your document will not get messed up so it will look better. Second reason is the person grading it will not be able to see all the metadata (time document was first created, how long the document was worked on, and when it was last revised). I actually had professors call students out based on their metadata. Third reason is a pdf is a lot easier to work with for a grader when they are attempting to grade it. 

5. Buy a refurbished computer/tablet on amazon instead of buying one new. 

To save a bunch of money I got a refurbished powerful dell computer from amazon that was plenty powerful enough to run my programs. I also got a refurbished tablet so I could take notes on. I would also recommend getting a tablet because it was nice to be able to copy the example from the pdf book or lecture notes directly to my notes and write out the solution. It was also great because I never had to buy another notebook again.

3gcp84,How I won over $100k in scholarships (by somebody who isn't getting paid to market to you),"Last year, I earned enough private scholarships to completely pay my four year 18k/year tuition plus living expenses - but it was hard because there were barely any genuine resources to help me find them. My guidance counselor also literally told me *not* to apply to a scholarship I ended up winning. It really pisses me off that there are so many shitty blogs and companies trying to make a buck off of students trying to find money for college, so here are my *real* tips for finding scholarships. I've posted this as a comment to a few posts, but hopefully it will reach more people like this.

Finding scholarships:

* Focus on small local scholarships that won't have many applications - these are the scholarships people always say don't even get claimed because nobody applies to them. If you're in/near a major city, there is probably a specific Community Foundation that indexes and manages many of them. Check [this website](http://www.cof.org/community-foundation-locator) to find one for your neighborhood. You can also try just googling ""[My City/State] Scholarships"" and looking through the first 5-10 pages to see what comes up.
* If you are religious, check with your pastor and the local/state/national governing bodies of your religion. Check with the bosses and websites of you and your parent's workplaces. See if the local library has resources. Ask the teachers at your high school.
* Once you begin college, check with your professors and your major's department office. If you attend a research university, grants for independent research projects are another good way to get money for school - check with the Honors College, Office of Undergraduate Research, or similar offices.
* [Cappex](http://www.cappex.com) was great for me because it has the most ways to sort through their thousands of scholarships (as opposed to FastWeb). It also has settings where you can sort by lack of competition and length of applications/essays.
* If you fit the requirements, you can apply. I got a scholarship funded and named after a football tournament even though I'm a girl that's never played sports in her life. Read the fine print before you write things off.
* Don't underestimate scholarships that don't list how much they're worth. I applied to one thinking it'd be like $500 and it turned out to be $12k renewable.
* Apply to as many as possible, but remember that it's not possible to apply to all of them. You only have so much time, so prioritize it wisely and focus on ones you actually have a serious shot at winning. 

Application tips:

* Fill out your FASFA as soon as it opens in january, because lots of other scholarships will ask for it.
* Turn in scholarships early! Begin looking for spring NOW!
* Draft your essays and get *at least* two people at school to look over them. Read it out loud. Make a draft that's longer than the essay supposed to be, and find bad parts to take out after finishing the draft.
* Be sure to include something in your essays about how the career you're going into will help the community. If you're undecided, just pick one to write about because they know that over 50% of kids switch majors anyway. Obviously don't apply for scholarships specifically for a major you have no interest in, but if it you're just deciding between a couple careers write about the one that is most in-tune with the scholarship.
* Begin getting close to at least 3 teachers/coaches/guidance counselors at the beginning of the year for rec letters, or stay in contact with your old ones. When you ask for rec letters, give them a resume (if you don't have a resume yet, make one!) as well as all the information about what the scholarship is for and where they need to send it. Make copies if you can.
* This should go without saying, but make sure your applications are neat! I have terrible handwriting, so I took the printed copies of applications I found and scanned them to my computer so I could type on them. Things like bad handwriting/scratching stuff out, not following basic instructions, forgetting one of the listed items (like a transcript or even a picture), and not spending the extra $1.50 to mail a manilla envelope (folding everything into a tiny envelope) makes a more of a difference than you would think. It shows that you're unprofessional and don't care.

I am a 3.9 GPA Mechanical Engineering student in my 2nd year, and over the years I have developed some very helpful and efficient methods for notetaking. 

Before I start, I will say that taking notes this way will require slightly more paper be used up, but at the end of the day it's worth it.

1) Write notes in small sections, starting with the main point, then bullet points off of that, then bullet points off of that, etc etc.

2) In between EACH section, leave 2-3 lines of space in between.

3) Leave 5 lines of blank space at the bottom of each page.

This is my technique for building up on notes. Use the format I just described for taking notes during a lecture. Use the lecture as a general introduction of the topic. Now, many teachers have some material that they are basing their teaching off of, whether it be a powerpoint or a textbook. After a lecture is done, take a look through your powerpoint/ textbook, and add information into each small section, where the 2-3 spaces were provided. Use the bottom 5 lines if you run out of room in one of the other sections, or if you would like to add an example problem from homework that you think is important, or that you might forget later.

A couple more tips:

4) Don't be afraid to write little notes to yourself, even if they seem unorthodox. You are your own best communicator.

5) DON'T forget chapter headings. They will help attach the content to your thought processes. This is more crucial than you would think. You are much more likely to remember what ""Fluid Dynamics"" is than ""Chapter 24"".

Overall, big theme here is leaving yourself a lot of space on your first time taking notes. You want to build up on those notes, so instead of just adding extra papers later, which will get very confusing, it's nice to set aside room to work with for later on.",college,273,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5n6dr7/my_college_notetaking_guide/,False,,30,May we get an photo of your guide and see how it looks at least? ,2017-01-11 01:36:25

bwt5j2,"I’m two years into college and I want to change my major, but I have absolutely no background in the major I want to switch to","Sorry if this is a little long this is a complex issue for me and I need to get it all out. TLDR at the bottom if you’re lazy and don’t want to read the whole thing.

I’m currently a sophomore in college studying chemical engineering because I was told that since I was good at math and science, I should major in ChemE. I believed that for a while. I tried joining clubs and talking to professors, but I every time they got to talking about career paths as a ChemE I always zoned out to think about other things that interested me. I figured that it was just my adhd acting up. That it was my fault I couldn’t pay attention while others were readily listening. So I stuck with the major for two years. It has been affecting my grades (having difficulty finding motivation to study), my ability to interact with others (since I can’t find interest in my own major it’s a little hard to find common ground with people within my major), and most importantly it’s been negatively affecting my mental health (I can’t really see a future for myself within chemical engineering, so I’ve been feeling hopeless and depressed).

Recently I started volunteering in lab within my major (still ChemE) which I thought would inspire a desire to go to grad school since I can’t see what I would enjoy doing with just a bachelor’s degree. Again I fell behind because I couldn’t pay attention. And that resulted in me being afraid to ask questions and I kinda started trying to be as invisible as possible, which I think is largely due to social anxiety and a fear of being to harshly judged.

I started seeing a therapist to deal with the social anxiety, and as a result I’ve cared less about how people see me and have become more active within the lab. the last few days I’ve enjoyed it more because I am much more comfortable asking questions and talking to others within the lab since I am less afraid that they see me as baffoon for not paying attention in the earlier weeks. The only problem is, I still can’t bring myself to read more articles and learn more about about what is going on within the lab. I have a much better understanding of the content (so I have the ability to do the readings), but I just can’t find the motivation to do it.

The therapy also got me thinking about why I am so uncomfortable within my major, and got me started thinking about what I am actually interested in. I feel like I am a creative person, and a lot of the time when I am supposed to be paying attention in class, my mind wanders to how I would make a game out of what we’re learning. I took a intro to C++ class a couple semesters ago and I went out of my way to see how many alternative ways I could solve the homework problems rather than following the instructions, and for the most part the class, outside of the lecture, really clicked within my brain. I was never trying to avoid doing the assignments and was always looking for creative ways to complete them. I didn’t tend to zone out while trying to learn either, like I had a habit of doing with chemical engineering.

I also found myself watching a lot of videos on YouTube a while back about timed game making competitions using coding and was really fascinated by the methods the people used to develop their games. 

What I want to do is switch my major from chemical engineering to computer science and specialize in game development but there are 3 problems:

1. I’m already 2 years into chemical engineering, and it’ll probably take 4 additional years to complete a major in  computer science. That’s a lot of time to spend.

2. I am probably one of the more technologically inept people you’ll meet at the moment. The only coding experience I have is a little bit in my first semester, and the intro to C++ class that I mentioned earlier. I get confused easily when people talk about software and how their computer works but I’m willing to ask questions. I’m working on caring less about how people view me and how judgemental they may be. Since I have goals and aspirations I think approaching professors and people already working within the field will be easier than it was in ChemE, which I had a crippling fear of.

3. I also would be walking into the major with a blank resume. Almost none of the stuff that I have done so far relates to video game design, so I’d imagine getting internships or coops related to my field would be difficult as well.  

I’d imagine that making the transition between the two majors would not be smooth at all. There’s a lot of changes that I’ll have to make, but I honestly think it will be worth it if I can be happy doing the career that I end up in. I’m sure that this is what I want to do, the question is how do I go about this transition? Where do I start? I want to try and build my resume as soon as possible I’ll take any help I can get.

Thank you all very much.

TLDR: Don’t see a future for myself in chemical engineering so I want to switch to video game development, which I do have aspirations in, but I am the most technologically inept person you might meet. Please help me figure out how to make this transition.",college,266,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bwt5j2/im_two_years_into_college_and_i_want_to_change_my/,False,,58,Grow a pair of balls dude ,2019-06-05 03:49:09

It makes me sad honestly. I came into college hoping and expecting to foster similar, loyal, and trustful friendships as I did in high school but that hasn’t been the case.

My friends in college are good people and honestly hilarious, but I don’t think they really care about being close friends with me. On the other hand, I’m still very close with my friends from high school and it feels weird to be so accepted in one group, but sort of irrelevant in another.

Anyone have any similar experiences?

9iw2y1,My method of studying as a senior biology major!,"Hi everyone, I'm a senior biology major and thought I'd share my studying method to those of you out there who wonder ""how bio majors do it"". For those of you taking biology classes, please don't drown in hopelessness about how hard the exams are or that you're gonna fail. You can do it as long as you're studying often and effectively. I started out as a clueless freshman failing all of her exams, but I survived and only have 2 semesters left!!

Here's my studying method that I've refined over the past few years:

1. **Get enough sleep**. Yes I know it's hard, but do it. There's no sense in going to class if you're so tired that you can't pay attention. If you're not focused then you can't take effective notes, and that will naturally lower your quiz and exam scores later on.
2. **Take effective notes during lecture**. No, don't write down everything the powerpoint slide says word for word if you already have access to that online. Print the powerpoint slides and take them to class (or use a tablet like me), then write notes on them. Prioritize the fine details that your professor is spending a lot of time on. 
3. **Ask to record your professor's lectures**. If they give you permission, record every lecture and sit as close to the front as possible for best recording quality. You can do this with free voice recording apps on any phone or tablet. If you use a tablet to take notes with, find an app that records too. (*This really helps with the next step!*)
4. **Rewrite your notes** **at the end of each week of lecture**. I like to do this in a notebook, but typing is fine too. Use the recordings to help you while you do it, by either listening to the entire recording for each lecture or just using it to revisit a topic you don't completely understand. Since rewriting notes is time consuming, it's a good idea to keep up with it by setting aside time at the end of each week. If you get behind, then it will just feel like a chore.
5. **Make a study guide to prepare for exams**. This doesn't have to be fancy, just use blank pieces of copy paper to rewrite key concepts and definitions from your notes that have a high chance of being on the exam. Focus on what's important and get rid of the fluff. Make it as detailed as you want, depending on how detail-oriented previous quizzes or exams were like. If you have extra time before taking the exam, reread your study guides. It's a good idea to keep a planner and give yourself a fair amount of warning before exams creep up.

This is the basics of what I do. Here's how to modify it for upper-level biology classes:

6. **Write down everything you know about each key concept on blank pieces of paper**. Without using your notes. Trying to write from memory will really tell you how much you actually know, and can help you visualize what you need to work on. This is especially helpful for exams that have all short-answer questions. 

7. **Network with other people in your class**. Oftentimes I had stingy professors that never really helped me when I had questions, so it's really important to ask other people in the class for help when you need it.

\*\* Make sure you're asking a specific question about something, not just ""omg I don't get this at all."" No one can help you if you don't even know what you don't know. If that makes sense?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I'm a senior bio major and this is how I study. Hours of rewriting things! Yes, I have pretty much no social life and all I do is study, but that's what I signed up for. Other bio majors have different methods, but all of us make study guides before every exam, pretty much.

awvwcr,Last semester of college. Should I take a break?,"Hi guys. I am an international business relations student, currently living in Western Europe. Im just about to start my 6th semester, after which I am going to recieve my bachelor's degree. I don't play on continuing my college education after acquiring this degree.

To be completely honest I dread going to school everyday. I made some friends, but most of them have already finished their studies. Most of the courses are purely theoritical so it's the same old bullshit I've been fed for entirety of my education, which doesn't bring any practical knowledge. I study with people who are more than happy to work for some big corporation. That's not me. I'd much rather have my own small business and make most of the decisions myself, rather than have to listen to someone else tell me what to do. Im burned out after studying for the past 15 years of my life. I struggle with some anxiety issues and they intensify drastically due to my studies. It's a vicious cycle of me skipping classes, almost failing, then having to put in extra work to even stay afloat. It's just exhausting.

Oh yeah also my dad paid quite a lot for my college education so I feel like I have an obligation to actually finish it.

 I know this may seem really dumb but i'm thinking about taking a break from college right now before the last semester. There's only one big obstacle - my dad.

I insist that they don't understand how tired I am. They think that because they were in college once, they know what it's like. Things were different then. They don't get that. You're family probably won't either. They think that you should finish just because you're so close and that if you spend time away that you won't want to go back. How do they know? We shouldn't be expected to take their word for it. I'd say take the break. It will help you recover from burnout quicker than ""managing it"" while still in school. ",2019-03-04 01:02:39
86u8qx,Anybody else have friends but no core friend group in college?,"I used to have a solid friend group freshman year that I could always rely on to do things with. Now that I'm a sophomore, it seems like everyone has separated and is doing their own thing. I've only stayed close friends with 3 people from that group, who are my roommates now. However, I only actually ever do things/hang out on weekends with one of them, because the other two are always busy/doing their own thing. They only hang out with us when it's convenient for them. I've tried reaching out to some of my old freshman friends, but most of them have their own friend groups now and those that don't never want to go out on weekends. I'm grateful that I have a best friend who I can count on for anything, but on days when she's busy/not here I can't help but miss that old friend group. My best friend is perfectly content with only having one close friend (me) by the way, and says she's not really interested in making new friends, so working on it together isn't really an option. I'm currently trying to make new friends but haven't succeeded yet. And even if I do manage to make a new friend, it still won't be the same as having that dependable core friend group.

We had split off into groups (which we do nearly every day) and then the professor stopped us and began to talk about what we could do to improve our scores in the future. However, there were two people in one group talking in the back. She stopped talking and said that she will not  bother talking over us and dismissed us all despite only being halfway through class, then let us know we were falling behind, and that we would meet again next time to start the next chapter.

I'm kind of in shock. My grade is now hinging on the behavior of a few bad eggs in class. She hadn't even finished her review despite that every other class got this review.

88sfp2,Who here had a much harder time making friends in college than in high school?,"I graduated years ago, and I did have trouble making friends. If you had the same problem, were you able to handle that? We couldn't keep up with each others' schedules, and despite the university having roughly 20k students, the classes themselves that I took were mostly tiny. And it was hard to relate to those students. Plus I'd rather go bowling, eat out go to the movies or play Street Fighter at someone's home than go to bars or go clubbing which was promoted a lot in college.

Mostly, though, maybe also because I commuted to college. I didn't live in a college town. This was my hometown growing up so I took the city train every day and it felt more like high school in that way. Except for the part where I made many friends. I felt more connected to people in HS.

c9hllm,"Financial Aid didn't get applied to bill, office closed until after due date?","Hey guys. I got a bill for $27k for the fall semester of 2019. I got a $26.4k in financial aid (in letter) so that reduces my bill payment to $600. However, my university didn't apply any financial aid  to the bill and their office is closed until way past the due date. If I end up missing the payment, I have to hand in another $400 after. I clearly can't pay $27k. Should I just pay the $600, assuming they will take it off the financial aid later?


UPDATE!! I’m so dumb. Kinda. Turns out that I didn’t ACCEPT the financial aid offer. If you are awarded financial aid, you can either accept or decline. I didn’t accept/decline, so it went off as pending and I didn’t get the financial aid. The “kinda” part is that I needed someone else to find the page for me (I hired a guy to do the financial aid stuff for me). I still can’t find it myself. I checked the email award letter, I checked the financial aid website that describes my exact grants and loans I’m getting and such, but the other guy found it for me. I assumed that the financial aid would be placed a little later after I received my bill because it takes some time for the guys in the financial aid office to finalize everything. Oops.
