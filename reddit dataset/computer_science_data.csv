12,h9w9wa,False,General,8,Productive Summer Plan,computerscience,"Hey guys,

My name is Danyal Imran and I am a computer scientist who's currently pursuing MBA. I have 3+ years of professional experience, and during my professional tenure, a lot of the people I knew were excited on how I approach and solve problems. I've received many awards for my performance, and was a also between an HR battle when I decided to switch my job (because React over Angular any day).

This pandemic has given me an amazing opportunity, and finally I have decided to start my own YouTube channel (Trust me, I am all for quality content that's going to help y'all in the long run). I am quiet dedicated because I love this field, so I expect you to see the following courses in the next 2 months:

**101 - Programming Fundamental**: This course will focus on problem solving and logic building using C programming language (Yes, C language, because it teaches you how to think, and this is the main problem that I see people facing. Many people don't realize that programming is actually solving problems rather than learning the latest hit programming language.. Trust me, programming languages are very similar and its not hard to learn them)

**102 - Object Oriented Programming**: This course will focus on the OOP paradigm on how to properly structure and code your problems. Here the complexity of the problem is going to be quiet big, and you can code actual real life problem but without a GUI (Maybe an intro to Swing for GUI if Java? idk that yet). The course will either use C++, C#, or Java (haven't decided that yet)

**103 - Data Structures**: So far you know how to think about a problem and solve it. Now you're going to think about how to handle data i.e. storage, read, write, sort, etc. You'll amazed to learn what a data structure can do to make a program fun faster. I will also dive into a language's built in data structure so that you know what a language provides and how you'll be saving your time.

**104 - Design & Analysis of Algorithms**: Finally, we reach at a course that talks about writing efficient code, yes efficient i.e. the best possible solution for a problem. If you are good with Algorithms, you can easily ace top 100 tech company coding interviews because this differentiates a good coder from a great coder.

These courses will include (and are not limited to): Theoretic & Practical Lectures, Assignments (Solved & Unsolved), Projects, Links to Coding Websites, Links to Exciting Articles, and many more

These courses are generally for people starting out their journey in Computer Science, or people who have problems in solving tasks (telling computers what and how to do it). Once you complete these 4 courses, you can then plan your career in any field (Mobile, Gaming, Web, etc.), because this is what it takes to be a programmer.

If you are interested, then stay tuned & subscribe to my YouTube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz\_JBGi-DhhV2nNJzK6kD7Q](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz_JBGi-DhhV2nNJzK6kD7Q)

The first course should be out 2 weeks from now.

If I am done with the aforementioned courses, the following courses are in my future plans:

105 - Databases (SQL & NoSQL)

201 - Web Development (Front-end: React, Back-end: Node)

301 - Artificial Intelligence

302 - Data Science

401 - Cloud Computing",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/h9w9wa/productive_summer_plan/,12,That's a lot of planning!

16,hresk4,False,General,1,csrankings.org is biased. We need a better research based ranking website for CS.,computerscience,"Many of you know the importance of university rankings while applying to a grad school, especially if you are an international student. I am an international student and I relied upon [csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org) to shortlist the universities based on the research. I always thought this website was well maintained and could be trusted. However, a recent incident has changed my opinion.

Being a beneficiary of the website, I was personally motivated to keep it upto date to help new international students applying to grad schools. I noticed there were many missing faculties in the AI field at McGill University and thought I would submit a pull request. To my surprise the pull request was denied by the repo owner citing that a particular faculty was not a full-time employed at the university (the policy was to exclude faculty who are <75% at the University). In this case, I personally know the faculty and I told the owner that the faculty was a full-time employee and is in a tenure track. I also told him that they supervise newly admitted students (MS and PhD). But then came a big surprise. The repo owner told me that the faculty is a head at an industrial lab and hence only way to verify if that person is >75% at the university is to check their financial records.

This reply made me upset because:

* The website essentially gets updated at the discretion of one person. He chooses to ignore a particular pull request (PR) citing some policy of the website. However, there are many other faculties on the website who are part-time researchers / head at some research labs (I can speak for many AI faculties in this case). There is no way to get their names removed because one can't produce the faculties' financial records to prove that they are correct.
* Many so called policies are not mentioned on the website but the owner brings them up while submitting a PR. In my opinion these policies should be put on the website so that the students who look at the website are not being misled.
* The owner doesn't accept ECE faculties who supervise students admitted to CS because they don't fit the policy. However FAQ page of the website mentions the following statement:

>As mentioned above, tenure-track faculty who can advise PhD students in CS can be included regardless of their home department. The primary audience of CSRankings is prospective graduate students who are seeking a postgraduate degree in Computer Science.

But when I asked him about this, the person mentioned that the faculty of ECE has to be listed on the CS website. However, in a later part of the conversation, he says 

>websites are generally lagging indicators at best

You can find the entire conversation during [here](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings/pull/2723#pullrequestreview-448465670). I find it hard to accept the fact that the website I trusted the most is actually faulty.

I hope there was a better research ranking website that is unbiased, give a good indicator of whether a faculty supervises a PhD or MS students (irrespective of the % spent at the university) and where the policies are applied to all the universities and faculties. In fact, the website should have a better policies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hresk4/csrankingsorg_is_biased_we_need_a_better_research/,0,Ranking things that vary along so many axes is a fundamentally flawed approach to begin with.

This achieves a good approximation of about 87%. My question is wouldn't it be more natural (and possibly better) to add a nuclear norm constraint or objective penalty (with some tunable parameter lambda) to this formulation to encourage the solution to be low rank and PSD while remaining tractable and convex?

This is vastly over simplified, but in there somewhere probably lies advanced techniques that could be used in certain circumstances to identify and thus combat the validity of deep fakes in a large media frenzy.

I am not sure how the low-level access would affect security, but I have heard from others that encrypting external drives caused them to fail and thus the protection offered was insufficient.  Internal drives can fail too of course, but this just makes the subject more opaque.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gxy65d/protecting_data_file_encryption_vs_drive/,1,"Yeah, not sure why encrypting an external is any different than just read write ops on it... 

I’m in the financial industry, we encrypt laptop drives and auto-comb networked storage drives for PII and move it to an encrypted file server. We also deal with encryption at the file level depending on what it is, on those same encrypted drives. Just slows down IO is all. Absolutely fine to encrypt an external, in fact you can buy purpose built encrypted externals and USB.

Do whatever the program does which constantly changes values in memory - like health for example in a game.

I was using cheat engine to help with my understanding of memory and the green addresses can be edited and actually stay there even when you reopen the program, it's always the same address.

Can you guys try to explain it in a ELI5 fashion?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/bur0vx/p_vs_np_and_np_hardness_and_np_completeness/,11,"P does not necessarily mean that you can find a solution quickly, it just means that the amount of time to solve the problem only grows at most a constant exponent of your input.  For given input n the solution will take O(n\^k) time as opposed to O(k\^n)

The P stands for Polynomial

The N in NP means non deterministic, it does not mean Not P.

Compare for a data set that goes from 2 to 100 items.  As n grows the NP solution time grows horrifically fast.

P     2\^5, 10\^5, 100\^5 vs

NP  2\^5, 2\^10, 2\^100

All problems that are P are NP in that P is a subset of NP.  Think P = Polynomial time, NP = non deterministic Polynomial time.  One of the aspects of NP problems is you can verify a solution in polynomial time.  If a problem has a polynomial time solution then verifying the solution can be done worst case polynomial time.

For example assume I have an algorithm that finds all the prime numbers from 1 .. n and it has a run time of O(n\^k).  If the number 534,343,534,343,534,343 is  in the range 1..n I can guarantee to test if it is prime within polynomial time.  Worst case I can just use the algorithm I used to find all the primes which I know is bound by O(n\^k).  This is why all P problems are a subset of NP problems.

Yeah, that's software engineering. That's the reason why so many companies lean into extensive testing.

You're right on track. I would tell interviewers ""This is my first job so I don't have a good metrics scale to measure my knowledge, but I haven't found a problem yet, that I couldn't solve with a bit of research. ""Using your resources"" is a golden phrase to use in interviews. 

Yes you are learning things. It took me a while to realize this, but every one knows a lot about a little. What I mean is, when you struggle with something, research it, find an answer and then apply it, you won't forget how you did it. Sure, you may forget language syntax or whatever, but you'll know how to solve the problem. When some one comes by and asks you for help on the same issue, you'll have advice to give right? That's you learning. The more times you struggle and Google stuff, the more you learn.

Software Engineering, programming, coding, whatever you want to call it, it isn't comprehensive. No one knows all of it. Let me give you an example. I'm the new guy on my team. Not only am I fresh out of college and need to learn how software is developed in the real world, I have to learn my company's products, design process, etc. I feel dumb literally everyday. Then last Tuesday there is this big ""Out of memory"" issue. Everyone scrambled and tried to figure out what server could sacrifice some memory to this process that was failing (data processing). I stepped up and told them that the heap memory wasn't full, rather the old generation ratio wasn't large enough. That if we adjust the NewRatio Java opts variable, the process should complete just fine. Seasoned engineers looked at me like I was a genius when my solution worked. Am I a genius? Hell no. I just so happened to write a research paper on Java garbage collection in my last semester of school. Out of the hundreds of things I don't know everyday, I did know this one thing.

When people say that getting into programming requires you to accept that you will spend the rest of your life learning, they aren't joking. If you aren't busy learning what's already out there, you'll be busy learning all the new technology that has yet to come out. ",2019-08-26 01:43:38

I have even been a general agency-wide recruiter in my career. Computer Science (especially today) could better be named Computing Science. It is the study of computing and computing systems (including artificial intelligence). It includes the architecture and internals of computers, Operating Systems, networks, and the Internet because that gives one extra insight into computing solutions that can be applied elsewhere. A person with a CS degree might have a job writing code to process and summarize data, then analyzing the results to find patterns that lead to further development of software and/or systems that solve some problem or implement some application. A CS person might write code that gets inserted into non-computer hardware that need to be controlled or managed (such as GPS devices, printers, cars, farm equipment, telecom switches, robotic devices, graphics cards in a PC, etc) which we collectively call embedded systems. A CS person might work for a gaming company to develop games, but that may require additional art, graphics, and gaming background. A CS person might be hired to work primarily with databases or information systems (such as with insurance companies). A CS person might work on various parts of a website (front end and/or backend). Ones first job may involve quality assessment, preparing/analyzing data, or making cosmetic changes to a website, but one can look for promotions or movement within to other jobs. If CS is a minor or 2nd major then doors of opportunity can open up in non-tech areas too—at least it may result in getting an interview that the person without any CS doesn’t get. You might be perceived as someone who would be good on the team because you are smart and you have technical expertise. Having CS in the mix might make you more attractive going into medicine, nursing, healthcare, business, pharmaceutical, law, criminal justice,  or social work. A recruiter might simply want to grant an interview to hear your story— seeing strong CS credentials and wondering why an interest in a different industry. Always remember that coding or programming often is people oriented because you are creating something to help or entertain people. It is not computer-centric. A person often invents a computer solution to do something that he/she is bored doing the existing slow, tedious, or uninteresting way. So your CS knowledge will even help you be more effective when making a spreadsheet for some club or non-profit organization you may volunteer with.

156,b5qglq,False,General,3,When and why do we use subnet mask?,computerscience,I was told subnet and masking is like using a mask in spray painting. But I guess that makes sense but when would you use it and why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/b5qglq/when_and_why_do_we_use_subnet_mask/,9,"As the name implies, it creates sub-networks. All of your computers might be on one big physical network but you can logically divide them into smaller sub-networks that can then be firewalled off or whatever makes sense for operational or security reasons. Put important data in a special protected subnet away from your office machines that browse the internet for example. Makes sure computers in one subnet can't talk to ones in another subnet. It keeps things separated.

A mask is what enables you to tell if a specific computer is on a specific subnet. Computers are identified on the network by IP address (ok technically a MAC address too but let's focus on the IP layer which is where subnetting comes in). Often you see an IP address written as something like 192.168.42.1. but that's the human friendly decimal representation: the ""real"" IP address is in binary, sequence of 1s and 0s. In IPv4 (still the dominant network protocol I think but IPv6 is growing) the IP address is 32 bits so that means 32 1s and 0s are used to give a computer a unique ""name"". Usually the 32 bits are split into 4 8-bit groups called ""octets"" that are when written in decimal. That's why you see 192.168.42.1, each number between dots represents 8 bits so all together is 32 bits.

So how do you make a subnet? Well it makes sense to group IP addresses together based on some of the 1s and 0s being in common. Sort of like having a family name, you and family members like share the same family name but have a different person name (John Doe, Jane Doe are both in the Doe family but have different first names to tell them apart on paper).

So your subnet is kind of like a family name, all the computers on that subnet share the same ""name"" which in the case of binary means they share the same sequence of 0s and 1s at the beginning of their name.

The mask is therefore the thing that tells you which of the 32 bits is the ""family"" name (subnet, like Doe) and which are the first name (computer name on network, like John). The way it does this is that you write out all 32 bits of the IP but you put a 1 in every spot where that bit is part of the family subnet name and a 0 where that bit is part of the computer name. 32 is a lot to type out so let's use an example of an 8 bit IP address. If the first 5 bits are the family subnet name, then the last 3 bits must be the computer name. So the subnet mask is 5 1s representing the subnet + 3 0s representing the computer name = 11111000. If you wrote the binary into decimal, you'd get 248 so you might see the subnet mask written as 248... To make it a little more human readable but really it's the bits that are important.

It's become a lot more common to use CIDR notation instead or writing masks. CIDR is just writing the number of bits that are used for the subnet name, so in our example above of an 8 bit IP address with a 5 bit subnet name, then you'd write the subnet mask in CIDR as just /5. Slash, with number of bits, and you're done.

You could have /8, or /16 or /24 or /27 or whatever you want as a subnet mask. What's the difference between them? Well the bigger the subnet number, the more bits are used for the subnet, which means you can lots more unique subnet names. But there's less bits for unique computer names so you can have less computers on that network. So you need to pick a good subnet mask that allows you to have enough networks to do what you need while allowing enough bits for computer names to accommodate the number of computers that need to be on that subnet. It can be tough to estimate that especially in a rapidly growing company so that takes some thought and experience to get right.

Hope that helps! ",2019-03-26 14:36:24

Those who made more mistakes tend to learn more. Plus, there's no people who never made mistake. Remember this.

If you stuck in your code, it's okay. Take a break, make a drink, have some meal or just sleep on it (there are chance you'll be getting the solution in your dream). Remember that your need sugar and short break after hours of thinking and coding.

If you asked way too many stupid questions, it's okay. Asking stupid question doesn't mean that you're stupid. It's just you don't ""see"" it yet. Just like when you use microscope to look at a sample, things are blur at first and you keep on adjusting until you can see the sample. It's just that. Ask, ask until you ""see"" the answer.

If you asked a question and within a few second you suddenly ""see"" the answer. Congratulations! We call this Eureka moments. If you posted it somewhere, just answer your own question. Someone out there probably having the same trouble to ""see"" like you. (been there, done that, in one of C subreddit) And oh, programmers talks to rubber duck and there's nothing weird about it. Really.

If you feel that you can't do this because you think that you are falling behind, you are not smart enough, you are a slow learner, etc.. Ask yourself and THINK, WHY you do this? WHY do you learn this on the first place? Do you LOVE this? WHY do you love this? ASK, THINK, ANSWER and HOLD ON to that answer. 

If you think that you need to stop this because somebody told you that you are not cut for this, ALWAYS ask that person WHY and HOW do you improve yourself. If the person know enough, you'll be getting a tips on how to develop yourself even further. If the person doesn't answer your question, he/she probably doesn't know enough. Remember this when you encounter people who's trying to bring you down, a great person who is also a great programmer is definitely an excellent problem solver, hence there's always good input coming from him/her.

I hope while you're walking this journey, you'll find your love in doing this. Coding, problem solving, whatever. This is going to be a part of your life, let this be something you love doing most.

In other words, stored ""bits of information"" on computer registers are best thought of as electric energy. Does that makes any sense?

Then I read a sentence from a related [Wikibooks article](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/CIE/Computer_systems,_communications_and_software/Components_of_a_computer_system_and_modes_of_use/Types_of_software) that threw me for a loop:

>*""Software components of a computer system have no physical presence, they are stored in digital form within computer memory.""*

What does that mean? Was I wrong in my initial assumption? Do electric charges themselves retain large chunks of information?

See, to me this is important because until the very recent past, I believed that being a programmer was more or less the same thing as being a computer scientist, insofar as what you need to know before pursuing a career in software development. For example, my understanding was that if you want to become involved in the development of video games, you *need* to know every last minutae of how computers work - how electric current is transferred via millions of transistors and logic gates, how these are represented on-screen, etc. You need to know the architecture of your game's graphics engine, you need to be 100% fluent in programming languages (i.e. never needing to look anything up - you know off by heart what to type, and *where* to type it), and so on and so forth.

In a digital computer, each electrical charge retains exactly 1 bit of information. More precisely, each location where a charge may or may not be, retains 1 bit. It takes many bits together to retain a ""large chunk of information.""

When the same computer runs two different programs (at different times), the hardware is ""exactly the same"".

187,8eeme9,False,General,12,Why can’t computers use analog signals (as opposed to I/O) to make values that are more than what’s capable with Binary?,computerscience,"Okay, I’m not a computer science major or professional, so forgive me if this is an obvious question, but why can’t we use analog type technologies in computer chips that would make them able to hold more values than I/O

What if computers could use different signals, and for simplicities sake we’ll use  voltage, to make even more values per digit. This would require something akin to a voltmeter to distinguish values so it’s probably size-wise not practical but it’s an easy example. It can be anything.

For example, the current Binary system converts ON and OFF signals to numeric values:

OFF = 0
ON (~5v) = 1

An hybrid Analog voltage based system:

OFF = 0
1v = 1
2v = 2
3v = 3
4v = 4
5v = 5
6v = 6
7v = 7
8v = 8
9v = 9

Again I know adding a voltmeter to a computer chip would make it large and cumbersome but this is just theoretical now. There are probably better ways, like wavelength, etc.

Analog signals can hold a range of signals. For example my headphones (analog) contain only two wires, thus two signals. But with only those two signals I can hear the entire range of notes. This wouldn’t be possible with only I/O signals.

And while sensors like that are probably mostly a matter of size, remember that some of the old computers like the Mark 1 were enormous.

My voltage may be a dumb example, but I just did it to keep things simple. Let’s take a chip that uses fibreoptics for example. The human eye is able to distinguish almost infinite different colors based on the lights wavelength:

https://imgur.com/gallery/ICe7MQK

Imagine a computer that used fiberoptics instead of I/O electricity. Light is significantly faster and can hold almost infinite values. Not just 1 and 0. Depending on the length of the light wave could be set to represent different values.

So back to my example of a 1-10 voltage based computer, we could make logic gates that could add these voltages together making an analog adder gate. So

1st digit: 1-10
2nd digit 11-100

5v+7v=5 in digit 1, 7in digit 2=75

In binary you need almost 7 bits to get up to the number 100. With an analog system you need just 2.

And Currently a digital 4 “bit” system can only hold numbers between 1-10, whereas a system like this could hold up to 10,000!

[2][2][2][2]
[8][4][2][1] (4 bits holds 1-10)

I'm a writer, and in the current scene I'm working on, a character receives a message containing a single digit: 1. It's meant to be a signal of sorts, kind of a red light/green light scenario so she knows the person who sent it is ready for something.

I'm trying to figure out how to best word this. Taking the on/off or yes/no logic into consideration, I started out by saying the message contained ""a single positive binary value."" I consulted with my sister—who's a software engineering major—and she suggested that ""positive"" might not be the best choice, but I definitely want to convey the idea that this message means ""yes"" or ""go"" or something. We came up with ""single affirmative binary value,"" but thought it sounded a little pretentious.

212,gz81p3,False,Discussion,7,Tracking Politician’s Records on Propositions of and Votes for Bills,computerscience,"(Posting for a friend)

Hello all,

 

We are a group of computer science students that can’t protest for different reasons (for instance, I live with someone who is immunocompromised and so can’t risk contracting coronavirus).

 

We have been donating to some organizations, signing petitions, and educating ourselves about systemic racism in the US. However, we want to use our expertise to do more.

 

Here, we present an idea and ask Reddit to help us determine if it’s useful and its potential flaws. We emphasize that we just want to help, so if you know of something we could do that could help more, please let us know.

 

 

**The Idea**

 

We want to find bills and acts that support ending police brutality (and perhaps divide these bills into different categories, such as the 10 categories defined [here](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/solutions#solutionsoverview) ) and display the voting records of house representatives and senators on those bills.

We could make this data open-source and provide visualizations for the data, allowing other websites to use it as they see fit.

 

Hopefully, this could better inform voters about what real action politicians have taken in support of the BLM movement.

 

We could do this in the following steps:

1.         Aggregate voting data for house representatives and senators in a JSON file and post publicly on Github

2.         Have humans look over bills and try to determine if they support one of the 10 causes given in the link above. (This would be subjective, so we would need to be careful; we know some legal experts willing to lend help, though). Create a list of bills and acts for each cause.

3.         Using the JSON data and the lists of bills and acts, create some visualizations or tables that make it easy to see which politicans voted for which bills and to what degree they support ending police brutality.

 

At the very least, an easy-to-use JSON file with voting histories of candidates would be useful (we think).

 

**Potential Issues**

 

Any data we obtain from Step 2 would have to be treated with extreme caution given: A) the subjectivity of determining whether or not a bill supports a cause and B) that voting for a bill which supports one issue does not imply that the voter cares about that issue (they may have voted for the bill because of another issue, and may feel indifferent about or oppose the issue in question)

 

 

**Questions for the Reader**

 

1.         Does something similar already exist (perhaps I missed it)?

2.         Does this seem helpful?

3.         Are there any improvements you suggest?

4.

224,gqi2c0,False,Discussion,13,"What are some things you love and hate about different programming languages, and what do you wish some programming languages would incorporate?",computerscience,"Hey guys, I have decided to take on the endeavor of creating a programming language and writing my own compiler (I would refer to this [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools#Second_edition) if you want to as well). I'm really just doing this as a personal project to improve my skills, and really just because I want to see if I can do it.

I would love to hear different opinions about what you think should or should not be incorporated in different programming languages. If someone leaves a comment saying that 'X' is awful, and no language should ever use it, but you think that 'X' is lovely and is quite useful, please, reply to their comment *respectfully* and give your opinion on the subject.

Here are a few things I think I would like to see incorporated in more languages (and maybe I will try to incorporate them in my own language):

* Unary '+' operator. Similar to the unary '-' operator, which just negates a number (like -2). But this operator would efficiently return the absolute value of negative numbers (but no regard to the efficiency of returning the absolute value of already positive numbers). 
* Range of numbers (such as 0..9 would be integers from 0 to 9). One possible application of this could be in switch statements (like case 0..9: for instance). See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-range-switch-case-cc/).
* Identity operator. Essentially the '===' in JavaScript, which compares the value as well as the type. See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Equality_operators).
* Varargs. Functions with a variable amount of arguments. Such as in Java. See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variable-arguments-varargs-in-java/).

Multiply that by 6 since we’re dealing with hexadecimal values (7 if you include the ‘#’ character), and now we have a string of almost 3,000,000 characters representing an image.

To be sure that your RSA can't be cracked in the next years (not forever) by supercomputers you should use at least 1024 bits per prime, but if you can, 2048 better.

If you want to design purposely a system than can be cracked nor in seconds but also not in hours, it is very hard to determine. Because of the nature of RSA cracking 1 more bit doubles the average time, meaning that de difference between 20 bits and 30 bits is 1000 times longer.
For example, if 10 bits takes a minute, 20 bits will take 16 hours so fine-tuning so that it takes the amount of time you want even if it is not that specific, it is still hard.

The time will depend a lot on how fast is you cpu, what environment you are using and if you are using multiple threads.
My guess is that you won't be able to do more than 20 bit RSA cracking with a normal computer in less than 30 minutes, but again it highly depends.

You should just try it out, but don't set the bits on the upper bound and star lowering them, rather set the number of bits to 10 and increase them until you are satisfied with the time that it takes. ",2020-05-06 17:41:03

I'm not extremely experienced with coordinating clubs and activities, but I'm really passionate about teaching and computer science. Just was looking for some guidance on format and content for the club. With my experience, I'm currently thinking:

- Introduction to creating websites with plain JavaScript, HTML, CSS (possibly getting into some frameworks?)
- Understanding how the internet works (from 1s and 0s to packets to webpages)
- Building clones of popular websites such as Instagram to demonstrate APIs, backends and databases
- Creating apps with Swift, React Native, etc.
- Introduction to machine learning (foundational things such as regression, gradient descent, what neural networks are, iterative learning) with concrete projects
- Scripting and web-scraping with Python to automate certain tasks
- Introducing how to use git, the command line, GitHub
- Presentations of people's side projects

I haven't done anything really with robotics or microcontrollers such as Arduinos but that's also something I'm looking at. There's definitely an audience for this type of club, since I have many friends who want a more practical perspective instead of their Java projects for school. But I'm also looking for some guidance on how to welcome newcomers as well.

I was thinking of maybe structuring these as lessons (with possibly rotating teachers?) and since everyone at my school has provided computers, they could follow along though some restrictions may apply. And since these lessons will take time to develop so I was thinking of maybe inspersing sessions with meetings where students can come in and ask for CS help, math help or anything science related. Any thoughts on other curricula or how I should approach these ""lessons"" or comments on format?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/fzq7ae/starting_a_computer_sciencestem_club_at_a_high/,1,I'd skip all the web stuff.

289,gbf666,False,Discussion,4,Is this equation completely useless for computing? (c^2-b^2- a^2):(b*a)=,computerscience,"Hi people,

Can this equation be used for computing (for fastening some things)? If you maybe see how, please feel free to tell? It has been tested for checking sums vs normal way and it performs slower than normal way. Maybe something different can be done with this equation. Do you see any other link? That is why I am here (I do not have computing science background). Feel free to share thoughts. What type of equations do you think can be done quicker with help of this equation (I got some at example #5 at the bottom - any good?)? If any?

This is the equation:  **(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=**

*This equation tells us:*

\-If  sum of any two numbers (and which ones) is 3rd number? If this type or  relationship is possible between 3 numbers (equation tells us how to  arrange numbers)?

\-if b=a\*2 and  c=b\*2 (or if there is any relationship between numbers by any other  multiplier)? If this type or relationship is possible between 3 numbers  (equation tells us how to arrange numbers)?

\- if it is possible to make triangle out of 3 numbers?

\_\_\_

Here it is. We have:

a,b,c

a,b,c are any possible positive numbers

We use this equation (we do not need to rearrange numbers):

**(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=**

If:

\_\_\_

\- result is **2**, than a+b=c and b+a=c

Proof:

If a+b=c; than c²=a²+2ab+b², so

Equation is: **(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=**

= (a²+2ab+b²-b²-a²):(b\*a)=2ab:(b\*a)=2

\_\_\_

\- result is **-2**,  than a+b (or b+a) is not c. But, if we take bigger number of a and b  and we swap it with c, than we will get correct result (for example:a is  bigger than b, than:a+b=c is not true; but c+b=a is true (and b+c=a  true also)).

Proof:

If a-b=c or(not and) b-a=c; than c²=a²-2ab+b², so

Equation is: **(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=**

= (a²-2ab+b²-b²-a²):(b\*a)=-2ab:(b\*a)=-2

\_\_\_\_

\- result is **between -2 and 2,** than numbers can form triangle.

\_\_\_\_

*Multiplier relationship (this can be done for every single multiplier, I only did it for 2\* multiplier)*

\- result is **5,5** or -**3,25** or **2,375**, than we got \*2 multipliers

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***Example #1:***

a=2

b=4

c=6

(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=2

(6²-4²-2²):(4\*2)=

=(36-16-4):8=

=16:8=

=2

Because our result is **2**, we know that 2+4=6.

\_\_\_

***Example #2***

a=2

b=5

c=3

(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=

(3²-5²-2²):(5\*2)=

=(9-25-4):10=

=(-20):10=

=-2

Because our result is **-2**,  we know that 2+5=3 is not correct. But if we take bigger number of a  and b and we swap it with c, than we will get correct result. In this  case we **swap** b and c (this means that equation:2+3=5 is correct).

\_\_\_

**Example #3**

a=30

b=40

c=20

(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=

=(20\^2-40\^2-30\^2):(b\*a)

=(-2100):1200=-1,75

Because our result is between **-2 and 2**, we know that 30,40,20 can form **triangle**.

\_\_\_

**Example #4**

a=2

b=4

c=8

=(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=

=(64-16-4):(8)=

=44:8=5,5

Because our result is between **5,5**, we know that we got **2x multipliers**.

\_\_\_

**Example #5 - Solving Simple Equation:**

**Simple Random** **Equation: -2+squareroot(x)=squareroot(x-4)**

a=-2

b=squareroot(x)

c=squareroot(x-4)

a+b=c

(c²-b²- a²):(b\*a)=2

(x-4-x-4):(-2\*squareroot(x))=2

(-8):(-2\*squareroot(x))=2

4:(squareroot(x))=2

4=2(squareroot(x))

2=(squareroot(x))

x=4

Thank you for reading. Have a lovely day. Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gbf666/is_this_equation_completely_useless_for_computing/,0,"First, I’d like to point out that it’s an expression, rather than an equation.  

For the first few things, it’s much easier, faster, and readable to write the original checks. Things like (a+b==c) are stupidly fast for a computer to do. Calculating squares and divisions, can be much slower, not to mention that your expression contains a lot more steps. Thus, your version was slower.

99.999% of the times, you don’t want to try to optimize these kind of basic math. That 0.001% are the times when 1) you are really good at low level programming, 2) you really need to squeeze that performance, and 3) there are constraints on the inputs that the compiler doesn’t know about, so it cannot generate the optimal code.

Your last example is weird, since you are still solving an equation, just a different one, and arguably a more complicated one. ",2020-05-01 09:45:41

319,fswvmk,False,Discussion,1,"Will it be possible to simulate a world and connect our consciousness to a computer,then interact with the world we simulate?",computerscience,"There have been a hypothesize that our world is just a simulation.You must have watched some movies that are based on this hypothesize.For example,the matrix.

And recently I watched a video at youtube.I find it inspiring.

>If you,and I,and everything around us is the result of computational information.It stands for reason that the information can be modified and manipulated to an endless extent.We would be nothing more than puppets in a theatre.Maybe the simulation begins seconds ago and we only think it’s been 13.9 billion years because the in formation is artificially included upon its creation.Maybe the universe is really very tiny and all distant celestial bodies are simplistic renditions to create the illusion of enormity,Maybe **nothing physically exists until we observe its existence**.Perhaps **detail and complexity is added when it’s needed instead of being constant and absolute**.(Source:Youtube)

So I have been thinking if it is possible for us to simulate a world on our own.(Yeah,that is right,I have been thinking about creating our own simulation.)

I reckon there are some problems.And I think that is why It sounds too science fiction.Here are some of the problems:

1.We don’t know how to connect our consciousness to the computer and interact with a program yet.

2.It is difficult to simulate a whole a world.Because the amount of computation is too large.

3.We don’t know the exact physics law of our world yet,which makes it impossible for us to program.

Well,I reckon there are ways to solve all these problems:

1.As I mentioned above.”Maybe nothing physically exists until we observe its existence.Perhaps detail and complexity is added when it’s needed instead of being constant and absolute.”That means that it is not necessary for us to simulate the whole world!We just simulate what the guy connected to the computer sees.And we definitely don’t need to simulate from of atoms and moleculars.The purpose of this simulation is just make the one connected to the computer program believe he or she is in a real world instead of just a simulation!By means of using particular arithmetic,it is possible for us to make the simulationsimulation seems as if it is real!(At least the one who is connected to the program assumes so!)

2.With the development of our technology,I believe it is possible for us to develop such technology in the future to connect our consciousness to the computer.As far as I am concerned,there have been companies working at it.(Elon Musk?)

3.Being in that simulation means that we need to interact with not only objects in the simulation but also people.I think it is a bit of difficult to simulate people.Maybe in the future AI will be able to simulate people of different characters randomly.And when we interact with them we may be able to see no difference between them and a real person.

Well actually I don’t know much about computer science.I major in physics.I wanna know your opinions.

If you think it is possible,then can you tell me when it is likely to become true?(I hope I would see it happen before I die.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/fswvmk/will_it_be_possible_to_simulate_a_world_and/,0,"“Scientists...

When right shifting it you will get 011 (3 in base 10).
Right shifting 6 (110) will give you the same. 

That's because the least significant bit (the first one on the right) is 1 when the number is odd, 0 when even. Right shifting removes this number so an odd number N and the even number N-1 will give the same result when right shifting. ",2020-01-21 13:54:15

I'm a CS student and I've read recently Mark Weiser's paper. He talks mainly about ubiquitous computing. I loved the paper btw.

I want to discuss some concepts that he talks about. I know that it's a paper from 1997 but still, it's a good one. 

Please, read the paper here:

[https://www.ics.uci.edu/\~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf)

It's really worth, and it's just 8 pages long. 

Now you've read it. Let's talk :)

So, IoT is the ubiquitous computing that he was talking about, right? At first, I thought of cellphones, but those still have 'a demanding focus of attention', the screen. But IoT, those are devices that we do not *see,* I see a coffee machine not a computer, I see a better fridge, a better clock, a better oven. Not computers. Those *disappeared*.

He talked about pads or tabs. We can say that these are today's smartphones and tablets, right? And the boards, we may think of them as today's smart TVs, but a big screen is just not that popular. But today smartphones, smart TVs and tablets are still not a form of ubiquitous computing so... quite similar but not exactly what he thought.

I think that the network that Mark describes here is already invented:

>Present technologies would require a mobile device to have three different network connections: tiny range wireless, long range wireless, and very high speed wired. A single kind of network connection that can somehow serve all three functions has yet to be invented.

4G. 5G. If I misunderstood let me know. 

Here's the final paragraph of the paper: 

>There is more information available at our fingertips during a walk in the woods than in any computer system, yet people find a walk among trees relaxing and computers frustrating. Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.

I think that this is yet to happen. And that will always be like that because technologies evolve so fast that the majority of society just can't catch up. 

Maybe ubiquitous computing is not even possible. It's just a utopic concept. And trying to get to that utopic place where computers vanished into the background will make great things happen, even if we never get there. 

Or maybe ubiquitous computing isn't good at all. What do you think?

I'm amazed by how he talks about things that we see today, before those things ever existed! 

Any insight from the paper, please comment :)

He says to me, “CS is a very difficult major. I don’t know many females who make it through all four years.”

I was dumbfounded. I did not say another word, but I wish I would have. How could you say that to an aspiring student? I would love to have another chance to chew this guy out.

For some more context, this guy graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. I don’t know how he has any room to talk about the difficulty of CS.

However, there are other details that changed as well specially on the differences on how Python 2 and Python 3 interprets a particular statement and you have to go and review the whole code where it went wrong.

I find C# on the other hand easier to migrate on code level because of it being a compiled language. Not much is going to change on the syntax. However if there are deprecated codes, it is easy to find because the compiler will find them for you and it saves a lot of time. ",2019-11-14 19:12:08

Some key tech we currently have that I think will make drones more deadly and advanced. 

-Machine learning AI that can fly autonomously without collision, or learn through flight simulators. (skydio drones)

-GPS systems to create a realtime map of the drone’s location at all times, set patrol areas for the drone to comb. 

-Facial recognition to remember every person it has ever seen and their last known location over gps. 

-High definition IR cameras to record previous flights, spot targets miles away, seek or pursue targets based on clothing, color, appearance

-Fast computer CPU to create a realtime 3 dimensional map of the world around it as it flies

Another big sign to me is how video games have advanced. With the right software, a drone might view the world as one big sandbox game, essentially behaving as an NPC tuned our liking.

I'm currently working on producing a short film written by Andy Wir (Author of the Marsian) the story involves an AI and we are struggeling how to viusalize the AI.

The AI communicates with a human through text messages and later through voice.

So my question to all you AI users/researchers is:  
How do you visualize an AI in your head? How does an AI look to you? A simple commandline with lot's of commands/logs/outputs running through? A fancy graphic like the speaking animation of many smart assistance?

I have a Lenovo Z50 on which I have two Operating systems Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16. The problem, which I believe everyone has, is when you shutdown Windows and after that you boot on Ubuntu you will not be able to write on the other disks, if you search for this you find that windows has an option of "" fast reboot"" and it is activated by default this option allows windows 10 to reboot faster and causes the stated problem. If you deactivate this option or if you shutdown using a full shutdown using cmd ( shutdown /f) you will not have the problem and another way is simply to restart from Windows ( restart it normally) then select Ubuntu, you will be able to write in the other disks.
If anyone has a low-level explication on how does this happens I would be grateful. 
Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/dgcb1q/managing_disks_by_two_operating_systems/,1,"When you do a hybrid shutdown (""fast boot""), Windows 10 closes your running applications, logs you out and then hibernates (writes relevant parts of RAM to disk). This way it doesn't have to load the kernel, drivers and then start various services on the next boot, as that would involve extra work and checks .

When you boot, it can just copy the contents of the hibernation image right back to RAM, and most drivers and services will barely notice that there was a shutdown. This has a drawback however, as almost everything has to be the same as it was, including the state of the disk. When you are running Windows and a file is open for writing by a driver/service, there is no way in hell that a user (or even administrator) could touch that file. Or just system files in general. But while you're on Linux, you can freely poke in them as Windows isn't there to enforce its rules. Allowing you to mess with the contents of the NTFS drive like that would allow you to ruin a consistency and continuity everything is relying on, easily leading to blue screens of death when a driver or service finds something unexpected. Since it is basic software engineering policy not to trust the user, they simply don't allow you to fuck up.

Is the developer shortage really that bad?

If kids or even a significant minority of them are required to program in the future (more so than usual) then the developers of today and tomorrow have monumentally failed society.

Now anyone interested can do it at home and do it in freaking Python.

Also, how many kids are genuinely going to be interested in the subject? The Maths and Science kids and nobody else. How many kids go on to further their study in STEM fields? The obsession with getting every kid into STEM needs to end, there's more to life. 

Sure, it'd be great to teach kids about some of the problem solving techniques that CS has to offer but I'd rather much have them focus on getting the statistics, calculus and linear algebra right first (something that isn't taught properly in most schools).

First and foremost I am not asking anyone to write or construct the essay for me.

I'm a first year comp sci student and part of my first assignment is to write an essay on how 'free software does not benefit freedom of expression'. Seeing as though I live in Australia I thought it wise to define 'freedom of expression' as our law does.

'Freedom of opinion and expression is the right to hold opinions without interference, and cannot be subject to any exception or restriction.'

It goes on to talk about the mediums it applies to, which is basically any medium, and how there are actually limitations of the right, for example intentionally inciting violence, and some 'artistic' material.

I can think of few reasons as to why free software (libre not gratis) could be a negative but all of them come from a business perspective, and have nothing to do with freedom of expression. Are there any more educated fellows here who can perhaps give their insights on the topic?

485,d4zuy1,False,Article,7,How to create General ai,computerscience,"There is alot to talk about especialy about programming i tried to make it as simple as possible by avoiding it,this is easiest solution i know.I could write a book about it but dont have much time left so I would never finish it.U can read more on twitter jure cvitanovic on facebook these are blog posts.

Reasoning

Reasoning is tricky cause ai doesnt know shit for sure if it doesnt have input and calculations without input are cruical for decision making,especialy priority.U have to draw radiuses min max if u want precision on translation(movement)pathfinding with weights is good but u need to divide and conquer cause u cant run pathfinding on large area and u have to run it a lot of times regulary especialy on new input or output.Interest can help determine probability cloud in an area but u have to account for new events and baits.Bait can be predicted when something is out of interest of living beings double bait when time for objective on ""better solution"" is to good for robot and bad for humans(based on location for example).Distraction bait when u calculate what opponent doesnt want u to do and bait takes ""realistic time"" or longer and times differentiate between cloud of probability for thing they dont want robot to do and bait.

Its important to establish interest and how it manifests itself.For example if u avoid killing people u avoid translating things into their body or excessive input on their bodies in different ways.

Excessive input can be calculated as things done by people(or other beings) that hurt (input of unusual movement for example)them but dont happen inside simulation.

Past is important factor here cause even if thing is translated near(projectile) past can determine intention.

Interest can be simple like love,survival ( like sub can be need to belong ,power ,money ,health)

Love can also be part of survival but design of spreeding genes doesnt help u survive but your kids.So its important factor even if it increases health.Health can be linked to increased perfomance for calculations.

i could list alot of situations but the point is that u have to generalize a bit then based on micro actions u feine things u dont understand.Scientific thinking which takes separate thread or processor deals with thing not logical by simulations where u have to question certain things and define new one with as little attributes as u can cause ure just have a bloating mess.

For no input red data on electronic devices about certain things like people u go with geographic data based on accumulation of things of interest or u can skip and avoid it in calculations if u dont have any.

if u include it in calculations u screw up the systemcause u get to many error in decision making (this might be less obvious).

Priorities are very important in reasoning cause they can decide success or failure.U generaly want to avoid more risky decisions but its unaviodable cause ai doesnt know everything.U need to caclulate things on a fly for redecisions (adjustments),giving up on a desicion(part of an objective single or many depends how u program it)is generaly bad idea unless the effect is negative (bait).U usualy want to adjust and avoid switching to alternatives especialy to late cause u have different stats(location effects on body etc) and things generaly need to be precalculated which could falls into adjustment category.Time is an factor but bigger factor is conflict of interest,effect of threat can be actualy calculated without any data on it based on ""logic"" of simulation.

Data from that can be established and fed into database.For example experiencing an explosion,purpose of actions(translating circular object when interest is harm at low speed could potentially be harmles unless there is uncertainty of possible chemical reaction and act on ""doing"" something with the object to avoid self harm or object being activated based on movement time or enviroment attributes)can help u determine the goal of decision or simply decision of other living being or effect of an simulation(robot running from lava cause of heat as a thread aswell reduced visibility large amount of mass and etc-u run simulation of impact on a fly to determine effect).

Priorities are such as time,distance(difficulty lots of conflict),other beings in area and enviroment simulations all can be generalized into other and expanded by calculations if u do them with uncertanty based on very primitive rules and not expand those more when calculating,depends how u want to do it. 

Ai input

Its separated by physics simulation and prediction of living beings since they dont obide laws.

Living things have more iregular shape,structure of bones is relevant to be calculated and can be determined by shading of skin or if with clothes by running cloth simulation,calculating shape of body then determining where bone lie based on ""uplifting"".For all that u need to determine the shape of body ull gonna calculate.Double camera (like eyes) help alot in that prediction otherwise u have to rely more on movement.Beings tend to have rigged surface noisy texture prolongated(depends on a being) based on shape of a being.Math for simulation is already there it will be wrong to a degree cause of hardware so u ll gonna have mistakes but with time those mistakes show so if u recalculate

the decision making of output shouldnt be to bad if u think mistakes would ""grow"".Structure of being also has to be determined cause some dont rely on bones but have shell or bone less structure.

Visual input is probably the hardest.

Other input may be sound,transfer of data via electromechanical waves(option of hacking or sniffing)

thermal data(bad at distance but can help in close encounters) .

This would belong to reasoning but it s worth saying that all data not made logical by simulations is produced or is human.Things produced by humans tend to have purpose linked to interests,strange textures that dont make sense when time is a factor(cause maintenence-sign of human activity nearby in time scale) .Things made by human are not alive cause they still run by simulation just illogical to exist ""normaly"".

Other input could be vibrations like explosion but its kinda nonsense cause u can blow input device and still confirm such event via visual sound or thermal.

Dust(smoke) as a problem in determining beings can be removed on delta time with simulation.

Things on camera such as dust become obvious very quickly since they stay relativly same position during movement and distance calculations are ""wrong"" for it.

Misconceptions about agi.

Robots dont know things for sure there is probability of mistake when predicting living beings

and what they do if u dont have input.There is lack of precision in simulations cause of hardware

but u can tune that how u like to a degree.

robots dont have to be ruthless it all dpends who writes politics for action which are there to limit

stuff like skynet happening ,or something u dont want which is spoken alot in safety of ai.

robots need to be a generalist and to reduce having to many of them which would increase cost and

all have their vulnerabilities they need to have a shape of a human or to some degree depends

what is their basis of movement what materials they are made of and etc.

robots can be destroyed by high powered weapons explosives missiles since they cant act perfectly since they dont know everything and estimation has to be decided they can fall into traps or destroyed at distance by humans they are not invincible.

if they have to act fast the have to rely on fast decision making which i called instinct which can be wrong.so if u make one thats the tricky part.u have to decide stuff like priorities and radiuses of actions and interest.

robots dont evolve 20000 years in a week they ""prefer"" to do things cause thinking takes time and has high probability of ending nowhere to its more effective to just act.

robots can build other robots either from scratch or by having blueprints and copying code.

so being an ai engineer doenst make u special or a god.

u cant build robots solely with machine learning even if program can learn anything cause then it cant understand things ,u cant run infinite simulations on life especialy since its changing and same situation may never occur again.Even if u generalize some things its still far to little weights to be effective,if u generalize to much then u have useless shit.

If u want to prove me wrong be polite and ill discuss and explain

490,c9s1pk,False,Article,4,Adding and Subtracting with logic designs in response to u/Sharpeye1994's post,computerscience,"First a disclaimer: I'm making this after I posted some comments as feedback to [u/Sharpeye1994](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sharpeye1994)'s post to which I was called out as not making sense or just generally greeted with some degree of toxicity. So I've decided I'd make this post in an attempt to better illustrate the points I raised. I in no way mean this in a hostile manor but am upset that instead of responses being along the lines of ""Can you explain what you mean?"" they were ""This makes no sense, not one bit, absolute garbage"". So, without further hesitation, I hope this is useful!

So starting of with the smaller items we can start out using half adders and build up from there, as I'm sure you're all aware the logical diagram of the half adder is as follows:

[Half Adder Logical Design](https://preview.redd.it/jtxk5240kn831.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d59d5a17724840c65070bdb9027d3c7166e272)

The truth table is as follows:

|A|B|Sum|Carry|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|0|
|1|0|1|0|
|0|1|1|0|
|1|1|0|1|

&#x200B;

Now, we can create our next component by building on top of our existing design for the half adders. We're going to create a full adder. Our design that's in place is:

[Full Adder Logical Design](https://preview.redd.it/9mxhup2oln831.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=6be9355af66a2cc611c30ca2babc7cdee1a4930c)

Now again, if we draw the truth table:

|A|B|Carry In|Sum|Carry Out|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|1|0|0|1|0|
|0|1|0|1|0|
|1|1|0|0|1|
|0|0|1|1|0|
|1|0|1|0|1|
|0|1|1|0|1|
|1|1|1|1|1|

This truth table is a little bit bigger but what I want to draw your attention to is the sum of A, B and the carry input. They're encoded into the 2 bit binary at the output. i.e. the last row, 1+1+1 = 3, or in binary 11. Which is what we can see between the sum and carry outputs.

However, we're currently only supporting addition with this full adder so we want to be capable of subtracting numbers with this system too. So in order to do this we can use a system called 2's complement, this however means that we're in a signed space. For this project I'll be using an 8-bit signed space.

2s complement works by inverting all of the bits and then adding 2. So if we have 3 (00000011) and we want -3 we invert all the bits (11111100) and add 1 (11111101) which is the binary that will denote -3 in our signed space. Another note to take is because we're using a signed space we can't take into account an extra bit within our output. i.e. if we were working strictly with addition and not an 8-bit signed space then 11111111+11111111 could be outputted as 111111110 with a 9 bit number. However this doesn't make sense with our signed space as in 2s completement 11111111 is -1 therefore -1+-1 = -2 which is true if we ignore the overflow bit we've introduced. i.e. 11111110 instead of 111111110. My point is it doesn't make sense to include the overflow bit in your calculations if you're using 2s complementary numbers.

Now, let's incorporate this into our full adder. We essentially want to introduce a condition that will allow us to differentiate between addition and subtraction of numbers. When this condition is true we want to invert one of the inputs.

&#x200B;

|Condition|Output|
|:-|:-|
|False|A+B|
|True|A-B|

So we can upgrade our Full adder to be the following:

&#x200B;

[Full Adder\/Subtractor](https://preview.redd.it/t1db8cugon831.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=85b2091432dcca702c40fbf47be93509ae26804f)

The XOR gate on the input of B handles inverting the value of the bit when our condition is true. If look at the truth table of this operation:

&#x200B;

|B|Condition|B ⊕ Condition|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|
|1|0|1|
|0|1|1|
|1|1|0|

Now what you can see is when the condition is true the value of the XOR operation is opposite of whatever B is. So this will invert our value of B when trying to do subtraction, and when the condition is false it'll have no influence on the value meaning standard addition will be carried out.

Now we can build a full 8 bit chain of our full adder/subtractor circuits.

&#x200B;

[8 bit adder\/subtractor](https://preview.redd.it/havl5hxkqn831.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb8098302cca0151cf9eba26971c7d4c18beec2e)

So, everything is setup now and notice how the condition is fed into the carry input at the top, this is what introduces the +1 that's required for our 2s complement. Now the schematic is done and we can demonstrate some values with it.

&#x200B;

[1+1=2](https://preview.redd.it/gmh48ro0rn831.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=c44032b8efd273dad0d1c1d70891475874627228)

EDIT: Just realised I never offered an explanation on how to calculate the value of a negative. The most significant bit is a negative of its value, so in our case of 8 bit our most significant bit has a value of -128 and then you just work out the value as if it's normal binary whilst taking into account the negative. i.e. 10000001 is -128 + 1 or -127.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/c9s1pk/adding_and_subtracting_with_logic_designs_in/,19,"Yes very helpful.

Quantum computing is an extremely interesting and popular topic. Even though it is still in its infancy, it promises to change the computing landscape and even usher another stage to our civilizational development. This is all due to an exponential increase in computing power that it will inevitably bring. It will make all of the tasks that previously took months and years to complete easily solvable within days, hours and even minutes. The wide spectrum of its potential applications ranges from medicine to finance. It will solve tasks that were previously unachievable and revolutionize every sphere where it is applied. The potential changes that it will bring being groundbreaking, to say the least. Recent achievements in quantum computing and their practical applications will be described in the paragraphs below.

First of all, it is important to understand the fundamentals of quantum computing in order to see how it differentiates from classical computing and how is it capable of exceeding it. Its basis lies in a completely new approach to computing and to matter itself. It draws on the principals of quantum physics and operates on a completely new worldview of the universe. The quantum bits, unlike classical bits that are either 1 or 0, combine both in themselves. Allowing them to simultaneously exist in multiple states at once. This allows for multiple computations to happen simultaneously and is generally known as superposition. The best example to illustrate it would be the widely-known Schrodinger’s cat, which is in two states at once.

&#x200B;

Currently, data governance teams attempt to apply manual control at various points to control the consistency and quality of the data. The introduction of Data Version Control (DVC) version tracking would allow data governance and engineering teams to engineer the data together, filing bugs against data versions, applying quality control checks to the data compilers, etc.

Platforms like [Palantir Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) already treat the management of data in much the same way as versioning of code. Within data versioning platforms datasets can be versioned, branched, acted upon by versioned code to create new data sets. This enables data driven testing, where the data itself is tested in much the same way as that the code that modifies it.

Abstract

General-purpose computers have become ubiquitous and important for everyday life, but they are difficult for people with paralysis to use. Specialized software and personalized input devices can improve access, but often provide only limited functionality. In this study, three research participants with tetraplegia who had multielectrode arrays implanted in motor cortex as part of the BrainGate2 clinical trial used an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) to control an unmodified commercial tablet computer. Neural activity was decoded in real time as a point-and-click wireless Bluetooth mouse, allowing participants to use common and recreational applications (web browsing, email, chatting, playing music on a piano application, sending text messages, etc.). Two of the participants also used the iBCI to “chat” with each other in real time. This study demonstrates, for the first time, high-performance iBCI control of an unmodified, commercially available, general-purpose mobile computing device by people with tetraplegia.

The success of a film is usually measured through its box-office revenue or through the opinion of professional critics; such measures, however, may be influenced by external factors, such as advertisement or trends, and are not able to capture the impact of a film over time. Thanks to the recent availability of data on references among movies, some researchers have started to use citations patterns as an alternative method for ranking movies. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking method for films based on the network of references among movies, calculated by combining four well known centrality indexes: in-degree, closeness, harmonic and PageRank. Our objective is to measure the success of a movie by accounting how much it has influenced other movies produced after its release, from both the artistic and the economic point of view. We apply our method on a subset of the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) citation network consisting of around 47,000 international movies, and we derive a list of films that can be considered milestones in the history of cinema. For each movie we also collect data on its year of release, genres and countries of production, to analyze trends and patterns in the film industry according to such features. We also collect data on 20,000 directors and almost 400,000 performers (actors and actresses), and we use the network of references and our score of movies for evaluating their career, and for ranking them. Since the IMDb dataset we employ is highly biased toward European and North American movies and personalities, our findings can be considered relevant principally for Western culture.

It requires an investment in DevOps skills, practices and supporting technology to move analytics out of the lab and into the business.

DVC is an open source tool for data science projects. It makes your data science projects reproducible by automatically building data dependency graph (DAG). Your code and the dependencies shared by Git, and data  —  through cloud storage (AWS S3, GCP) in a single DVC environment. It clearly helps to manage a big fraction of DevOps issues in daily data scientist routines:

1. Pull all kinds of necessary data from a variety of sources.

2. Extract, transform, and load the data.

3. Facilitate continuous machine learning and decision-making.

4. Share your algorithms and data.

Another DVC feature is ability to support multiple technology stacks. Whether you prefer R or Python-based implementations for industrial data products, DVC will be able to support the pipeline properly.

Surely the exact opposite is true?  As something becomes more disordered, 
the number of bits of information needed to describe it increases – “information grows”. 

To find structure we need to throw away information. A common simple example is 
summarising a large number of observations in a sample with a single number, by 
calculating the sample mean. The reason we calculate the sample mean is 
fundamentally that the entropy of the mean is lower than the total entropy of the 
original set of  observations.  Throwing away information (aka entropy) is what living 
things need to do both to preserve their own biological structure and also as part of 
trying to discern structure in their overly information-rich environment.

Its true that there is something that is hard to grow and preserve against the tendency 
to increasing disorder, but wouldn't it be better to find a different name for it

So for instance, if our range is (0, 10) and is given a value of 7 it should return 7. However, if it is given a value of 11 it should return 9, a value of 12 should also return 8. Also, if a value of -2 is given it should return 2, and so on.

I’ve got it working, for the most part, but it’s just a rough draft and is pretty dirty. I can’t pastebin right now as I don’t have a hotspot at the moment so here is a picture.

https://imgur.com/a/2IMAWD3

I’ve got it working for ranges that are on the positive side of the number line but the negative side does not work. I’ve been working on ways of mirroring the number line on the origin with either 0 or the max value being the origin. Or even doing my calculations with absolute values. It’s been quite a pain.

The part that doesn’t work too well is when a range covers both sides of the number line. For instance, (-2, 10). This should be able to work and I’ve gotten pretty close but the code fails in other areas once implemented so I had to remove it.

On the top of the code you’ll see a variable called “side”, this determines what side of the number line the range is on. -1 is left (negative), 0 is mixed (both), and 1 is right (positive). Here is a chart of what it returns.

(-2, 0) = -1  
(-8, -2) = -1  
(2, 5) = 1  
(0, 20) = 1  
(-2, 5) = 0  

Any help would be greatly appreciated. This should be the stable and end result of (0, 10) when given a value of 19.

I know I can get this working but it will involve some integer wrapping I’ve implemented in a separate function and I’ll have to offset and invert the value depending on the side of the number line the range is on. I don’t want to go to that extreme because I need this to be as performant as I can get it. I’ve been trying to implement this for 3 days now and am pulling hairs. Thank you.

But I can already tell you that distributed is mainly used by the majority of big compagnie (Oracle, Google ect) because it is definitely more efficient and it scales a lot better with huge data.

There are multiple reasons distributed is the viable solution:
- you can distribute the data around strategic location, so if the main server is in USA but one of the yt video is viral in France, it would be a lot better to keep it on a European server.
- having everything on one server forces is not viable when you have million of user, the network on the server side will quickly become a bottleneck. Having multiples server allows to split the connections on different location and not surcharge a the server bandwidth.
- if the task is heavy and can be parallelized you can multiply the processing speed by the number of servers you have (kind of). This can work for huge database, example if you search for all people named ""Bob"". Server 1 could search for Bob on the first half of the data and server 2 on the second half.

This is over simplified and in practice distributed servers is way more complicated and behave way differently for every application, but I hope I was clear enough and that I didn't say anything wrong. ",2020-06-06 09:03:13

So if anyone has any ideas on free online classes or courses i can take, it would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gzrpbr/free_online_computer_science_courses/,3,Harvard's CS50 is by far one of the best online courses I've come across.

I'd totally recommend it over any others (I've done dozens of online courses throughout the years and completed a good handful) and can tell you that this is the ONE to do. ,2020-06-09 17:28:21

I’m all honesty I wouldn’t consider my math to be full on calculus since it’s pre calculus and is simply preparing me for the real thing. I’ve never struggled so hard at a subject in my life. When I look at it, it’s like a completely different language; I understand with time that it’ll get better but does anyone have any words on how impactful math was to their education or computer science career. I guess I need a little inspiration and actual input to those who have made it. Also if anybody has any advice on how I could learn pre calculus and calculus on a college level by my self since the teaching style my professor has doesn’t match with my learning style, that’ll also be appreciated.

Thanks for the advice and time.

Thanks a lot",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hewqnk/required_coresyear/,0,">I ran a job using 10 cores a d it took 160 min.

That means if you only have 1 core it takes 1600 minutes, if you have 100 it's 16 minutes.

>I processed 100 samples using 1 core -> 1600 minutes from above this means that processing 1 sample n 1 core takes 16 minutes

Formally:

    samples
    ------- = time
     cores

If you have more cores and same samples, it takes less time.

If you have more samples and same cores it takes more time.

If you want to speed up you either need to increase the core cunt or decrease the samples.

&#x200B;

>How many cores/year does it equal to? This question does not make much sense

I am not sure how to understand this question. Do you mean: how many cores do you need if you want to process 100 samples in exactly one year?

&#x200B;

>If i want to do 40000 samples in the same amount of time( just for the sake of the example) do I just multiply the cores week computed in (1) by 400 to get the required cores/year?

I assume the same amount of time refers to the 160 minutes you mentioned before in this case  cores / year does not make any sense at all.

No offence (I'm sure I'll get downvoted anyway) but if this type of question is troublesome for you then Computer Science might not be the right science for you. CS is full of relationships between some variables / data (that's basically all what programming is about) and this example is a very easy relationship between variables. ",2020-06-24 07:39:39

You should start with some HTML, do the basic layout, page structure, all that good stuff.

I am a mechanical engineer just getting started with my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering with my research focusing on computational mechanics and physics (Mechanics) simulation.

However, in my Ph.D. I am expected to simulate entire problems with solution algorithms. Most of the time, I hit a wall when I am expected to code it even though I understand the physics behind it as most of these papers come without the code.  As a result of which I either have to ask-around or spend much more time than I should on the problem resulting in wasting time and even missing deadlines.

What you need is a good book on numerical methods. There are books are written specifically for engineers.

You can find a lot on scribd.com, I’d suggest a subscription for a few months to get what you need as you start brainstorming for your research. 

Python is a solid language for implementation. Most things can be done very easily with numpy arrays, there are a lot of built-in functions in scipy as well. I’ve implemented a 2D finite difference explicit heat flow simulation just using array slicing in less than 100 lines of code. Practically useless, but the REPL of Python is very useful for debugging these types of things. And if you need more speed, you can get C or FORTRAN like performance using numba. Avoid Matlab, it’s really a hole you can go deep into but sees very little use professionally, and I’ve spoken with multiple PhD engineers who wish they had used Python or C++ instead.

652,gjth61,False,Help,8,"[question] can I write an ""exe"" program to run on all x86 64 bit platform, regardless of OS.",computerscience,"I am an armature scriptor, as work or life requires, I will do vba and python stuff. I have a confused mess of **imprecise** computer knowledge. So I have to burden you to interpret what I will say below.

**What I know, or I think I understand:**

* If you call for OS's service to read a file from disk or print a text on the screen then your program will be OS dependent. Programming languages really make those tasks deceptively simple.
* If you are writing in a compiled programming languages (like C, C++) you have limited the compiled exe to the compiler's OS already.

**What I am not entirely sure, and what I am asking:**

when I use a compiled language, the compiler will turn my code into binary assemblies. Those binary assemblies should be just CPU instructions. As long as my code doesn't use any API or ABI that invoke OS routines, my binary file should just run on all x86 CPUs? I imagine binary assemblies are just whole bunch of ""load register A from memory location B, and add to register C"", they are not OS specific.

Unless there is some mandatory boiler plate code specific to OS, added by the compiler, that requests CPU's core/threads and memory allocation from the OS.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gjth61/question_can_i_write_an_exe_program_to_run_on_all/,1,"Yes and no. No, in that a lack of 'import os' does not mean that you aren't using the os. Even starting a process (like the one your code runs in) is an operating system function. Storage is managed by the operating system. Memory management in modern systems is done by the operating system.

Even the compiled formats themselves differ - ELF on Linux, PE/COFF on Windows, Mach-O on MacOS, and a host of other formats that are either historical or simply used by uncommon platforms.

The typical approach to all this is to build for each platform the scaffolding required to run programs. This means you'll generate a Windows build, a Linux build, a MacOS build, and builds for any other platforms you want to target.

For interpreted (or interpretable) languages like Python, that will also mean that you can create operating system-specific builds of the interpreter. 'apt install python3' will install a different binary from 'brew install python', or from 'choco install python'. This does, however, mean that the different python runtimes can execute the same python scripts.

Another approach would be to throw out the operating system altogether. There are two approaches to this - the first is to bundle your application with a stripped-down operating system. There are a number of projects out there to help you build these, but you do need to put in more thought than just choosing a target platform. You can read up on Unikernels to follow this path deeper. Note that supporting actual hardware with this approach can be painful.

The second approach is even more minimal - to write your application to directly drive the hardware. That is, your application doesn't just add AX to BX (though it does to that at some point), you are actually controlling physical hardware states directly from your own code. If your goal is to run everywhere, though, you're likely to die of old age before you finish handling all of the hardware your program will see, so I can't really recommend this approach.

So yes in that it is theoretically possible to target the x86 hardware directly, no in that it is generally not a feasible option. ",2020-05-14 19:43:27

Just like any language there is an R way of solving problems and once you get the feel for that you’ll write better code but you really ought to understand a lot of concepts about the language to effectively use it. For starters one should learn about all the base objects used in the language and the three most common OOP systems in R (S3,S4 and R5). Then you might want to choose a data structure library you like and learn how that community uses those tools. One of the most popular library collections is the tidyverse. After that learning some functional programming concepts would be helpful and naturally that requires understanding R environments. If you’ve mastered those things you can use R to do a lot. 

I know quite a few PhD statisticians (R is more statistics leaning btw) that don’t make any of their own objects and seem to use a small subset of what R is capable of. However, they often have sprawling code bases that are hard to manage and they rewrite the same code a lot.

671,ggewrk,False,Help,2,Using graph theory to solve airline scheduling problem,computerscience,"Hello. I am an Aerospace engineering student. I recently started learning about graph theory. I had an assignment about air transportation and I had to create an efficient schedule for an airline connecting 4 cities. we solved that manually. I was wondering if I could solve this using graph theory.

The problem statement in short:

An airline has 3 identical Aircrafts(AC1, AC2, AC3). This airline connects 4 cities (BOM, KLH, IXG, PNQ).

There need to be 4 flights for each pair of cities. for example, 4 flights for BOM-KLH, 4 flights from KLH-BOM (directed graph) etc..  time taken for going from each city to every other city is given as a matrix.

Create an efficient schedule for this airline to complete all the flights considering the following constrains:

1. There should not be more than one aircraft present (landed) at an airport at a time
2. each aircraft needs to visit BOM at least once and stay there for 2 hours for maintenance. (Ignore this constrain for now)
3. Each aircraft needs 30 min of time to prepare for next flight after landing (turnaround time)
4. All the flights should be completed in a time window of 48 hours.

Meaning of efficient schedule: A schedule is efficient when the aircrafts spend less time on ground (idle time) and spend more time in air in total (not more than the flight time in each flight). minimizing idle time will benefit the airline as the airline can pack more flights in given window and less airport charges.

So what confuses me is that let's consider a function f. According to a definition from a text book it asserts that f is called recursive, if there is a Turing machine that computes it (for all input strings output of the machine should be equal to  output of the function given the same input). 

But in general, we say that a function is recursive if it calls itself or maybe firstly another function and then that other function calls our initial function again and again until some initial condition.

So these two definitions are seems to be different. Should I choose the meaning of recursion based on context or am I missing something ? Thanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/grhojr/turing_recursive_definition_vs_general_perception/,1,"The first usage is old-fashioned, and dates back to the era when computability theory was called recursion theory, and similarly computable functions were called recursive functions. For the most part the field has moved away from that terminology but some textbooks still do it the old way (such as your textbook) .

Note that even if some text were to use the word recursive in both meanings, one should be able to understand which is meant by understanding what type of things they're talking about: the meaning where recursive=computable is a property of (some) mathematical functions, whereas the latter sense of recursive is a property of code/algorithms (which might implement a given mathematical function). Thus for example addition of integers and the factorial  are recursive functions in the sense that they are computable, and some particular implementation of one of them might or might not be recursive in the sense that it calls itself. So as long as you can figure out whether the text is talking about a mathematical function or of some code implementing one, you'll know what recursive means in that context. ",2020-05-27 11:03:49

Very, very high level view: when you start with C, the clang front end is converting this to LLVM IR. The LLVM IR is then transformed, optimized, and lowered in the middle end. Finally, a back end converts the LLVM IR to machine code. This canonical 3-stage compiler is super nice because it lets you abstract away shared infrastructure (if you build a new CPU instruction set architecture, e.g., RISC-V, you only need a new backend; if you develop a new programming language you only need a new front end) and it lets users hack on the compilation process by writing new transforms that get injected into the middle end.

I wanted to attend law school and was a paralegal upon graduation for in house counsel for a FinTech company in DC. Long story short, I realized I was more interested in finance and the development side of the company. Transferred positions as a paralegal in the company to a Business Advisor to get more of an account manager/loan advisor experience with hopes to go for my MBA. I love. However, while in limbo between the two positions (about a month), I interned with the Dev team doing some minor, excel ""data analytics."" I did fine.

Bottom line, I am starting from scratch. I could make an easy move to finance and to get my MBA and maybe go towards a high end Relationship Manager role, which would be my end goal. However, I cannot shake the thrill of computers -- I grew up with three older brothers who were all techy and computer nerds. Safe to say, I was exposed to computers and technology growing up.

It's logic and structure to give random assortments of data meaning. So when you look at all the different languages and techniques, the best thing to do is not to be scared of them, but to remember they all work to this goal. Along with this, remember that all of programming is made by people as opposed to physics that is dictated by nature. Not every concept will have a nice meaning and you'll encounter things that don't make sense until you see them enough.

A little more practical, pick a language that is forgiving to begin with. You can adapt almost all code into any language, but some are nicer than others. These are organized from high to low level. The lowest is machine code. 1's and 0's whose meaning is dictated by the instruction set. And the highest level is something like html or java. I recommend starting at high-level and going down. Python and Java are pretty smart and can be nice to beginners, while something like C is going require you to have a lot of knowledge and be a diligent programmer to make good work.

I also saw that in compile-time and load-time binding, the logical address and physical address is the same. So, won't the user program be able to access or see the real physical address. When taking this case, isn't the above statement false?

Another doubt I have is :
The compiled code has the absolute address of physical memory in it. Doesn't that create a problem? I mean, the logical addresses itself is created to protect the data on the physical memory. If the compiled code has the absolute physical address, then the true meaning for using logical addresses is lost, right?

At any moment the OS may physically relocate any code section, modify the code's physically mapping address registers, then continue processing. The programs themselves never see or even know any address translation is occurring. 

However, for some hardware - like certain microprocessors commonly used as Arduino targets without any significant OS that performs such memory address translations - the addresses a program references are exactly the same as the physical address. This is also true for certain data processing systems that must be certified for critical processing (think flight computers onboard a commercial airplane) so the chances of failure are as small as possible.

The Graph: 
I am using a grid like graph where i one after another add some edges. So the graph has about the same amount of edges and vertices and has no weight's nor is it directed. Before i add a new edge i want to check the distance between the 2 vertices i am Connecting and later decide on that result whether or not i want to add this Edge. 

My question is, is there a Data structure that allows me to find the Distance between vertices in less then O(N^2) (wich would be just a BFS for the other Vertex)?

* [Optimization version of decision problems](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/943/116761)
* [“NP-complete” optimization problems](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/989/325)

The way the posts and answers are written, I get the impression that **many** problems such as **enumeration**, **counting**, and **search** problems can be framed as **optimization problems** even if they are **NOT** necessarily formulated as [mathematical programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) problems (i.e. finding a solution to  an explicit objective function).

Take achine learning for example, one can and often casts **decisions** and **search** problems in ML as minimizing some form of e.g. expected loss, e.g  **minimizing regret** of making ""a mistake"" (e.g. **decision problems** in complexity theory could be framed that way), or e.g. minimizing any other form of expected error. This formulation is ubiquitous in ML.

What does this say about the general **reducibility** of many problems to **optimization** or **search problems**? 

Beyond ML, one could imagine doing the same for these problems:

* Count all [hamiltonian cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) in a graph
* Find the [nth Fibonacci term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)
* Find the [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of a set of numbers
* Enumerate the subsets for which [3SUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM) answers ""Yes""
* etc.

In other words, given how often we do this in ML, can one always ***easily*** reframe or *reduce* non-optimization problems to optimization problems using a loss function? e.g. argmin𝑥 𝑓 (𝑥) where 𝑓 is a measure of error defined for the solution space of the desired problem? Or is that reduction **not** always *easy*, or maybe not always feasible?

More ambitiously, how does the ***family*** of complexity classes (and their associated types of reductions and definitions) for **search**, **enumeration** and **counting** relate to the family of **optimization** problems?

In my experience, the way that they taught the classes and concepts were all in different coding languages- every semester we learned a new language, from C to C++ to OCaml to Java and so on. I feel like I was just trying to cram and keep up with classes, which caused me to lack the depth in each language since I was just trying to pass the classes (stacking like 4 CS classes each semester) so I could graduate on time. The lack of depth hits hard when I'm faced with simple tasks like creating a simple program to do \_\_\_ or coding challenges that are open ended.

All the projects that I've done is through my classes- no internship, no side projects- and the projects that I've done have mostly been really small ones with a lot of help and backbone code provided to the students.

731,fqfaqe,False,Help,3,Can someone let me know if my understanding of amortized run time in a dynamic array list is correct?,computerscience,"Am I right in my understanding for amortized time for insertion in a dynamic array list? (dynamic means create a copy double its size and copy existing elements to new one WHEN we reach the current size limit). Please validate my explanation/understanding.

If we insert X elements into an array of initial size 0, it will perform the heavy operation (double size then copy) only at insertion number 1,2,4,8,16,..,X where each operation costs a function of X f1(X), f2(X), etc. I'll explain why they each cost a function of X below.

all other insertion operations like 3,5,6,7,9,10,11, etc is O(1).

the function of X which I mentioned above is because f1(X) + f2(X) +..+ fi(X) = 2X. where i is the number of heavy insertions. Proof: if you reverse 1,2,4,8..X, and sum it, you get X+X/2+X/4+..+1 = 2X.

Hence, total execution time is O(2X+j.O(1)) where j is the number of easy operations. (3,5,6,7, etc) **<-- THIS is the part I want to verify if my understanding is right or not**

therefore, total time is O(2X) = O(X)

but since we are looking for the time of only inserting one element, it is O(X) / X = O(1)

hence amortized time is O(1)

Last question: why is it called amortized? Where did I amortize anything?

Thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/fqfaqe/can_someone_let_me_know_if_my_understanding_of/,2,"The reason we use amortized analysis as in your case is when the operation is *costly* but only at certain (and less frequent) situations. 

The ""insertion"" operation*cost* into the dynamic array, when the current array size (x) is a power of 2 would be x+1. In other situations it would be merely just 1 operation, as we need to just insert an element at the end of the array (this array has space). 

Now according to the method, we need to find the average number of operations that is required for inserting ""x"" number of elements. 

The method is straight forward.

x th insertion     1  |   2   |   3    | 4 |  5   | 6 | 7 | 8 |  9   |               

Number              1 | 1+1 | 2+1 | 1 | 4+1| 1 | 1 | 1 | 8+1|
Of operations


So total number of operations for x insertions would be 1 + (1+1)+ (2+1) + 1 + (4 +1)+ 1 + 1+ 1+(8+1)+1... i.e. x + (2^0 + 2^1 +  2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 +...2^k)

Where k = floor (logx base2)

i.e. x + 2^(k+1) -1       ( sum of gp series)
i.e. x + 2*2^k -1
i.e. x + 2x -1
i.e. 3x -1
 
This is total number of operations needed for x insertions. For average number of instructions, it is (3x-1)/x ~ 3x/x = 3.

So on an average 3 instructions for insertion operation. According to big oh notation, it is just constant i.e. O(1).

The mistake you are doing is, you are applying big oh notation while calculating the number of operations itself, which is wrong. Big-oh notation is for the order of growth of functions. 

So calculate the average number of operations and see how many steps (operations) it requires. Those average number of steps will be in terms of your input x. This itself is your function. You can't just apply big-oh where and when as you like it. ",2020-03-28 07:04:42

    End Subprogram",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/fq6uyc/what_is_the_output_of_the_pseudocode_below_if_the/,1,"Let's examine this program line-by-line:

    Main
    Declare X as Integer, Y as Integer
        Set X = 1
        Set Y = 2

Two variables of type Integer, `X` and `Y`, are declared and initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.

    Call Sub(X, Y)

We call the function `Sub` with two arguments, specifically the `X` and `Y` we just declared and initialized.

    Subprogram Sub(Integer Num1, Integer Num2 as Reference)

We are now in the function call `Sub` with the two arguments. Now, in the definition of this function, we pass the first argument by value and the second argument as a reference. This means `Num1` in the function is a *copy* of the first argument, whereas `Num2` is a *reference* to the second argument. What this means is that whatever value is initialized to `Num2` will also change the value of `Y`, which we passed in. In contrast. any change to `Num1` will *not* have any affect on `X`, the first argument we passed in.

    Declare X as Integer
    Set Num1 = 3
    Set Num2 = 4

We declare a local variable `X` also of type Integer. We set `Num1` to 3 and `Num2` to 4. Remember that `Num2` is a *reference* to the argument passed in, `Y`. Thus, `Y` from the `Main` function is now initialized to 4. `Num1`, on the other hand, is just a copy of `X` from the `Main` function, so it can be thought of as a local variable.

        Set X = 5
        Write X
    End Subprogram

We set the local variable we declared earlier in the `Sub` function to 5 and write it to the console. We then exist the function and return to `Main`.

        Write X
        Write Y
    End Program

Remember that Y *now* has a value of 4, since we passed it in as a reference to `Sub` and initialized it to 4. Now, We initialized `X` earlier in the main function to be 5 so we write 1 to the console and since Y is now equal to 4, `Write Y` now prints 4 to the console. That is how the output is 5 and 14.

1. Work out how your game is going to work - in detail.

3. Figure out how your users are going to do stuff (turn-based, “real-time” - they’re basically the same but orders of magnitude harder to code)
4. Based on 1,2 &3 break it down into what the various actors and data structures are. (you’ll get this wrong, but as long as the basics are solid, you can iterate and correct)
4. Pick the language that’s most natural to you and start implementing. Don’t worry about the interface yet - get the mechanics working.
5-99. Iterate - especially if this is your first rodeo, the first few iterations will be awful, but you won’t realise until later. This stage can lead to initial AI implementations - and that may result in a premature entry to step 101

In fact, there's an algorithm that can compute this in O(log b) time. From what I understand, you split b into its powers of two, and then compute the product of a raised to those powers, taking the mod whenever possible to avoid integer overflow.

For example, take a = 10 and b = 29. You can split 10^(29) into 10^((1\*1 + 0\*2 + 1\*4 + 1\*8 + 1\*16)) = 10^(1) \* 10^(4) \* 10^(8) \* 10^(16), and keep a running variable that keeps track of the current element to be multiplied, making sure to take the mod of it whenever it is updated. Since only log b elements are being multiplied together, this algorithm is O(log b).

You can write readable plain CSS if you want though, just try to organize your rules in a way that makes sense to you and stick with it. CSS performance... Learn about what causes a web browser to reflow and repaint, and try not to do it. Also, try to have as few CSS rules as possible and don't make rules with long hierarchies. Re-usable? You might have a site-wide stylesheet and either smaller stylesheets for different pages OR specific names for elements with a unique theme. [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com) has lots of good resources on this kind of thing ([https://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/](https://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/)).

I think an important aspect of HTML reusability + readability is templating of some kind. That can be through a javascript framework, web components, a static site generator (like hugo), or something on the server-side of your app that can stitch together HTML files (rails, good ol' php). Efficient HTML? Lazy loading images could help with page load time, but that's more of a javascript thing. Slow HTML will likely come from interactions between CSS + HTML or JS + HTML.

795,hkxsfz,False,Advice,13,Study techniques for Computer Science/Software Engineering,computerscience," Hi guys,

I need help when it comes to studying Computer Science. I am a Software Engineering student but I am thinking of transferring to CS.

I do well in my internal assessments such as in assignments and practicals. I can understand the content too but when it comes to exams, I do really badly. It's easy to score well in internal assessments because I am tested on the content I learned a week a go and hence I have the content fresh in my memory.

The issue is when it comes to exams. Studying for exams become overwhelming because I need to go back and revise content from week 1 simply because I have forgotten the content. It seems I don't have a study routine I can stick to and I don't know what studying techniques I should use to study CS/SE.

I watched a video from the channel called ""Ali Abdaal"" which was about how his friend writes up a document filled with questions and his friend tries to answer the questions he came up with to test his understanding. His friend was studying medicine. And I thought this was a brilliant idea but I am not too sure if this is a good technique for CS/SE because CS/SE is not all about knowing answers and memorizing. CS/SE students have to apply.

I am not interested in anything like doing the pomodoro technique because I find the content I learn interesting and hence have motivation to learn. I am willing to study. I feel like what I need is a way to study and a way to keep all the content I learn in my head or anything that is helping you guys to score well in your studies.

I would love to hear some advice from CS/SE students who are doing very well with their studies and what you guys do to get those awesome grades. I have been getting crappy marks because of exams and I hate it so much.

Thanks guys for your time. Appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hkxsfz/study_techniques_for_computer_sciencesoftware/,2,"Computer science is like math or physics - you study theory but you also need to solve as many problems as possible (in compsci this involves writing code at some point, if necessary, but you can also just write solutions in pseudo-code to show that you understand how to do it).

Anki can help you a lot to study the theory. For example, you are taking a class in Operating systems - there is some theory involved, use flash cards or Anki to retain that information. The class will also have a practical component (hopefully), where you can solve problems and write code.

If you are a geek, you can set up Emacs to write the Anki cards in it and then ""upload"" them bulk to your running Anki instance. You can use ""snippets"" in Emacs to make writing the cards easier and almost automated. The advantage of this and associated org-mode is that you can mix latex, figures etc. into the cards.

If you are not used to solving problems and have never taken courses where you had to do so (and got tested doing so), you need to up your game and start doing it. Some sciences (like biology or geography) or humanities (like history, languages etc.) do not involve this approach and instead, rely on memorizing things and being tested on that or writing essays.

Understanding how CPU works on the hardware level, first you need to understand transistors, and how they can be used to create logic gates (i.e very simple TTL.) Once you have logic gates, you can abstract to wires + gates, and look at a very simple ALU.  


You could create a 2/3 bit adder using a few transistors.

Secondly, understand that this career, nor any career, is a good fit for everyone.  If you love this discipline than a betting man will bet on your success.  CS is hard....full-stop.  A good curriculum should be challenging because the industry is as well.  Only you can know if this is your path, but I feel that if you can look past the difficulty and still see enjoyment then it's simply a matter of 'sweat currency', work harder/smarter at it.

I've always loved CS and I often say I have no regrets, but that's a bit of an overstatement.  One evening after struggling endlessly on a particular course I found myself in my car on the edge of dropping out of school, driving south to find a completely different life.  After about 2 hours, \~120 miles I gathered my thoughts, cooled down, and returned to the library for 'round 99'.

I have some questions for you. I'll put them on the bottom because I'm going to give a bit of a background first that you may not give a darn about.

I've been a public safety officer (cop and fireman) for a couple of years now. I'm 29 and I am getting out of this profession and getting into coding. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Michigan and was in the Marine corps right out of high school. Obviously, I don't have much that screams coding / computer science / web development experience.

I have been working with Codecademy and other programs for about a month now and I love it. I enjoy finding solutions by piecing different parts together (or using Google until I have a better idea). I have a website that I created using Wordpress from before I started learning any coding. All of the random codes that I put into this site was just copying and pasting from Google or inspecting other sites.

My questions for you if you choose to answer them are:

&#x200B;

* What can I do to gain experience for hiring into places?
* Does it look better to have college classes, online courses, or experience?
* Where does calculus come into coding / computer science?
* At what point can/should I put ""knowledge of HTML"" or any other language on a resume?
* What languages or other qualifications should I focus on to get into this career as quickly as I can?
* Any other advice?

&#x200B;

Any help is greatly appreciated. I'm down to talk and learn about anything I can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hhpfo2/cop_to_coding/,2,"I've been programming since I was \~10 years old in some form or another. I graduated with a bachelors in CS / math about 3 years ago. Been working in the industry since. Hopefully some of this is useful for you.

1. Practice leetcode or other algorithm / data structure challenges. These are the types of questions that many companies ask during interviews, maybe tying in an application of the type of work they do (e.g. Amazon might ask a question about programming a shipping algorithm).Additionally, build software! If you want to become a web developer, build a website that does something interesting. If you can't think of any ideas, just make a clone of a website that you use, or of something you find cool. You can put these projects on your resume and use them to job search with. Post them on github so employers can see them.
2. Experience is probably all that matters. If you show you can build a piece of software competently with your projects, employers will be attracted. Certifications don't hurt, though.
3. Calculus is used in some applications of computer science, but you likely won't see it in your day to day work unless you have a specialized job that requires it. Most schools require it for CS because it is useful to understand in some cases. Definitely not a requirement, and I know many successful developers who dropped out of high school having never taken any advanced math.
4. When you feel confident with it. Putting something on your resume is giving the interviewer permission to ask you about it. If you don't feel confident being asked questions about it, don't put it on your resume.
5. Web development is hot right now. If this is what you want to do (which I assume you do since you're asking about HTML), then I think you're headed in the right direction. I would add into the mix CSS (and more advanced SCSS), & javascript. After learning about these topics, you could move into learning about a popular web framework like React, Vue, or NextJS. These are a few of the technologies employers are looking for right now. If you're more interested in backend systems, servers, or anything that isn't web related, you might find C (or C++), Go, & Java more interesting.
6. Since you are a public safety officer, maybe you could try looking into some companies that are related. Having the experience you do, I think of companies like Axon that might be particularly interested in hiring you. They could appreciate insight from someone who's been in the shoes of the person using their product.
7. Don't be scared off by a job listing's ""required skills"". Most of the time you might not know 50%+ of what is on the list, but they still might be interested in hiring you. It is rare you will find a job listing and be able to check all the boxes. Apply anyways!
8. Consider taking an internship first. They won't expect you to know much, but it is a great way to get your foot in the door. Showing you are interested and passionate about technology in the interview can get you the opportunity.

Each player must outwit their opponent and make a path with their coloured tiles, either yellow or blue, to connect the two opposite sides of the 18-squared tile board. The first to create a pathway that reaches the other side is the winner! each player starts with 30 small tiles that are three squares long, one medium tile that is four squares long and one long tile that is five squares in length. To begin the blue player places one tile of their choice anywhere on the board. The yellow player then places a tile anywhere on the board and this continues until one player creates a pathway connecting their opposite sides of the board and is crowned the winner! players can start as many new paths as they want to, a new tile does not have to touch earlier tiles that have been placed. You cannot put a tile on top of your opponent’s tile but you can be clever and block their path. ",2020-07-13 07:31:55

Find a tutorial on the basics. Then find a project and start smashing some keys.

If you have a specific goal (coding a game, or an OS), choose a language suitable for it and learn that.

If you want to learn coding and problem solving in general:  

Start by using Python to get a feel for coding. Its a great beginner language because

* Easy, readable syntax
* Built-in BigInt support
* Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Extensive Libraries 

Almost every function you are gonna use has been implemented, so you can focus on using them rather than trying to implement them.

After you feel comfortable coding, move on to a more restrictive language, like Java. BigInt and Dynamic Memory Allocation don't come by default, so you have to do some calculations beforehand in terms of memory usage (or just use the library functions).


By this point you will have enough experience to know what to do next. 

^(After that move onto C, and learn about pointers. C is even more restrictive than Java because it also doesn't have BigInt or Dynamic Memory Allocation, but on top of that, no Bounds Checking or Garbage Collection.)

846,han4zz,False,Advice,2,Advice?,computerscience,"Hello! A little bit of background to this: I'm going into my 4th year as a CS major. I'm a first-gen college student and don't have much prior experience with CS as I never had any experience with it besides a week long introduction to coding hosted by WiCS (Women in CS) in which we messed around with simple coding with physical input. I applied to colleges as Undeclared and/or CS and the only reason I joined the CS major was because I came across it in the list of majors and found the description of it interesting.

In my experience in my CS classes, I have learned the basics of a few languages. Yet more and more so I feel as though I'm behind a lot of my classmates in knowledge of CS topics. I hear people talk about making websites and working on side projects and that's not something I've ever done. I've never had a drive to push me to do more than is taught in school and I don't know how to integrate CS as an interest in my life rather than just something i need to learn to do an assignment. 

I only learned about Github in one of my CS classes and haven't really used it much apart from downloading notes every now and then. Also, I don't know how important things like LinkedIn are for eventual employment in the field. 

Any and all advice is welcome. How can I become more involved in CS? What can I do to find more topics regarding CS? What are you interested in about CS? Anything you're excited about, I'd love to hear. 

Thank you in advance, I appreciate anything you can offer!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/han4zz/advice/,8,"Note: wall of text incoming, so skip to the TLDR if you want

What was it about CS that piqued your interest initially? You should go down that path, exploring new sub-fields of CS, until you find something you genuinely like. Forcing yourself through CS, or pretty much anything in life, is almost never the way to go. No amount of advice can instill artificial passion in someone, but I think your problem is not that CS isn't interested, but that that you haven't explored enough yet to find something worthy of interest.

I just graduated but I was also in your shoes as a first-gen student, and especially in a field like CS, I understand how daunting it initially seems to have no background, no head start, or any help to rely on from parents or relatives. I too chose CS half on a whim, and realized the skill disparity compared to my peers early on in college. However, you should use the clever people around you as a goal. Most of my freshman year I only studied CS for the sake of completing assignments or exams, and I sucked at nearly everything. But somewhere down the line, seeing how advanced my friends and classmates were motivated me to reach or exceed their level, and it comes as no surprise that a good friend group + environment is key. Clubs, hackathons, and advanced classes are good ways to go about obtaining both.

I got into competitive programming because one of my first uni friends was on the programming team and introduced me to it. I later got into computer vision research because one of my other friends was into machine learning (and while his specific field wasn't of much interest to me, it helped me eventually stumble across CV and other applications of ML, which I found I loved). To this day I continue to engage in both, inside and outside of school and work.

What's important to understand is that rarely will any school's curriculum walk you through everything, so much of what your classmates know (as you correctly realize) comes from what they've done on their own time. There's an abundance of resources and platforms (i.e. Coursera, Udacity, most interview prep sites, etc.) online at varying levels of expertise that cover various topics in CS, so you can go from knowing little to near-expert independently. It's okay to be behind (everyone starts somewhere), but there's no excuse for *staying* behind. 

That being said, if you aren't motivated by your classmates but still want to find something you love, many undergrad catalogs contain paths of study that are more specialized (cybersecurity, robotics, etc.) later in the curriculum (generally taken in the 3rd-4th year). Many of these coincidentally also take you from theory to something tangible, which is probably what you want. So dip your toes into all such paths, either on your own time or in your final year. If not motivated by personal interest, perhaps courses themselves will guide you to something you like. A lot of the process of finding things you like is based on luck and just putting yourself out there into unexplored territory. Who knows, CS might not even be what you actually want to do, but you won't know that until you've tried all of it.

As for the rest (like Github or LinkedIn), those usually just come along the way. Sure, you can showcase projects on Github, but first and foremost it (along with git) is a tool for collaboration and version control, and you should use it as such. Git can be learned from its own guide or a plethora of online resources, and you'll only get familiar with it by using it. Networking on LinkedIn is important and a huge benefit, which should be taken advantage of in college, and while it isn't necessarily the be all and end all of *landing* a job, it can surely help you *find* some.

**TL;DR**: put yourself out there by exploring things on campus or online, find like-minded people to bounce interests off of, and attend relevant events where you're outside of your comfort zone. Everything else will likely come along the way naturally.

Messages are then decrypted using he private key.

If you’re talking about encrypting the data you’re transferring within your code, then you should look to the standard libraries encryption tools. You needed to be more specific about what technologies you are working with, and especially which part of the handoff you are trying to encrypt. If its something along the lines of a python/java web app, then you should be looking into the native encryption libraries.

863,hfx307,False,Advice,1,Multiple Producer Single Consumer circular buffer,computerscience,"Hello all,

I am looking to implement a multiple producer single consumer (MPSC) circular buffer in c++. I was wandering if I can implement a more generic case of Multiple Producer Multiple Consumer (MPMC) circular buffer that could also be used for specific case of MPSC. Will using a MPMC circular buffer create a large overhead for MPSC case, that can be avoided if I was to instead implement a MPSC circular buffer?

If anyone has any experience with this or knows of some resources that I can use, I would be grateful if you could share some insight. 

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hfx307/multiple_producer_single_consumer_circular_buffer/,2,"This appears to be a synchronization problem. You need to ensure that only one producer writes to the buffer at the same time. Therefore you need to ensure that the function that adds value to the buffer and moves current pointer to the next is atomic (meaning it always either finishes or doesn't start at all and is not interrupted).

My suggestion is to generate references and save them into buffer because copying value might create too much latency and causes a massive backlog.

So that's all about creating a buffer. Now to a single consumer. You're rightfully wondering whether singe consumer is going to be enough to keep the buffer from overflowing and I think we either do not have enough information or it is only possible to learn that by actually trying. So I wish you good luck at implementing your idea. ",2020-06-25 23:56:38

Anyone can write code but an engineer will do it without introducing breaking changes.

This means focus on a way/process of introducing changes/features that doesn’t break things. If it’s a new feature you’re introducing so you can switch some existing functionality to make use of it, don’t start integrating straight away. Build the new feature in isolation whilst the old method remains in tact. When your new feature is ready (tests exist for the code and pass) you can then write a test that makes some assertion about how the new functionality should return results once integrated. It will fail. You can then update the code to make the test pass. At no point did the code break in between. Finally you can now remove any redundant/dead code to complete the job.

Most developers will just start hacking away at the new feature, updating the code in place, hitting road block after road block. Then because they’ve broken the system, they stress and stress that they’re doing a bad job, which isn’t necessarily the case. 

Very few developers I’ve worked with got it right early on, myself included.

If you can prioritise which bits of the system to change first so that you don’t introduce breaking changes, programming becomes a far more logical process rather than a headache. ",2020-06-20 19:25:00

TLDR : A 2020 grad with a degree in neuroscience and philosophy wants to know more about going back to school for a second comp sci degree. The questions are in **BOLD.**

Hi guys,

I recently graduated (Spring 2020 - a couple of weeks ago) with a BSc in Neurobiology & Philosophy (double major) from a state university. At the moment, I am planning on going to medical school and am taking about two or so gap years. This is quite ignorant of me, but I realized how hard it is to find a well-paying job or at least one that just doesn't have grunt work with just a neurobiology degree, if one doesn't go to graduate school. There are also job out there for people with biology degree and those that have research experience (me being one of them) - but those are normally super competitive due to the sheer number of biology -related graduates, and with COVID-19, most research departments have hiring freezes/ cutting costs. I can definitely get a job with a philosophy degree (I was surprised to find that out as well), and am currently looking but it would not be ideal as it would not get me closer to my goal - of getting more clinical hours and patient exposure.

Additionally, I did not have a backup plan coming out of college and did not realize early enough that even if I were to do everything right in terms of strengthening my application during my gap years, there is a pretty high chance I might not get into medical school - in my first, second, and even my third round. I know of people that have better stats than mine, and are overall excellent, well-rounded candidates that should make it, but still haven't gotten in after their second try. Therefore, I would like a backup plan in case that happens to me. In addition, this might seem pessimistic of me, but I also want a safety net - in case, 1 in a millionth chance, I don't like being a doctor. I am simply trying to be as practical as I can be and not waste time and money.

I am thinking that during my gap years, during which I am aiming to find a *clinical* job (Right now) that would expose me to doctor-patient interactions, and where I can work directly with patients, I should get a second degree in Computer Science\*\*. As of currently, I am trying to find ***any*** job, but that's irrelevant to this. These are the questions I have for you guys:

1. **Is this the right subreddit to post this? or should I post elsewhere?**
2. **Should I get a BSc or a MS in Comp Sci?** : I looked through most of subreddits related to Comp. Sci and found there to be conflicting opinions, somewhat dated. I'd rather skip the undergraduate requirements, but I do not want to skip the core classes given how fundamental they seem. TBH, I was quite confused myself per the different programs and requirements from different universities and what was better or worse in each of the programs. I figured I should ask people in the industry. **Which programs would you guys recommend for someone like me? The cost should be the last factor.**
3. **How much times does it normally/on average take?** Given that I will be working, I would like it to be part-time. Would the degree (BSc/MS) be completed in two-years or so?
4. I am looking for the positions of Software Developer/Systems Analyst/Engineer/ Machine Learning and AI - given my background in Neuroscience - T**herefore, what are the absolute requirement as for courses I should look for in a program given these positions?**
5. I know there are online programs for non-CS majors - ideally I would like to go to a physical class/university - although I realize how it might not be feasible given how long this COVID-19 pandemic might go to, **but any thoughts/opinions on these online programs? Should I stay away from any of them? Any outstanding programs that would fit my schedule?**

My undergrad was business (took few extra classes before to enroll to the MS) and I only have 3 classes left before to graduate (or 2 semesters including this summer).

I have two options:
1) Take 1 or 2 summer class this summer. In that case, i will have to find an internship for Fall 2020 or I will have to take classes and graduate by December 2020. 

2) No summer classes. As I need to take only 2 classes per semester and currently 3 left. I am still going to be able to do an internship in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021. 


My issue is I am going to turn 25 and I already took a semester off for a family issue last year. I am not sure how hard it would be to find a full time in January 2021 if I start to look right now. 

In term of work experience:
- Reservist for the Marines in my country (2 years)
- 2 investment banking internships 
- business developper for a start up for 8 months (full time).


Projects (school) 
- WW2 search engine. full stack: python, ElasticSearch, css, html, js). 

- Geographic project (team project, can’t five much details but it’s currently available on the web), i mostly worked with spring boot testing and the user service (OAuth2). 

- Plagiarism detector (team project - full stack). Was working on one of the algorithms (java) 


Projects (personal)
- designed, builded and deployed a job search platform for a start up (they paid me 1500€). This is a full stack project, the back end is pretty big.
- designed, builded and deployed a very basic (with minimal design) website for my uncle’s clothes shop. It’s only front end right now, i added all articles manually (we didn’t want to have a back end).

- GPA 3.25/4.00

What would you do? Do you think it would be much more harder to find a full time in a decent company without any strong relevant experience as a Software Dev?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gmkkih/graduting_without_internship/,6,"In Austin and the SF Bay Area, there are meetups that are basically job expos where you ""speed date"" with recruiters, mostly from startups but sometimes the larger companies show up as well.  HackerX is a company built around setting those up.  If you aren't in a major tech center (SF Bay Area, Seattle, LA, Austin), it might be more difficult to find one of these.  They are an excellent place to network if you don't have a network and I've always been impressed by something when I've gone to these just to check them out.  Be humble, be confident.  Have an idea of what kind of software you want to write, be it frontend, backend, or full stack, or maybe something completely different like devops or infrastructure, or maybe you want to focus on ML and data science.  They want all of that.

This will of course be difficult in the current hiring environment where companies have cut back on headcount, startups are struggling to find funding, etc.  You might want to consider looking at positions in state government IT departments as a hold-over if you can't get a foot in the door elsewhere.

Your background, believe it or not, actually makes you a more interesting candidate.  Focus on your leetcode problems, your algorithms and data structures, and I have no doubt you'll be able to ace the technical interviews.

To really come across as a winner, I would recommend looking up the leadership principles for large tech companies like FB, Apple, Amazon.  It's not enough to show technical brilliance in interviews at those companies; they want to see that you have a solid sense of direction and correctness of attitude towards the work that fits in with the company culture.  Expressing a growth mindset in the interview helps a lot and will take you very far.

My recommendation would be Amazon, specifically the AWS org.  They hire a lot of people directly out of college, at any age, and while it might not pay the best and you might have to relocate (although in this environment and with amazon's worldwide presence, it might not be to Seattle), it's a fantastic way to start your career even if you only stay for 2 years.

Unfortunately I did not do this subject at high school level and due to quarantine I want to get a head start with some basic programming just to be prepared. The language the course uses is C# and Unity so any advice on where to start with the basics would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: pasted the course components on here

 

**Component 01 – Computer Systems**  
This component will introduce students to the internal workings of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the exchange of data and will also look at software development, data types and legal and ethical issues. It will also offer the opportunity for students to analyse and design algorithms, and to study different types of software together with the methodologies that are used to develop them. This component involves advanced mathematics, including the representation and normalisation of floating-point numbers, the simplification of Boolean expressions, the use of two’s complement to represent numbers in binary, and using rules to derive or simplify Boolean expressions.

**Component 02 – Algorithms and Programming**  
This component will incorporate and build on the knowledge and understanding gained in component 01. In addition, you will study:

* What is meant by computational thinking
* The benefits of applying computational thinking to solving a wide variety of problems
* The principles of solving problems by computational methods
* Using algorithms to describe problems
* Analysing a problem by identifying its component parts

This component focuses heavily on the reading and writing of complex algorithms including Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and the A\* algorithm. Again, Mathematics is a feature of this unit, including the use of Big-O notation to assess the complexity, in terms of time and space, of an algorithm.

**Component 03 – Programming Project**  
Students will be expected to analyse, design, develop, test, evaluate and document a program written in C# using the Unity development environment. The underlying approach to the project is to apply the principles of computational thinking to a practical coding problem. Students are expected to apply appropriate principles from an agile development approach to the project development. This project is independent, meaning students will need to debug their program and spend time focused on the development of a complex piece of software.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/ggigti/trying_to_get_a_head_start_on_my_alevel_course/,1,"Definitely just dive in.

I know basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of compliers and interpreters. I think with a medium amount of struggle I can build a JS parser to build and read expressions.


The material will span algebra, geometry, calculus, discrete math, physics, etc. Lots of different kinds of rendering is needed. Ultimately this will expand to very advanced subjects like measure theory and quantum mechanics. So you can imagine what goes into automatically and randomly generating both algebra expressions and geometry diagrams, and then more. It's going to have to use something like LaTeX, Geogebra, maybe both, maybe something else.


I've been handling the text with MathJax, but that can't do geometry diagrams. I could generate the diagrams in a separate software, but then that can't be embedded in the page so the user can generate them on-demand. I started looking at LaTeX.js but the diagrams don't render as expected and there's minimal documentation of this. The code is open source but I'm not proficient enough to be able to understand it. 


Now I'm willing to spend years studying CS to figure this out. In fact I'm currently studying computer architecture and will soon study operating systems and network science.

916,g37c3c,False,Advice,7,Having Doubts About My Computer Science Degree,computerscience,"Since high school my(19, Second Year) plan was to go to school to double major in Computer Science (CS) and Musical Theatre(MT). Two different fields I know but hear me out.

I first started with just to major in CS since I was intrested in computers; built my first pc at age 13 but wasn't that familiar with software. My family always said things along the line of ""Hey you'll make good money."" or ""You'll get a good job if you stick with it."" Then thorugh a series of events I joined the theatre department in HS and I fell in love with it. Ended up doing my first musical outside the school and from there I knew I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.

I wanted to major in MT in college, parents said that I could so long I got a degree in CS also to back it up or to fall back on. I agreed, devised a plan that I would get my degree, work as a Web Developer scheduling my own time and going out for auditions for productions after graduation. That or going to graduate school for theatre while working web development.

Fast forward to college, my first two semesters were spent i gen-eds, getting pre-reqs done for CS and taking Theatre and Dance courses, (eventually picked up a Dance minor as i grew to love it also).

My abilities in MT grew expenetially while I waited on CS courses, fast forward to last semester and I took my first CS course Introduction to Python and did decently in it; struggled but I understood it. It helped that I had a really good professor to boot.

This semester however, I am taking Introduction to Object Oriented Design with a professor who, while nice, isn't a great teacher at all (Sitting at a 1 on Rate My Profesor). Took her session of the class as I had a mandatory class with MT in a time period with arguably a better proffessor. She instructed us in BlueJ instead of Eclipse as she found it to be easier, but its not the greatest enviornment. In class lectures are slow and would drag on, content itself was difficult to understand, and the assignments feel exsessive.

I could get by before with the information provided in class. Now since COVID-19 and classes being online, the class has become way worse. We'll meet as a class for roughly half-hour and the professor won't go over the subject matter for the week. Instead she goes over assignments that are due for the week and if you have a question she can answer it. Leaving to read the text book for going over the subject matter. I feel like I'm teaching myself here and barely understanding it. I want to ask a question but I feel as if i don't know enough to even know what I'm asking. I'll go through the whole chapter, taking notes on everything covered and still not understand it. When I get stuck on our weekly labs, I end up getting frustrated and going to stack overflow to find the exact same assignments and how they solved it.

I feel liek a fraud. I've lost motivation for the class and the major itself, I want to drop it or maybe change to a minor. I feel if I'm struggling in something that should be basic, then how can I be successful at all down the line? The major has also been taking time away from my Musical Theatre Studies and vice versa. I feel like I'm half-assing both at this point and filled with constant doubt in both areas. My work ethic and enthusium my freshman year was so much higher compared to now. The past week I've even had night terrors about this. Running around my campus in an endless loop because I left my backpack somewhere. Last night, I had one where I decided to go back to HS in order to relearn basic stuff becuase I didn't feel good enough.

I still want to stick to my plan but is it at all realistic? Should I choose what I love doing and soley focus and knowing I'll make it work? Or should I stick with CS the notion that I'll be financially secure even if I'll struggle to find a job that'll take someone like me.

edit: Well, looks like I have alot of thinking to do, thank you all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/g37c3c/having_doubts_about_my_computer_science_degree/,7,"I went to acting school, got a BFA in drama. Now I'm getting my masters in CS.

Personally, I love CS because it makes sense to me. I got out of theatre because it doesn't make sense. Not talking about the classroom - there was always catharsis and profound meaning there. But out in the world that's a lot harder to find.

I have tons of friends who couldn't live without their theatre lives, and that's great. But there is a myth that in order to be a ""successful artist"" you have to kill yourself for your art - that's the only thing you can do. In fact, whether or not you like it, you will *have* to do something else to make a living. There just isn't money in art. ...You know, until you're famous. Spoiler alert: you won't be. You have to be ok with that.

So my suggestion: if you love your art, don't give it up. If you enjoy CS, let that be your survival job. If you hate CS, find something else to survive on.

Either love your work or allow your work to enable what you love. Both are valid paths in life. Just be realistic about the world waiting for you with an art degree.

(Sorry I can't help with your struggles in CS classes. But being in art school and surrounded by this do or die ethos was so toxic. Don't get sucked into the myths.) ",2020-04-17 18:14:14
917,glt8s2,False,Advice,2,What should I have learned by this point in my CS career?,computerscience,"I just finished my second year of my bachelor's in computer science. So far, I've only taken 5 CS related classes (the other ones being math requirements and general Ed's). So far I've taken Intro to CS, where they taught me about the parts of a computer, the history of computers, and an intro to logic circuits, Boolean algebra, binary operations and pseudocode. Then I took Principles of CS I, which was basically a C++ course and the last thing we learned was classes and inheritance. Next, I took Principles II, which was the same as Principles I, except that it was C# this time, and we got into object oriented programming. I also took Object Oriented using Java, which was the same as the previous two but using Java. Finally, I took discrete math, and towards the end of that class, we were studying trees, and in one particular example our professor mentioned something about search algorithms, and that we should've been familiarized with those since the majority of us were taking Principles II at the same time as discrete math. The thing is that we never studied such thing in Principles II, so I don't know if my math teacher was wrong, or if our other professor didn't teach us what he should've been teaching us. He was somewhat of a substitute teacher for the last two semesters since the original CS professor retired, and they didn't have enough time to find a replacement. Is this all that I should know at this point? Or am I falling behind because of my professor?

TLDR: Basically I've only learned some C++, C# and Java programming and discrete math at the end of my second year studying CS.

DNS, Domain Name System is the protocol used to translate names of urls into IPs. This is necessary for computers to send IP packets to each other.

DNS has a hierarchy system with the root servers like com, net, org...

You can buy a domain name in those servers so that you can own yourdomain.com

A DNS request will respond with the corresponding DNS records which there are many types of, one of them is SOA or Start Of Authority. These records allow you to nominate another authority under your domain thus creating a multiple domain name.

Now you can setup locally yourself, or through third parties that offer the service, subdomains for example email.yourdomain.com

You haven't been very specific on for what puyrpuse you want to do this, but take into account that you need to be able to either control or buy from the authority above you. You can't have a domain that is mydomain.google.com as google would need to include you in the dns records.

You cannot do what you are asking and DNS is build to prevent your use case for security reasons. The only workaround would be to buy a domain very similar to the one above you, for example yourdomain.yütube.com ",2020-05-20 14:17:59

Some people would say its going to get you a ""future"" job, or you can get "" 6 figure"" salary, or "" I don't know what to study so I study  CS"" . Yeah, all of these seem to be correct but I am neither one of them. I am not feeling that I'm better or smtg, in fact, its just that I rarely hear this reason from who study CS. I study CS simply because I really love the satisfaction of solving complex problems and spending hours thinking logic  of that  algorithm, just that simple. I never enjoy this kind of satisfaction in any of other subject area before. When I was junior in primary and high school, everyone sees that engineering, lawyer, accountant and doctors are good job, but, this just leaving me behind not knowing what to do. I follow everyone to study in science stream during high schl( bio math add math phys and chemistry are main subjects) in order to have more options in the future. Looking back, I was always choosing a safest choice. (being a student in Asia country, somehow we are expected to be good in everything)

Eventually I've graduated from my uni after struggling and Studying stuff I don't really like for years. And I've got an average result at my schl(A+, As, Bs) that allow me to study A level afterwards. The first dya I've got into A level, the very first class of CS, I've no idea what CS is, I choose CS SIMPLY because I don't know what to study at that moment. The first term I've got an C in my exam, I started to wonder if it's correct for me. All people around me typing at a GOD LEVEL speed which I still need to look for the key before I can type it. However, With days and nights staring at stackoverflow and youtube channels I manage to get a not exceptional, but I consider a decent grade for A level with 89 marks after all.

To be honest, I think I study CS simply becuz it's like a fun game for me. In Asia, everyone is so focus on the career prospects and how much we can earn in the future. Whatever I've learned in A level was just a very basic level of python programming and introduction.

Retaining information requires constant exposure to that information. There’s a reason you don’t remember the things you learned in high school, just like your parents, and that’s because you aren’t using the information frequently enough. You have to tell your brain that this piece of info is important, and you want it to stick. That usually comes most naturally with routine exposure. 

For CS, routine exposure is easy. Just code something—anything!

You’re right though; it is a lot of information to take in, especially when moving at a fast pace. This is where you learn to prioritize the key concepts: you can always google how to declare an array in java in an instant, but it’s a lot harder to reteach yourself what an array is. 

Hopefully this isn’t too over-simplified, and I imagine you’ll find a more detailed answer from someone with more practical job experience, but this is how I still remember learning my first language four years ago freshman year :D

My philosophy has gotten me this far: if you want to retain it, use it! ",2020-05-15 16:27:46

When picking out a profession it is important to have an interest for the topic itself, regardless of whether you are managing people or not. If IT is something you're interested in, start learning and building stuff now. You don't need a company to do IT. 

IT Manager is not a professional field in itself, it is a job that more experienced IT professionals who happen to have a desire to coordinate other professionals tend to take on.

In IT you typically have two directions to go after being in an entry level role for a few years. You can double-down on technical expertise and become a 'tech lead'/'subject matter expert'/'senior engineer' or go down the management route.

If the people-skills aspect of being a manager is what appeals to you, consider exploring professions that allow you to lean into that passion, like HR, training, or social work.

If you you are interested in getting started with IT, a computer will be important. Contrary to what other people might say, at your age I do not think you should focus on a checklist of things you should learn. Learning that way will get boring and tire you out. What you need to do is get excited. Think about something you want to build: a website, a game, a blog. Start googling (e.g. how to make a simple website). Soon enough you will branch out organically into the different parts of IT. At this stage in your education, having fun and getting obsessed with trying to make an idea come to life is more powerful that any textbook. If you bump into a problem that needs math to solve, you can learn the math then (ask your math teacher to help you!). Learning math with the hope that it will somewhere down the line help with IT (but not know exactly how it will help) is a very demotivating way to learn. ",2020-04-28 18:53:32

964,gibuqi,False,Advice,0,Python AI communication bot acting strange,computerscience,"Hello, so I have been working on a project for a very long time and have been testing it in reddit chatrooms for over 5 months now. My goal was to make the AI understand social interactions between users, come up with coherent answers and to understand the input (to a certain degree).

The AI learned autonomously - it first detected active users and ranked their language on a scale from -1 to 1. The ranking was divided into three parts - usage of forbidden words (swear words), word misspellings and gramatical structure.

It learned to rank users' speech by me feeding the AI thousands of ""verified"" books and articles via online. It did that semi-autonomously as well with me giving it directions.

Then it selected users to ""track"" and learn from. To be a guide for the AI, kind of.

AI created a separate section for each user to go in and collected data to learn from.

I gave it a bunch of freedom - it could scan and join every new subreddit chat. At first it got banned/kicked from a lot of them. These actions that were taken against the bot were considered as ""punishments"" and made the bot avoid the circumstances under which it would get banned. Also, after each ban it would stop chatting for 24 hours and was computing responses, out of which I had to manually select the correct answers it had generated.

Later on I coded the AI to to that autonomously, based on ranking sentences based on confidence scale.

So only a month ago i have achieved a goal for the bot to chat like a real human, it would generate accurate responses 83% of the time and didn't get banned once.

So after this whole backstory lol i am a bit puzzled right now. The database before a few weeks from now was about 5gbs of data, but now it started growing expenentially. It gains about 2gigabytes per day, increasing based on arithmetic progression. 

The whole data categorization has went to sh*t. It started producing documents with hundreds of thousands of characters that I have not been able to interpret or decode. I'm not sure what has happened but I think that someone might have tampered with the bot.

I am now looking through the logs and can't seem to find what caused this. It will take me much longer to find what is the reason for this whole thing. I have since shut it down, but I really don't want to discard this project of mine that I have been working hard on.



Do you have any idea what might be the issue? I know its hard to answer this without having the actual code or a problem listed, but this is more of a question to help me come up with ideas to fix it.



I was planning on selling it, so currently I will keep this API to myself, but if I'm not able to find the issue I will post it on github so that you can help me in finding what has gone wrong. I think I'd also make it open source if that happens.

I was doing fine till i saw moveToFront(String item) and moveToBack(String item). It's an array implemented queue of string items and the description is telling me to use enqueue and dequeue to achieve this. I dont understand how?? I tried it on paper.

E.g: 1 2 3 4 5; moveToFront(4); 4 1 2 3 5; (Rest of the elements stay).

Here's the actual description of both methods:  We need to find the given item in the queue, and then dequeue from the front and enqueue at the back until that item is at the back. 

Would appreciate any insight.

Doing so invalidates the purpose of the queue. What you need to do is to keep on dequeueing number from front and put them to back until the desired number you want is on the front of the queue.

Say you have 1 2 3 4 5 and want to put 4 on front...
First iteration: 2 3 4 5 1
Second iteration: 3 4 5 1 2
Third iteration: 4 5 1 2 3
Then we stop. We now have 4 on front. ",2020-04-28 15:11:40

You’ll also need to know to code (obviously) as well as all the details of a test framework and it would also be helpful to know something like Jenkins. Now, the difference is data structures & algorithms aren’t as important in your job. At this point you’re basically validating that answers are correct so the high-performance algorithms are already taken care of by the backend engineers. So if you’re more interested in developing new features for the end users or applying your knowledge of DS&A you’ll probably be bored in test automation.

Indeed, refer to the classic Babbage machine era.)
