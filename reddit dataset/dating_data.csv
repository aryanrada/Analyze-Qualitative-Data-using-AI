0,gz0pxh,False,Venting,512,Stop stringing people along just for sex. If you want casual sex go after someone who wants that’s too.,dating,I’m so tired of(some) guys knowing all they want is casual sex but stringing someone along who they know doesn’t want that because it’s been communicated before. There are plenty of girls out there that are looking for casual sex or fwb go find one of them. It’s really sad to deceive someone by making them think you want something more when you don’t it’s not fair to the person and honestly your wasting both of your time. Please guys that are doing this stop. It’s hurtful and manipulative.

1,cs5jz8,False,None,404,How to be an attractive guy.,dating,"All of this advice on ""how to read women"" and ""what to do/say"" is bs. Social ""intelligence"" and body language are two very idiotic concepts because those rarely come innate and are very hard to control. This is why us guys stress ""say what you want"" because social ""cues"" are purposely misleading and cause misunderstandings more than not. And yet most women *still* rely on them more than verbal cues. 

It took me 10 years to ""learn"" social norms and cues, and how to portray confidence. I've read every ""pick up"" and ""how to date/be attractive to women"" book and article there is. From ones written by Red Pill misogynists to ones written by hardcore feminists/misandrists. I've spent hours and hours reading and practicing. I've bought lesson after lesson.

**It's all a waste of time.** 

If you're putting that much effort into being attractive, *no one* will find you attractive. 

The best thing I learned after all this time is to sit down and really figure out if I like myself. If you do this and you don't like yourself, figure out what you don't like and change it. *Self-Love is the most important love you can have.* Self-love comes before *everyone else* besides your children. You cannot love someone else, til you love yourself. 

Once you love who you are, spend every day focused on what *you* want. Ignore every woman unless she's a part of your life. Think of it like this: as a straight man, when other random men pass by, how do you view them? You don't. You don't care. They could be invisible. 

Yet when a random cute girl passes by she immediately occupies all the space in your brain. 

And she's literally done nothing but have a good bone structure and probably some meat on her body. Big whoop.

As a man you are *going* to learn this someday in life: The most gorgeous super model in the world still takes shits everyday just like you. Stop putting them on a pedestal and hiding your emotions. If you're on a date and there's a silence and she seems bored, ask yourself are you bored? Is she entertaining you? Is she making you laugh? No? Then why are you so concerned about entertaining her? No matter what our media portrays, it is not your job to entertain women. 

Focus on yourself and making sure you're having a good time. Focus on your life and make sure *you're* having fun. I'm not saying be a complete asshole. You should always care about people, but **not** more than you care about yourself. I've gotten so much attention from women by focusing on myself versus when I used to try and focus on them. 

So that's my advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cs5jz8/how_to_be_an_attractive_guy/,4128,"Whoa dude, leave some pussy for the rest of us.

Seriously though, this is lame advice. ",2019-08-18 19:09:37
2,f44ijz,False,Venting,1161,RANT: Dating as a woman is NOT easier. Finding love as a woman is NOT easier. Finding sex is. It's not the same. We are just as lonely.,dating,"I'm part of the foreveralone subreddit because I haven't had a serious relationship in 5 years. Yet, none of the posts there describe me, and if I were to ever post anything, they'd chew me up so fast: I'm a woman, objectively physically attractive, it's very easy for me to get ""dates."" As a result, I'm not ""forever alone"" because people want to go on dates with me, right? Right?

Sure, let's agree that women, in particular, steoreotypically attractive women (young, fit), can get dates. Sure. Ok.

But number of matches in tinder does not equal love. Guys buying you drinks does not equal love. Guys sleeping with you and then GHOSTING you does not equal love. Guys leading you on and breadcrumbing you for WEEKS or even MONTHS  is not love.

And little tiny scraps of attention here and there, or even sexual interest, does not, in any way, somehow quench our loneliness.

We are still lonely. I'm still lonely.

Yes women can be lonely. Pretty women can be lonely. Women can be surrounded by the ""attention"" of 20 men and STILL be lonely. Hint: because more often than not, it's not real attention. It's fleeting, momentary, empty, and baseless. It will be gone. Very soon. Maybe by the night's end.

I'm just so exhausted of my feelings of loneliness being dismissed over and over. As if I didn't have a right to feel lonely or sad. Here's a list of all the guys I've ""dated"" over the past 5 years:

\- Guy that was gonna move to Asia in 3 months. Said he loved me deeply while simultaneously keeping a girl in Asia ""warm"" for when he got there. When I complained he explained that he was being logical, as he was gonna move there soon, he needed to keep his options open.

\- Guy who wooed me and made me laugh for weeks and then months only for me to discover he had a LIVE IN GIRLFRIEND back in his home country all along. Texts me that he misses me to this day.

\- Guy that i was crazy about that would generously grace me with his presence for 1 HOUR A WEEK for MONTHS. When I spoke up about it he said that was all he could do. Take it or leave. I took it. Even though I cried for the other 6 days every week.

\- Guy that slept with me for 1 entire year, gave me an orgasm ONE TIME in that year, and when I spoke to him about it, said it was my fault. After a weekend full of sex in which he came 6 times and I came 0 and I begged him to please try he accused me of rape. Said I was forcing him. I stopped talking to him. A month later he showed up at my house again, said he treated me so harsh because deep down he thought I was a ""bad person"" but that he (and i quote his exact words) ""still want to fuck"" me.

Those are the long term guys. In-between, I've had several other short-term ones, including the guy I went on 2 horrible dates with, was thoroughly confused when he kept on asking me out (we had no chemistry) and then ended up literally BLOCKING ME as soon as he slept with me and then disappeared. Or the guy who showered me with promises of fun date after fun date after fun date, only to completely disappear in a couple weeks too. But not block me or ghost me no- just string me along whenever I ask, make sure I'm kept warm in the repertoire.

I'm tired of being used as a sexual commodity, I'm tired of having my feelings played with. I want love. Real love. I'm so ready and willing to commit to one man only, to build a family, to build a life. I'm ready to give a man my all. But somehow because I can ""get dates"" easily is like Im not entitled to feeling lonely, to feeling unwanted. But how can I not feel unwanted when the last time I heard the words ""i love you"" were 5 years ago?

/rant ends here

EDIT 1: WOW THIS BLEW UP!!! Thanks for the Silver and 2 Awards!! Thank you so much for the kind comments, messages, and even chats I've received. My inbox is very full right now, I'm trying to get back to everyone. A few thoughts:

1. I was both glad/sad to read SOOO many women's comments with the \*exact same\* experience as me. Glad that we were able to find each other and provide support, yet sad that so many of us exist and are stuck in this conundrum.
2. I was also very pleasantly surprised and touched by how many men reached out in kindness and understanding! Even though men have a different experience when it comes to dating and romance, most men were able to put themselves in women's shoes for a moment and understand, even if for just a little bit, what our experience is like here on the other side, and how we can be just as lonely.
3. There were also very, very few (maybe 5 compared to the 2,300 that upvoted?) people that reached out, all men, with actual harassment and threats of physical violence. To those people I will not respond, but I actually wish them love and kindness. I've clearly had bad experiences in dating but yet, I don't hate men. Not one bit. It's the opposite: I am actively looking for 1 man I can give my heart and soul to, and try to find this man, over and over again. Yet, these \~5 or so men that contacted me with violence, do hate women. To them, I wish their souls are healed. You can never find love with so much hate in your heart.
4. Finally, to all men and women, gay, straight, bi, pan, or any other sexual orientation, that commented with similar feelings of loneliness and a deep desire to find love: I wish all of us good fortune. I hope we all find what we are looking for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/f44ijz/rant_dating_as_a_woman_is_not_easier_finding_love/,3552,"lol beware,you're going to trigger a lot of men that won't acknowledge the fact that women have a hard time dating,too.

but yes i completely understand.gave up on online dating a long time ago. i grew so tired of constant,useless,frustrating,obviously copy pasta messages like ""hi"",""sup"",""*insert random emoji*, ""wow your hot"" and so on so forth.i found good men but even after a few dates they said they were only looking for casual dating,even if they clearly mentioned on their profiles that they're looking for something serious,long term.

no,i won't date anyone cause i have a vagina.no,i'm not going to waste my time on somebody who clearly can't hold a convo and is obviously a boring person.i'm not that desperate even for sex,cuz unlike men,women are more prone to the dangerous sides of it.

3,dgizvi,False,Tinder/Online Dating,175,A tinder story,dating,"A few years ago, my girlfriend dumped me for another guy. I felt heartbroken. I’m not a very emotional person but I was crying for a whole day. I didn’t know what to do. I eventually re downloaded tinder. I got a few compliments and dates but nothing special and I felt like giving up. But then I saw this one girl. There was something different about her. 

She was everything I ever wanted. Smart, cute, athletic, motivated, helpful. She wasn’t like the ten gals that want to be stay at home moms and eat Cheetos all day long (no offense to any sahm) that I just swiped left on. I swiped right on her and I kept checking my phone for a notification. A few hours later she matched with me and we messaged back and forth for hours. She agreed to go out on a date. 

I was hit with nerves about everything. I freaking wore a red flannel shirt, ripped dark blue jeans, and black leather boots. I got a bottle of wine and spilt it everywhere. I thought it was done but she felt different. She viewed me as genuine. 

After a few more dates (that we’re also much better), we began dating. We got higher paying jobs and eventually moved in together. She has been my world for the past three years. Even if it’s just reading and drinking coffee on a rainy day, the view of her makes me feel the sun start shining. Tomorrow she planned a date at the original restaurant where we met for our three year anniversary. 

Tomorrow I will also be proposing. 

I felt lost and alone but I would feel like that all again if it meant I have her in my life. I am super happy to have gotten her father’s blessing, as it means I get to possibly have her in the rest of my life. Don’t give up.

4,fvhala,False,Tinder/Online Dating,138,Corona virus has a surprising benefit in dating,dating,"So I live in South Korea.  Here, nowadays, you rarely see anyone’s face because everyone wears a face mask.

So I matched with this guy on a dating app.  He’s a pizza maker/delivery boy about a 5 minutes walk from my apartment.  Probably have seen him a few times even.  But I thought he was cute in his profile, and moreover goofy, which is 100% my style

We had a plan to meet up later this week for the first time but today after work he texted me saying he just got off work and wanted to see (just my face!!) for a second.

I decided to be spontaneous and go, no makeup and leisure clothes in all.  I came out, and we immediately started going for a walk (masks on).

We ended up walking and talking and joking and holding hands for two hours.  (Don’t worry korea isn’t quarantined, my area is small and there was literally no one around) His profile only had one picture, so I wasn’t sure exactly what he looked like.  By the end of it, i realized I only saw his eyes the entire time.  I mentioned it.  But at the same time, I felt like it really didn’t matter.

You could also debate over when exactly a relationship becomes a relationship, but obviously there's always going to be some fuzziness, gray, or vagueness there. That's just how many concepts tend to be. 

Language in general is like that, and there will always be vagueness, but I think it's actually preferable for that vagueness to be situated on the lingual level rather than the more abstract, extralingual, conceptual level, and everyone reasonable should agree. Indeed that's the whole point of language too; it takes on all the uncertainty. Language wouldn't be as powerful if it were only used to express binary or clearly delineated notions; actually that's basically how machines work.

Think about it. You go to dinner, have awkward conversation over a meal, then sit quietly in a movie before going home.

Go to the movie first, and you have an immediate icebreaker. The movie. Get conversation going, and it's easier to jump into the about you kinda stuff. Not only that, but the last thing your date will remember is the fun conversation and good meal you just had.

Thank you for coming to my talk.

EDIT: So I see a lot of reasons why dinner and a movie are a bad thing, mainly ""You can't get to know each other during the movie,"" but in part that's the point.

Talking to people is a skill, and not everyone is good at it. To everyone suggesting this where it is you, the other person, and basically nothing else, I think you're missing this point. The movie first is meant to give you an entire movie with of things you can talk about to get the conversation started.

For the people saying ""dinner first, in case they're a creep so you can leave"" you can leave during a movie too. But awkwardness in conversation can be taken as creepy even if it's just a lack of knowledge on how to have a conversation.

18,gavzhm,False,Venting,275,I’m so fucking sick of the “let’s see what happens” culture in modern dating. This is just an excuse to avoid trying. Do you disagree?,dating,"I don’t know what happened to my generation, but somewhere along the line, I feel we lost touch with reality. Maybe it was online dating where you can shop for the ‘perfect’ partner or get instant gratification with a quick hook up. Maybe it was the rising divorce rates that make us feel love rarely ever even succeeds so what chance do we have anyway? Maybe it’s the ‘perfect life’ effect caused by social media. We see all of our friend’s successes, but none of their struggles so when we ourselves struggle it makes us feel isolated like we must be weak or shitty humans to not have achieved X, Y, or Z. Maybe it was Disney showing us that the relationships we’ve been waiting for will just sweep us off our feet effortlessly and without any intervention from us…it will just be fate.

I understand why you’d want to just see where it goes – it takes all of the pressure and responsibility off you. I mean, if you don’t try, you won’t be disappointed if it fails. If you don’t care in the first place, you won’t be hurt when it ends. If you don’t make yourself vulnerable and try to establish a real connection with someone, you can’t be taken advantage of or get rejected. Besides, when the ‘perfect person’ eventually does come along, it will feel so breezy and effortless you’ll know you’ve found them, right?

**FUCKING. WRONG.**

This is how you end up alone. It boggles my brain how people think that success just falls into your lap. Do you think that a strong marriage and happy family is going to ‘just happen’? I get that timing-wise things happen when they happen – but if you don’t create an environment that fosters the chance at that opportunity, it’s not just going to appear. Do you think if plant seeds in May but never water them that you’ll be eating fresh produce all summer and fall long? No! You might get a nubby cucumber here and there but you won’t be enjoying a bounty (this analogy means two things :P ).

I teach programming and I see this with students all the time. Some come into the class because they have to take it for their major but they are intimidated by its reputation for difficulty and they lack confidence; essentially, they expect to fail. So what do most of them do? Well, you’d think they would come to see me during office hours or get help from our tutoring center. They might read the textbook and take notes or watch YouTube videos for extra perspectives on the concepts…nope. Nope, nope, nope. They expect to fail so they barely try…and then they fail.

Just like my students, the same outcome will occur with dating. I feel my generation has given up hope and given up trying; this just further perpetuates the issue and reinforces our already harmful beliefs.

You get things in your life by taking ownership of your goal, pursuing it, and working hard to make it happen. I don’t just hand out A’s in my class and happy, healthy, strong relationships don’t just happen – to achieve either of those things, it takes work. Every day, you have to go out there and water your garden. If you don’t, how do you ever expect to have a harvest?

Edit 2:

https://imgur.com/a/7yFDOpn

Some polls I did on reddit mostly on r/polls recently really opened up my eyes to the possibility that a lot of redditors really have not had sex yet regardless of age. There are multiple problems with these polls mostly related to how representative redditors in these subs are of the general population. Also, some polls are misleading if you don’t take into account differences in age and gender (these differences had to be taken separately). Still, the results were so pronounced that I could not help but be moved by them. I got decent or good sample sizes for most categories. Head’s up though: there are some weird effects there too (idk wtf is going on with the results from younger age groups). Honesty and/or confusion could be factoring in too I guess.

Uploading the charts image to imgur has been leading to some fuzziness. Sorry. If you open within the reddit app you can’t see anything. If you open in the imgur app it’s clear.

Edit 3: I get it’s problematic to try to say redditors represent the general population when they clearly don’t. I’m not saying they do. This was a survey of the participants at the subs I used. That’s it. Getting data on this subject is problematic and controversial anyway. Most of what we get fed is probably skewed the other way however because people in the general population are probably more reluctant to offer if they’re part of a stigmatized population unless it is 100% anonymous. And anonymous platforms tend to not be representative of the general population for one reason or another. I think it’s a problem. Collecting data from health records is pretty terrible too if you think of it. How often are people really telling the doctor or nurse the truth in these situations? Probably not very often. So, yes the real numbers are going to be way lower in the general population than my numbers. But maybe it was good to see things from a population skewed the other way than what we are used to. My experience with social pressure and isolation in these circumstances was ridiculous. I know this is a huge problem.

26,ggw0y0,False,Other,67,I finally kissed him,dating,"I met this guy (22) during the winter at my (22f) part-time job that I've worked at over breaks ever since I was 16. I come back when I'm home from college. We started hanging out more and I told him I liked him, which he replied that he did too. We went on 2 dates, but we are both really shy, so we just held hands. Today after work, my best friend (who works at the same part-time job as me) made a small graduation celebration today at the park since I graduated via email at 10am this morning haha. After eating and playing games, we went our separate ways except for the guy and me. We stood outside in the cold for what must have been 20 or 30 minutes just making stupid jokes. He made sure my car started since it wouldn't start when I left work before. He stood at my door and I made a small stupid joke about me being short. Then I said ""if I weren't so short I would try to kiss you."" Then he kissed me.

I've gone on dates before, but have never liked a guy the way I like this one. I was never the one who tried to kiss first since I'm so shy, but I could tell we both wanted to and he's too polite to make sudden moves which is another thing I really like about him. The guys I've dated before were huge jerks and did not respect my boundaries like he does. I've wanted to kiss him for a while and it finally happened.

27,gl9lu1,False,Giving Advice,252,I've started calling out guys who ghost me and I've never felt better,dating,"It started when I went on a date with a guy from my gym. He was really attractive, honestly I thought he was a little out of my league. Or maybe he didn't think it was a date (we did meet on Hinge though) but he invited me to meet up at the gym again later via text, and when I pitched dinner or drinks instead, he went silent. Honestly, I'm so sick of that shit. We had friendly interactions and worse, we were likely to see each other again at the gym - not so with Covid but I didn't know that at the time.

In the past I'd've seen this guy around the gym after being ghosted and I would have been embarrassed and felt ashamed, but this time something shifted in me. He's the one who should be embarrassed! How hard is it to say no thank you!So, the next day I politely did it for him. I said something along the lines of:""I'll take the silence to mean you'd rather just be buds. Totally understand.""

By phrasing it out for him it made it easier, so he responded with a confirmation ""yes, just down to climb as friends"" and an apology for not answering sooner. But I didn't leave it there, I added ""Hey, I get it, rejecting people sucks. but on the receiving end it feels better when you use your words, and it makes it less awkward when we see each other around the gym."" He apologized again, and I made it clear we were cool, and it seemed like he left that conversation happier than just ghosting me and I left it happier too feeling like I got a respectful answer and I could see that he didn't actually have such disdain for my invitation or think I'm repulsive etc. And maybe I didn't owe him the kindness, but it felt good to think that with that conversation, maybe he won't ghost girls in the future. Maybe he'll remember what I pointed out, that it's so much more hurtful to have someone you had a nice time with just go silent as opposed to kindly expressing that they're not interested.

Anyway, it's happening again, with a casual hookup this time, and I intend to voice my feelings again. I'm not going to let these guys ignore the fact that I am a person who should be treated with respect. If you date someone or sleep with them, you owe them the respect of a polite response instead of the silent treatment. You don't even have to give a reason, but that dread of sitting around, waiting for an answer, slowly realizing they aren't into you and don't even respect you enough to say so - I'm not taking it anymore. I don't think I've dated assholes, just cowards, and when offered an out they'd probably rather take that out than just go ghost.

So I'm going to be polite and understanding, but I'm going to let people know that it's hurtful and that they should be better. And maybe it'll be a little ripple effect of positivity on the dating scene in my city. And instead of just feeling bad I suggest other people try it too - it feels kind of powerful honestly.

Edit/Update: Despite a lot of people not liking this advice, I had another really positive interaction. I just let him know that I hoped if he didn’t want to hook up again he’d say so and not ghost, which gave him an opportunity to say that he doesn’t and for me to say that I understand, the worlds crazy right now etc. He answered after that and was genuinely kind and I feel like we closed out on much better terms than if I’d just “let it be” or accepted that I’m not owed anything and that’s how it is. Now he doesn’t feel guilty and I am not sitting around, checking my phone, wondering if I’m being ghosted, etc. That dread of not knowing sucks and now we ended on good terms and I don’t have to sit through it. Maybe my approach isn't for everyone but I think it was good for me and my ex-hookup in this case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gl9lu1/ive_started_calling_out_guys_who_ghost_me_and_ive/,1617,"Being ghosted on does suck, I’ve been on the receiving end of it.

30,cv4b1l,False,Other,70,"Met the cutest girl on a plane today and got her number, had to share the story with someone",dating,"I was flying home from CA and met this super cute girl while walking down the ramp to our plane. She's a biology student in Idaho with gorgeous eyes, a sweet smile, and frankly just stunning from head to toe. After only a few minutes we found several things we had in common, and I even got her to laugh a couple times. She ended up sitting way behind me on the plane but I really wanted to see if I could get her number. So I ripped out a page from the in-flight magazine and wrote her a note that said:

*As a scientist I'm wondering if you'd be willing to help me with a survey. I'm trying to find the best way to get the number of a cute girl I met on a plane (just in case I'm ever in southern Idaho) and wondering if a note is effective. If you would like to participate, would you be willing to rank its effectiveness on a scale of (000) 000-0000 to (999) 999-9999? For science. You can submit your survey by folding this piece of paper and leaving it in the storage door below the mirror in the bathroom behind you. If not, no worries and safe travels. :)*

So I take this note and walk back to the bathrooms on the plane, and as I'm making my way back to my seat I lean over to her and say ""I'm sorry, I think you dropped this"" and walk back to my seat. The flight had about another 90 minutes before landing, so I tried to wait toward the end of the flight and made my way back again. She had her eyes closed listening to music as I passed so I didn't get to see her, but sure enough I walked into the bathroom and her note was there! It said:

*My scientific curiosity is piqued! I'm happy to respond to your survey, as I always enjoy meeting new people. Oh, and my name is \_\_\_\_\_ by the way...""* WITH HER NUMBER!

She even kept my original note to her, hopefully because it was memorable? I can't believe it actually worked.

Also, here's how much I \*do not\* have game...I was so excited that I accidentally left the note in the goddamn bathroom! \*facepalm\* I got back to my seat, realized what I'd done, and practically sprinted to the back of the plane. A woman got out and took one look at my face and I knew that she knew. Haha, her face said it all. I said ""did I leave a piece of paper in here?"" and she said ""yes, I just threw it in the trash.""

31,f8dpgf,False,Tinder/Online Dating,83,RCMP saved my embarassing butt after a tinder date,dating,"So I went to a tinder date's condo recently. He came down and to get me so I didn't have to buzz to get in (i.e., fob to get into building and elevator). 

We had dinner and got into it. Now, we realized we weren't a match so after we were done and the alcohol leaves my system, I was hoping to leave without waking him or any pleasantries. I did exactly that. 

Once I got to my car I realized I FORGOT MY PHONE. My phone with my driver's license, credit card, and more importantly, Google map to get me home!  It was 2:30am at this point and I was going through the directory at his building to find his name but couldn't find it. 

I didn't know his last name. I didn't know his buzzer code. I couldn't get back upstairs, I couldn't drive, and I did not have the direction to go home. 

Thankfully, the RCMP (royal Canadian mounted police) station was across the street so I had the most dignified walk of shame to the police. After explaining the situation, one of them just went into the station to get the master fob to the building so I can knock on my date's door instead of getting a full report... Since it was clearly embarrassing and I didn't know my date all that well for them to look him up...

The officers were super nice about it. One of them reassured me that they face different situations everyday and that as long as I was safe and could get home, he was happy. The other officer made me feel better by saying at least now I can have a great tinder story plus a potentially good online review after I get my phone back to tell the world how the RCMP really did serve the community that night. 

The best part was, once they got me into the building and up the elevator, they hid in the corner so my tinder wouldn't see them when he opened the door in his boxers. 

Let me just publicly praise the Coquitlam RCMP pair who got me through a tough and awkward night. Thank you for protecting and serving last night. I've never felt more safe and part of the community than I did last night when tinder opened the door.

Tldr: I left my phone at tinder date, didn't know how to contact him so the police helped out. I got my phone back with a great little tinder story.

There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted soap-boxing plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included black-pill ideology and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of things with you. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose site of what dating is really about.

35,feexqq,False,Question,469,Would you use a dating app where you need to listen to a 15 minute podcast of a person before being able to message them?,dating,"I am creating a new dating app primarily for people looking for serious relationships.

Each profile you see on the app would have a verified picture and a 15 minute audio (recorded in an engaging format suggested by the app).

EDIT: **You will be able to message the user after you listen to atleast 5 minutes of their audio**. (There is no need to match). However it will be communicated to the other user how much of the conversation you have listen to (to incentivise people who put in more effort)

If you don't like a person, at any point, you can skip them immediately. 

The primary assumptions is that
  1. Audio recordings convey so much more about a person than a text based profile.
  2. You might take the other person more seriously if you know that they spent between 5 to 15 minutes listening to you before messaging you.

One of the format I picked to be used is '36 questions that can make you fall in love'. The idea is to give a structure that makes it very easy to create a profile. Of course only have to answer the questions that you are comfortable answering.

Just to give an idea about the '36 questions' format, they start with lighter ones and go deeper as you progress. Here are some examples. 

Q1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?

Q5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?

Q10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?

Q13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?

Q23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people’s?

Q30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?

So I let it go. And these small things began to grow into big things.

You can try and hold onto a relationship like that. But it’s water in your hands. Give it enough time, and you’ll be left with nothing, wondering who turned off the tap that had flooded you with happiness for years.

And so she was gone.

“I’m not leaving you to be with him” she said, the last night I saw her. “I just need to find myself in the world”.

Seemed incredible timing that they started dating a week later.

And you know what?

Despite the turmoil of seeing the ground approaching and having no way to exit the relationship gracefully...

Despite them celebrating their 6 month anniversary just 5 months after we broke up…

I get it. Because you don’t choose who you fall in love with. I could never hate someone for that. But you do choose how you handle it.

You can cheat - like she did. Or leave on your own - when you feel the waters running dry.

That’s where the most important unspoken boundaries come into play.

They’re not what you ask of someone else. But what you ask of yourself.

The greatest unspoken boundaries exists inside of you.

And it’s up to you to acknowledge them, not ignore them.

If you wake up and your attraction to your partner is gone, if you wake up and your respect for your partner is gone, if you wake up and your love for your partner is gone…

Then you need to pack your shit and go.

Once you fall out of love with someone, you leave.

Staying, and prolonging their pain by giving them hope, is a boundary you never cross.

Because when the waters of your relationship run dry, it’s not fair to make your partner think life-giving rain is on the way, when the earth is permanently scorched.

Oh and also don’t eat the last slice of pizza when I’m hungry.

* Women don’t have it easy simply because there are a bunch of guys who want to have sex with them.

44,ho1yrf,False,Venting,214,My WORST Date Ever!,dating,"Hey everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. You know the drill. Also, I'm on mobile. 

I thought I would share a funny dating experience with you all, maybe some people will get a laugh at my expense. Enjoy! Also, buckle in, cause' this isn't a short story. 

I (22f) went on a date with a guy (25m) a few months ago (pre-Covid). He seemed nice enough over text, and we had some similar interests, so I agreed to a date pretty quickly. I suggested a quick coffee date for a first time, but he was really insistent on ""taking me out for dinner, on him"". 

I'm a laid back gal, so I said, sure, let's go. We sit down at this Mongolian restaurant. Waitress comes by, and I order soup. As this is happening, he is talking OVER the waitress trying to take my order. At one point, the waitress literally stopped speaking to me, turned a full 90 degrees, and just stared at him with her lips together. I don't blame her. 

He laughed like it was a joke (?), THREW his menu up in the air for her to catch, and said he was ordering for me. She caught it, cause she's a great waitress, and simply turned back to me to take my order. Wanting this date to end already, I just order a bowl of soup (I hoped I could eat it quickly, pay, and get the heck away from this man). 

At this point he's ordered, although he said that his ex was ""the kind of bitch that can't take a joke."" I have no idea if that was a dig at me, his ex, or some combo of both... 

THEN, he starts going ON, and ON, and ONNNN about his ex. He called her every colourful name in the book. I don't mind swearing, but I do mind the use of the c-word in a crowded restaurant filled with children. I asked him to stop swearing so loudly, and he basically blew me off saying I was ""being ridiculous"". The angry eyes of the other diners didn't strike me as ridiculous, but okay. 

My soup finally arrives (let's be real, it had probably been 10 minutes, but every minute was agony). At this point, he hasn't done any of the following: 

A) introduced himself in person; he just sat down with no introduction
B) asked me anything about myself
C) Stopped his monologue about his ex long enough to breathe 

I use my food arrival as an opportunity to cut him off, and to change the subject. I ask him about our common interest - video games. I hoped maybe he would answer, then I could answer, but instead he stands up, and tells me we're going on a walk. 

I point at my soup, which is hot, but growing colder by the second. I ask if I can at least, finish part of my soup before it gets cold. He denies this request, and holds out his hand for me to grab (what a gentleman *eyeroll*). So, I call our extremely patient waitress over and ask to get it packed up. Keep in mind, his order is still somewhere in the kitchen, so I don't understand why he wants to leave without it. My BS-senses are tingling, so I tell him I have to use the washroom. 

Before he can say anything, I literally SPRINT to the ladies room. I call my best friend, and tell her to call me in 3 minutes with SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to get me out of this date. She's chucking a little, and I can't blame her. I'm a grown, adult woman standing in the toilets of a Mongolian restaurant begging my friend to get me out of a situation I put myself in. 

When I get back, his food has arrived and he has now, apparently, decided to stay (?). My soup is a bit chillier now, but tasty. He speaks super briefly about video games - but then goes right back to talking about his ex, what games they used to play, and, of course, what a bitch she is. 

I gently stop him and say, ""Hey, I'm uncomfortable with this line of conversation. I understand you dislike your ex, but surely you have other interests?"". He takes this as an opportunity to tell me about how his ex stalked him, and apparently stole something from him (?). 

At this point, the clouds part, and an angelic voice in the form of my ringtone sings out across the restaurant. It's my friend, telling me she... Oh no! She what? Broke her ankle falling down the stairs at her house? Oh god! I, of course, being the good friend I am, rush to help.  

I tell him I have to leave, it's an emergency. I stand up, but so does he. He says something about me trying to ""escape the best date he's ever had"". I chuckled, and tried to move around him, so I can get to the exit (and my car). 

He stops me with his arm on mine. I pull away, but I'm pretty small, so I'm not even sure he noticed my attempt. He tells me he NEEEDDSS a ride home, that he lives on the other side of town, and could I please drive him. At first I'm saying no, that I have to go, that it's an emergency. I even offered to give him a 20$ for a cab (anything to get away!). Then he points out we are in a bad part of town (he's right) and if I want his ""dead, lifeless body"" on my conscience. 

Ugh, fine. I agree to drive him home, against all better judgement. The drive is quiet, for once. I've resigned myself that I will not be able to get a word in edgewise, but he seems to realize he's being ditched. I don't really care, he isn't a very nice person. 

As I pull into his driveway, I put the car in park. I turn my head slightly to look at him, asking if he has everything (I do not want this man to have any excuse to contact me again). Keep in mind, my body language is screaming that I don't like him. I'm leaning away from him, despite facing him, and my face has morphed into a nasty scowl. 

This FUCKER had the absolute balls to try to kiss me! Read the room, buddy. I shove him back but he pushes against me anyway, kissing me on the lips. I bit him, hard, and told him to get the hell out of my car. He calls me a ""fucking tease"" but leaves. Thank god. 

I did make it home, and yes, my friend made a MIRACULOUS recovery. 

The story ain't over yet folks. 

About two weeks later, he's been texting me non-stop (I'm talking 3am, 4am, 5am texts). Finally, I simply text back that I'm not interested. Well. 

He first starts insulting me, THEN he apologizes (keep in mind, I'm getting about 30-40 texts all within 5 min during this convo). Then he starts trying to BARGAIN with me to sleep with him. He says things like ""I'll never bother you again, but I really want to f*ck you"". And ""Please, just have sex with me. Please?"" 

I tell him to, frankly, get bent. I now realize that he's a ""NiCE gUy"" to the extreme.  I blocked his number. 

Well, that's my worst date ever! One for my history books, at least.

48,g848rk,False,Giving Advice,133,This is what I've learned from my previous relationship,dating,"Everyone says that every relationship that you have, either a good or a bad one, teaches you a lesson. However, it is easier said than done. We often think about how much we suffered, or how we wish we would've done things differently. Tonight, I stopped for a second, distanced myself from all the pain that I've been feeling, and made a list about everything that my previous 3 year old relationship has taught me. I hope you like, and feel free to share your thoughts! Here it is:

1. Love does not overcome everything. It takes a lot more than just loving someone, in order to make a relationship work.

2. You can love someone to death and still not wanting that person to be in your life ever again.

3. Respect is actually more important than trust. Let me explain. You can lie to someone and gain their trust again, even though it is hard (and it definitely depends on how much you ruined someone else's trust), but once you lose respect about someone else, it's almost impossible to respect them again. I mean, you can try, but in the long run, it will be a problem again.

4. Don't overlook the red flags. This happens mostly in the beginning of every relationship, you're so drunk in love with your partner that you try to brush off every red flag that you come across. Don't do it. It will only get worse over time.

5. If you're in a relationship, both of you will make time for each other, and neither of you will have to ask for it. Once you do, and you feel bad for asking your partner to do so, something's wrong.

6. Always be aware of the way that person treats their parents (especially their mom). They won't treat you any better than that. (obviously, I'm not referring to toxic family dynamics, that's a whole different thing). 

7. Both of you can change throughout the relationship, and grow together as one. But, don't expect someone to change really rooted patterns. It will only hurt you, and your partner.

8. If you breakup with your SO, and he/she says ""I'll change for you"", don't give him/her another chance. Not only they won't change, but they should want to change for THEMSELVES, regardless of the outcome of your relationship.

9. Communication is the key to everything. If you're willing to talk things out and your partner is always trying to brush it off with a silly apology, your problems will only grow until they become unbearable.

10. Love yourself more than anyone else. If you don't, you'll become submissive and you'll lose your identity throughout the course of your relationship. You'll become more and more dependent on your partner, and it'll be a hundred times harder to say ""enough is enough"".

11. I believe in second chances. But you shouldn't give more than that. Once you do, they think you'll never leave and it'll only get worse.

12. Besides cheating, there are wounds that can never be healed. When you find yourself thinking about getting back with your ex, think about everything that has been said or done, and if you could look at that person differently. 
If not, then don't go back. You may miss that person, you may still love him/her, but sometimes, there's just too much damage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/g848rk/this_is_what_ive_learned_from_my_previous/,1373,"Ah who hurt you, bröther. ",2020-04-26 00:02:13

I see the points people are making, and I should have been more clear. First I guess I shouldn't have said ""immediately"", because he said he's going to try it out for at least a month, and I wouldn't even try to ask him to quit without trying it out for a good while first.

53,ebr1nv,False,Giving Advice,197,From experience: Mixed Signals are almost always no intention of actually pursuing a relationship/date. Mixed signals are usually “I like the attention you are giving me” and that’s it.,dating,"I am 35 (male) and I wish I had learnt this years ago. Really “learn it” not just know it. 

In my experience about 99% of the times someone throws you constant curve balls that just means they are playing with you. They are not being mean, their brains deceive them into thinking you know what they are doing. 

Learn this: Even when someone texts you randomly at night, or they go out with you but remain at arms distance, or say nice things about how good they feel around you, BUT won’t become romantic, they are just using your attention.

Become romantic means actively seeking or agreeing to be alone with you at night. Feeling confortable with being alone with you. Seeking or allowing touching and lingering of such touch. Obviously kissing and holding hands. 

Romantic doesn’t mean telling you their secrets. Constant texting. Non flirtatious compliments like “you are sweet” or “you make me happy”. Asking you out on things they want to do but no one would do with them...

Curve balls also include texting you but then leave you hanging when you ask for a date and then changing the subject. Telling you about how awesome you are but then dating someone else. Going out with you, **constantly allowing you to pay** but then telling you they have an early morning and then you seeing in their social media they continued the night somewhere else.

Attraction is almost instant in most cases, if someone wants to feel you and touch you they will soon enough. Don’t waste a lot if time waiting for it to happen. If someone is throwing you curve balls just move on.

54,gwlctn,False,Other,261,One of the most attractive things in a man...,dating,"...is the ability to run his own household. Honestly, I‘ve dated all types of men.

There was the one guy who was very sweet and kind but came from a Greek island so had been raised by the stereotypical Greek mum. One of his uncles had lived with my date‘s grandmother until the day this uncle married his wife. And his wife was only deemed acceptable after her cooking had been tasted. This uncle never had to cook his own meals in his life. My date had been culinarily spoilt by his loving mum as well which led to him somehow thinking that it was sufficient for himself to put onions, Frankfurter sausages and ketchup in a sauce pan to make pasta sauce.

Then there was the guy who was great at cooking but never ever bothered with tidying up. It was so stressful. I am not the tidiest of people but every 10 days to two weeks I‘ll give my flat a proper tidy and clean up. I clean my bathroom weekly and my wee vacuum robot vacuums every other day. But this guy‘s flat and house were just...they looked like he‘d just moved in, several years after he had. 

Then there were the guys who could neither cook nor clean, one’d keep plastic cups full of put-out cigarettes around for ages before throwing them out and always order in or eat out. One‘d have months worth of fizzy pop plastic bottles piling up (in Germany we get cash for them, so returning them to the supermarket is actually great!). 

And finally, I dated one guy who was actually able to look after himself. He meal-prepped every Sunday: veggies usually with chicken breast or other healthy meats, or pasta or more or less anything. He‘d cook all his own food, clean and tidy his place to a decent normal level, wash and iron his work clothes...sadly I‘m not dating him anymore but honestly, his ability to run his own household smoothly was just so attractive. Maybe I’m just judgmental but it just gave me an impression of self-sufficiency and autonomy and I KNEW that dating him would mean I‘d have an easier time sharing the household chores equally. Rather than me doing most of the chores as women in straight relationships are likely to do. Him running his own household in a healthy manner was just a very mature and manly behaviour that made me very happy. Maybe I‘m weird.

Edit: Okay, this has blown up. Some people ask me why did I break up with the last guy, or why did he break up with me. You can read this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/fswlyy9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Other people have asked me about where I dated these men and where they were from. One guy was Greek, one was Cypriot Greek, one was half-English/Asian (will not disclose nation), one was Australian (the tidy guy at the end) and one was German. I dated the German in Germany and all the other ones in the UK. I actually forgot another guy, half-English/half-French, who also ran his own household perfectly well.

Edit 2: Here‘s a speculation on why that guy stopped loving me, [click](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/fswqeya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/,1329,"Is honesty.

55,dtdxew,False,Venting,229,My first date in years was a disaster,dating,"I recently took a break from working 80-90 hrs a week and just focused more on my health and life. I met this girl on Hinge, and while I wasn't super attracted to her, I also haven't gone on a date in many years. Thus, I said ""what the hell"" and went on a date with her. That was a big mistake. 

From the moment we sat down, she starts talking politics. Oh no. She tells me she's a major Trumper supporter, which isn't an absolute deal breaker, but when I asked her why she supported him, she said ""I like what he's doing with the minorities."" Now, mind you, I'm ASIAN, so I'm just cringing super hard and chuckling awkwardly to prevent a full on verbal assault. 

Then she starts talking to me about the penises that she's seen. She tells me that Asian guys have pretty small penises and that she hopes my ""pecker"" isn't too small. Now, I don't think I'm a small guy, but it definitely made me feel very insecure and a bit curious as to what the hell is wrong with her. I quickly changed the topic to pets to avoid another awkward conversation. 

Finally, as we're leaving the restaurant, she tells me about how guys who participate in gangbangs/threesomes are all gay because they like the sight of other men's cocks. This was not a topic that I was well versed in, so I made another effort to change the conversation. She then tells me out of nowhere that she doesn't like gay guys, and that's why she'll never participate in a threesome with two guys. At that point, I just wanted to get away from her, so I nodded and smiled at everything she said.

As we're getting in our separate cars to leave, she starts smoking a cigarette and then kisses me on the mouth. It wasn't great. She notices my grimace and laughs and says ""my daughter doesn't like me kissing her either when I'm smoking"". This was a real shocker considering we are both somewhat young, and her profile had no sign of any kids. I quickly said goodbye to her and drove home to take a stiff drink. Now I see why people say dating can be so exhausting. Weeding through the list of incompatible people is herculean, and the ones who find their soulmates quickly are truly blessed.

Edit: some context on why she acted that way: to be fair, she was going through a lot in life. She just broke up with her boyfriend of many years who refused to pay rent on the house they leased together. They broke up because he wanted to join a swingers club and she did not. Anyways, she had a plethora of money problems, and she had a lot of “first date anxiety” which I suppose could explain all the weird conversation topics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dtdxew/my_first_date_in_years_was_a_disaster/,1329,"I've never read a story that sounded more fake, how does this have 1k upvote ...

60,hqjbls,False,Venting,596,I’m surprised at how normal it seems to be to expect sex relatively fast,dating,"The other day I read a comment from a guy saying that if a girl hasn’t had sex with him by date 5, he assumes that she’s either not interested in him or not interested in sex in general and moves on. This seemed like quite a leap to me, but I marked it as an outlier and moved on. 

Today, there was a whole thread about it where many people agreed that it was a huge problem to not have sex/sexual contact by the 5th date. Is this view really that common? 

I’m someone who usually likes there to be a good emotional connection/building of trust first, and to me it seems a little wild that this is supposed to happen by the 5th date. If the dates started with the person as a total stranger,  I feel like you’re still just at the tip of the iceberg with getting to know them by 5 dates. 

I don’t know, I was just shocked by this consensus, and it seems like a wild leap to say that someone’s either asexual or not interested if there’s not sex by 5 dates. I will also say that as a woman, many guys will see you as “easy” for putting out too soon in their eyes, so it seems like a damned if you do, damned if you don’t kind of situation.

Edit: after reading the replies it seems like as a woman, it can be easy to feel like a guy’s just in it for the sex/not in it very seriously if he pushes for it too much/too fast, but as a guy, it can be easy to feel like the girl is not interested/not in it very seriously if the girl’s not having sex after a bit.

62,gsuc51,False,Venting,223,I won’t change myself for a man anymore,dating,"I had a date the other night that really made me think. 
The date itself was fine, at first. I (a 29F) had someone I’ve been chatting with and gone out with twice before (a 30M) over for dinner. I worked hard all day to make things nice before he got there. I put on my favorite new dress, deep cleaned the house, strung up lights in the three seasons room since that’s where we’d be eating, lit my favorite candles from Anthropologie, etc. it was nice! When he got there he said I looked great and so did the house and the food smelled good. Things were off to a decent start. 
Then as we talked more while the food was cooking I started to realize we are VERY different people. Like to the point where we just might not be compatible. 
The difference? Well he talked a lot about wanting to live in a van on a farm and keeping bees and trying to live “zero waste”. That’s all well and good but I almost felt like he was shaming me for not being so extreme with being environmentally conscious. I am conscious of it...I am vegan for ethical and environmental reasons. However, I have my limits. Like I’m not going to live in a van. I worked really hard to get where I am today. I’ve been able to afford myself and above average life. I don’t live extravagantly but I do enjoy quality things. 

For the majority of the date I tried to be open minded and see things from his perspective. After all, I am always trying to better myself and if he can teach me something, I’m all ears. However, as the night wore on things got more personal. He talked about farming...which I know a lot about since I’m a farmers daughter. I grew up on one of the largest produce farms on the east coast and I know what it takes to farm large scale. He seemed to dismiss that and continued to tell me why non-organic farming is essentially the devils work. I came back with some valid arguments to the contrary but realized he was not amenable to entertaining a thought that didn’t align with his opinion so I just started nodding in agreement with him to end the conversation. Then he asked me my stance on monogamy- I said that‘s my goal. He said he’d be “open to monogamy” if that was something I wanted (aka implying that’s not his normal and he’s used to dating multiple ppl at a time). It made me uncomfortable. I know that is ok with a lot of folks but it’s not for me. I told him that. Then he said that was OK and that this is “something new for both of us.” I asked what he meant and he said he’s not used to dating someone so “status quo.” What the hell, right?! I asked him to elaborate and he said “look around. You own this home. You’re successful and definitely not my usual type. It’s intimidating.” I think he meant to flatter me but it felt like sandpaper. To me all I heard was “you’re basic and your life is not alternative enough for me and I’d be doing you a favor by dating you exclusively.” Maybe that’s not how he meant it but that’s what I heard. 
In that moment I knew I could either try and alter myself to threaten his ego less or I could walk away from it. I chose the latter. Also side note- he wanted to hook up but I said no and he suggested a tantric breathing exercise together instead. I’m sorry but WHAT?! I knew in that moment that choosing the latter was the best option for me. 

Ever since the date I’ve been thinking about WHY I’m still dating (although I did just get out of a long term partnership with someone more compatible so it’s not like I’m undatable). I realized I’m just not willing to coddle a man’s ego who I barely even know anymore. I can’t date the men who are so strong in their convictions that they end up personally attacking me for not conforming to their niche way of living. I can’t then change who I am to make THEM feel more comfortable. I can’t have debates with a man who goes into these conversations thinking I’m not going to speak intelligently about a conflicting opinion or who flat out unwilling to hear a conflicting opinion.

You know, the way we are when someone cheats? We get PISSED!! 

It’s not that different from cheating. It leaves you wondering why you weren’t good enough for that person. You feel used, disrespected, insulted and indignant. And IT’S NOT OKAY. 

JUST GROW THE FUCK UP AND SAY HOW YOU FEEL, PEOPLE. IT’S NOT THAT HARD!!!!

And if you’ve been ghosted.. don’t let them get away with it and don’t feel like it’s your fault in some way... GET PISSED!!

EDIT: 

Taking this from one of my comments to clear this up: It’s upsetting that people are misunderstanding what I was trying to say but this is it. Im not trying to control other people like some commenters are saying because here’s the thing: if this guy were to message me and tell me that this wasn’t working for him anymore for one reason or another, I would understand! And I would say so! And sure not everyone would react to that rejection maturely, but like (one commenter) said you can’t control that. You can only do your best to be honest, mature, and respectful yourself. Not everyone is going to do the same, and if they don’t... good riddance. You did your part and you don’t have to have them in your life anymore. But the reality is that most people are going to understand. Most people have experienced rejection before and can handle it, but honesty and communication makes that a lot easier to process.

The person who ghosted me invited me to his cousin’s wedding and said he wanted a relationship in the future. We slept together multiple times, spent multiple full days together and had a ton of fun, and we talked about how surprised we were by how much we ended up liking each other. Then he disappeared. So no, I’m not talking about some Tinder date you never met that stopped messaging you. 

And yes, cheating is a different level of betrayal. I have been cheated on and I know how traumatizing it can be. I’m sorry if that comparison offended some people but what I meant was that being ghosted is degrading in a similar way.

68,gd5lmh,False,Giving Advice,272,A couple things I’ve learned after years of online dating/ dating in general…,dating,"\-Straight up ask guys what they are looking for. Make sure that you guys are on the same page. If he wants something causal and you are looking for a LTR, DO NOT TRY TO MAKE HIM CHANGE HIS MIND. You deserve someone who is looking for the same think as you

\-If a guy is not putting effort in the conversation chances are he is not that interested in you

\-People will come up with lame excuses to hide their bad behavior....""I don't believe in labels."" During the first months of dating take these as a potential red flag

\-During the first months of dating never take his words too seriously. ""I see a future together..."" Wait until the honeymoon phase has faded away to understand his true intentions.

\-When you go on a first date, have zero expectations, even if you matched with the CEO of this Tech company. Some people are very different in person or hide their true personality over a ""nice guy"" facade. Tell yourself that you are just gonna enjoy the evening with some cool company.

\-Ask deep questions that go beyond superficial stuff as hobbies and music

\-Actions speak louder than words

\-Discuss stuff over FaceTime or in-person. Avoid disagreement over text. Some people are amazing writers that make you believe that they are willing to change.

\-The moment you feel that he is not putting effort into the relationship, confront him. If he doesn’t change… END IT. You deserve something better

\-Being someone’s gf is more than a title. Ask yourself, does he actually treats me like a SO?

\-Don’t come up with weird theories of why he is acting weird. ""Maybe he hasn’t called me cause he is stressed."" If someone is truly interested in you, they’ll take the time (This is true 90% of the time)…believe me

\-Never change your boundaries for a SO, if you are not ok with kissing on the first day don’t do it. Players seem to smell when people are willing to break their boundaries for love and they’ll often take advantage of you.

\-Successful career doesn’t indicate emotional maturity 

\-If you are looking for something meaningful don’t sleep with them right away. See if they are willing to get to known you 

\-Watch out for guys who often compare with their ex most of the times this indicates that they haven’t gotten over her

\- Don’t express your insecurities early on 
Is he ten times hotter than you? Is he your first bf? Do you feel that you are not attractive? 
If he asked you out on a date is because he finds you attractive. Players can smell insecurities, you are way more than just a pretty face :)

\- Ask yourself am I in love with the guy or am in love with the idea of being in love? 

\- Have a clear idea what you want but don’t got out of your way to accomplish it. Let’s say that you want a relationship, try to meet people and see if thing workout but don’t try to force it 

\- During the first months of dating take things slow. Don’t go out of your way to make him happy.

Some days, I’m happy with being single and enjoy the time to myself but on days like today, I feel completely miserable knowing that I am worthy of love but can’t have it. All I have ever wanted ever since I was a little girl was to love someone and be loved in return. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and was an amazing girlfriend to my ex but he wasnt to me; not even close. I’m just so depressed with how awful most of the guys I’ve been with are. I’m torn between believing dating is hopeless, yet I remain hopeful that I’ll meet the right person and keep this idealized vision of the man I want in my head and tell myself that he exists. All I think about lately is this man of my dreams whom I’ve never met. It just hurts to not have that right now when I know I am more than enough.

Other days, I just want nothing to do with men and constantly lurk on this sub for hours at a time. It’s like I’m trying to convince myself that I don’t want a man, when truthfully, I do. Either the guy I want is super attractive and a jerk, semi-attractive but a player, or average with mental illnesses (my ex-anger issues and violent tendencies). Probably dramatic, but these have been my personal experiences. Maybe part of it too is that I was with a toxic person for so many years and I just want someone who’s actually good for me.

What I learned is, if someone says this to you, I need to take it at face value. There is one of two reasons why someone would say that. The first reason is that they are only looking for something physical and they know that if you have repeat “hang outs,” the other party has a higher chance of catching feelings. They want to prevent that conversation in the future about defining the relationship and they don’t want to be the bad guy. They can say “I told you from the start I didn’t want a relationship.”
 
The second reason why someone would say this is because they are not interested in a relationship with you. What this means is, they don’t see you as a match. They would be interested in a relationship but you don’t have the qualities they want. Don’t take it to heart because that just means this wasn’t the right pairing.

I have a high sex drive, and while I haven't been in a proper relationship for 5 years I somehow managed to have longer dating phases or FWBs, so at least I got some quite regularly. Now my last 9 months thing fizzled out in December, and since then it's been dry. I hardly get to know new interesting people where I am, and I suck at OLD. So I had ONE date this year, resulting in nothing as the guy started seeing someone else (no hard feelings).
A few weeks ago I adopted a cat. I got one from a family who couldn't afford keeping her, she hasn't been chipped or fixed. And now that poor thing went into heat and is crying for sex. She is crawling through the flat holding her butt up hoping some male cat comes along and notices her. She's longing for affection and making such desperate noises. This is exactly how I feel inside. 
Lucky her, she's getting spayed next week and won't care anymore. I will have to continue this lonely life.

I was bringing some groceries home and I saw her standing next to me at the crosswalk. I kept glancing at her, and when our paths diverged, I noticed she and her friend went over and sat on a bench in the park.

As I was walking home, I couldn't stop thinking of her. She was stunning, and I wanted to ask her out. I felt terrible that I hadn't though, thinking I had missed my chance. I usually resign myself to online dating for fear of bothering random people in person who probably are not interested or available. 

I got home, put down my groceries, and decided I had to man up and do it.  As I started running back to the park, I felt a sinking in my stomach, I became a little light headed and my heart was nearly racing. I was terrified of the rejection I thought may be coming, but I kept going.

As I made my way into the park, I saw her still sitting there, I was lucky they hadn't left yet. I approached, told her that after seeing her I couldn't get her out of my head, and that I couldn't live with myself if I didn't come back to ask her out. She smiled giggled slightly, and looked away.

I stood there for a few more seconds, asked her if that ment no, and she shook her head confirming that she wasn't interested. I then apologized for bothering her and left.

As I walked away, I felt better, a lot better, much better than if I never asked her out in the first place. The rejection wasn't bad at all, only the the fear of it. I felt glad that I took the shot, and even though I missed, I would do it again. 

For years I have only stuck to the dating apps, thinking that was how it was done these days (I never see other people ask random people out in public), yet never having much success. Online you don't have the immediate response to your proposal and people rarely outright reject you. You never know who actually swipes left on you. Thus, you don't get that fear of rejection.

Guy #1 dated me for 5 months and then told me he’d been seeing someone else the whole time. Guy #2 dated me for a few months, slept with me, then ghosted me. This was the first time I’d started dating since my only long-term relationship a couple of years earlier; a guy whom I was with for 5 years that cheated on me multiple times (I’m aware that I sound very negative and bitter by this point, but please bare with).

So back to the present day. I met this new guy about a month ago, guy #3. We went on a few dates and everything was going seemingly well. I went in with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked him. The only thing was, he was incredibly strange. He texted me after our first date to say how much he enjoyed it and that he’d love to see me again. He puts in equal effort to arrange dates that we’ll both enjoy. He texts me every day to find out about my day. He always replies to my messages. He never avoids the hard questions and he’s very open with me. He takes a lot of interest in finding out more about me, the way I think, the things I love, the things I don’t love. He really makes an effort and appreciates the effort I make. It’s all just very, very strange. Right?

WRONG. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. I have wasted so much time waiting around for assholes that I didn’t know what it should actually be like when you are dating someone. I got so used to being ignored, being left on read, going out of my way to make an effort, only to get none in return, feeling annoying rather than wanted, getting dishonest communication or none at all, being made to feel like I wasn’t good enough and that I had to earn the time of others. I was so used to it that I had myself convinced that this was normal. That by speaking up and saying how it upset me, I was being crazy and expecting too much. All of those monumental red flags had become normal to me and instead were not flags at all.

But this...THIS is what it should be like. When someone is genuine and they really do care about you, they don’t do all those things. You won’t have to wonder. You won’t have to feel like you’re not enough for them, that you have to convince them to be with you. I know this may all be nothing short of a platitude but seriously....I feel like after meeting this guy, I have just woken the fuck up.

I have been on a few tinder dates and the girls really were lovely but there was just one thing... In the local supermarket works an absolute gorgeous girl who I've had my eye on ever since I first seen her. She is 100% waaaaay out of my league. The conversations at the checkout we have is amazing and everything just flows naturally compared too anyone else I had been on dates with. Therefore it didn't make me having enough interest into trying too find a partner out of the other girls. All I wanted was this checkout girl! 

I didn't know anything about her personal life (if she had a boyfriend)ect...  so I was pretty nervous about what I did next. Chancing my arm I wrote my name and number on a piece of paper and then proceeded too enter the supermarket not even knowing if she'd be working or not. I grabbed my food and sure enough there she was. I could feel my face going red and the nervs proper kicked in. I was thinking too myself ""do I go ahead with this or not"" but hell what have I got too loose? She finishes serving her customer. Turns too me with her usual gorgeous smile and we go about our conversations like we do most days. At this point just as I am about too pay another customer comes along starts unloading his shopping. This makes me even more nervous knowing that this dude is gonna see what I am about too do.

I said ""*her name* I really enjoy coming into the shop and seeing you. I feel like you are such a lovely genuinely nice person. You are absolutely gorgeous and I would love it if you would like too have a drink with me sometime?"" I could tell by the smile on her face that I had made her day.

89,gx3hk6,False,Question,175,How do you not get attached so quickly when dating?,dating,"Sometimes when I am starting to talk to someone and we click, I notice myself getting really excited and begin painting a future together. I think about dates, first kisses, what the sex will be like, meeting each other’s friends, etc. I just go down a rabbit hole of wander. This is always of course unbeknownst to the other party and I always keep my cool as much as I can around them but that doesn’t go to say that I don’t still have these thoughts or talk to my best friend about it.

9 times out of 10 things never pan out with the guy like I anticipated and I always get my hopes up. Even after going through this cycle many times, it seems to always happen, even knowing it very likely may happen again, and I still don’t know how to not get giddy when it seems like a guy is really into me and I start wondering if I finally found the one.

It’s just so disappointing and discouraging to feel so certain that it’s going to work out with someone only for it to go south.

To those of you who have experienced this, how do you prevent this from happening and keep your cool?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gx3hk6/how_do_you_not_get_attached_so_quickly_when_dating/,1082,"Heyyyy, what’s up!!

So I had this same issue 10 months ago. It took 10 full months to resolve as well haha. So I had an abusive 2 year relationship, couldn’t leave at all, I tried. Once he got jumped and robbed and left to move across the country. Once that was out of the life. I had such bad codependency issues, Jesus it was hard to deal with. I came up with this plan with me and my own widdle brain. This might not work for everyone but I needed to move on and grow up. I was never forced myself to do this, it was just an urge that could be easily resolved and a taste of the real world which I needed. I would go out and hook up with like 1 guy a month or whenever I felt like it. In the beginning I didn’t understand that guys in college don’t want to date and you will get cut off at some point. At first when I hooked up with this guy and he cut me off a 1 month later I was like heart broken tbh, it wasn’t a real relationship but yea. Second time, same thing, I had the general idea that it would happen like last time, I asked him clarifying questions about what will happen next and it sounded like bullshit so after 2 weeks of talking I left him on read. It’s LIBERATING, I felt dumb even expecting something out of it but it’s ok, I didn’t know. It’s ok to cut people off with no explanation, i have become a lot less forgiving for people who do messed up stuff, but I have become more understanding about other things as well. Third and final for now! I 100% knew I couldn’t catch feelings anymore for anyone. It just never worked. No one wants to date me. I started this FWB with this guy I knew from mutual friends. I knew it wouldn’t go anywhere and it was ok, he was really cute but he was not an ideal boyfriend for me  he worked full time at a grocery store and tbh he was judgmental about things I did or would do and I would lightly joke about how my achievements are not something he can judge. I wouldn’t rub it in his face but I would say ____ is working out for me just fine. I learned not to take anything personal from people who don’t actually care about you. Everyone will say what they want and they will want you to believe what they tell you. Don’t let other peoples thoughts and opinions get to you. You NEED to know how you feel and understand that you know what you need to do to feel better, it could be crying, driving around, running. Everyone has their own outlets, as long as it is safe and has good intentions and you’re confident then I said go for it. When I was hooking up with people. I knew everyone would not recommend it because they care about me, as you can tell I did it anyways and it has really shaped me and grow into who I really wanted to be. But the fact that my friends were looking out for me made it feel a little better. Now, I don’t care if I get rejected by men. I just know now not to let anyone use me for sex or anything unless I WANT IT. ",2020-06-05 12:18:42

I (27M) went on a date with someone I met on Hinge at the beginning of December and it was probably the best date I've ever had. We had donuts, went bowling, and topped it all off with soul food. At the end I asked to walk her home and she agreed. During the walk we were asking each other arbitrary questions the whole way up until we got to her place where before we parted I asked ""So... last question of the night.."". She then said ""Uh-oh"" and I started to panic a little bit and said ""Oh man, by your answer that tells me I maybe shouldn't ask it!"" and she said ""No, it's because I already know the question!"". I was a little taken a back but simple responded ""Oh? Well... what's the answer then?"" and she then grabbed my coat and kissed me. The air was cold and still, and when we were done her ears were red. It was perhaps the most romantic thing I've experienced in a long time.

I just read that and it hit home. Thought I'd share it.

I just recently dated someone who simply wasn't ready to get involved with *anyone* because of a recent breakup. 

I had (or if I'm honest still have to some degree) a hard time dealing with the fact that timing just wasn't in our favor because we really clicked and I was so sad over the fact that it just wasn't meant to be.

But the thing is... Sometimes things just can't work out.

No matter how good you two would be together, how much you click, how much chemistry you have with each other, how attracted you are to each other, how well you fit together...

Sometimes it's just not meant to be because your realities just don't match up. For reasons unknown.

It's nobody's fault really. It's not that you're not good enough. It's not that you did or say something wrong. Sometimes timings a bitch. Sometimes the other person isn't in the right emotional state. Sometimes their circumstances get in the way. Whatever.

And in that moment your self respect has to be stronger than your feelings.

Don't beg. Don't discuss it. Don't force yourself back into their lives. Don't argue.

They probably made a healthy decision for themselves. Even if you can't wrap your head around it. Most of the time it's probably not an easy decision for them either. But it's probably a healthy one for you too. Whether you know it or not, you probably wouldn't want to be involved with them while whatevers going on, that prevents you from being with them, is going on, anyway.

We’ll call him Jacob. I’ve texted and talked on the phone with Jacob over the course of 2 weeks or so. He seemed sweet and pretty fun. We finally found the time to set up a date. His use of the word date came as a surprise to me, because I dunno, I’ve been single a long time and I’m just not used to men actually looking for something other than sex. 

It took me about 3 hours to get ready. Yes, excessive. But, I like to go all out when I’m happy or feel like I’m on track. I felt very confident in my appearance, but I wouldn’t say I was looking for negative attention. Not that that even matters. 

First off, I pull into the restaurant, get out of my car, and BOOM. There he is. It struck me as creepy. I didn’t tell him what I drive. Second, I find myself feeling awful because I’ve interacted with this dude for weeks, we’ve sent multiple Snapchats back and forth and... I am not attracted to his real life self. I can’t put my finger on what was different? 

Anyhow, we go in and get seated and he immediately wants to talk about man thing. Cars mostly. That’s fine and all but I had no idea what he was saying. He didn’t seem like the type of person that bothers to explain things, he just likes to talk. Maybe he was nervous. 

As the date goes on, he says various things that just aren’t attractive. He made jokes about jerking off and sex. Just things that generally tend to be an immediate turn off for me. Then, back to hot wiring cars. I think I got whiplash...

He also says that he is recently divorced. So recently, that he signed papers last week. That to me seemed a little swift to be moving back into things. He proceeds to ask me if we can go sit in my car after dinner just to talk more. I don’t know why all my internal sirens started blaring but I instantly felt uneasy. I kinda swept the question under the rug and deferred to a new subject. 

Dinner is done (and I feel horribly relieved that it’s almost over) so I ask if he’s ready to go because I’m beginning to feel the effects of a migraine. At this point, we go outside and we’re standing by my car. He brings up the same question he had earlier and I tried to push it off, saying my car was really dirty. He was insistent that he didn’t care. 

Now, I start getting a little bit defensive... I told him I really just wanted to take dating slowly. He said he respected that, but was obviously very disappointed. He then says he hasn’t had sex since Thanksgiving. 

Insert meme of crazy haired white lemur raising its hands like ‘what the fuck?’ It’s really not my problem... 
I said my head was hurting and it was time for me to be in bed anyways. 

“Well I guess I’m gonna go beat one out in my truck real quick.” All I could reply was oh my god... 

He asked for a kiss and I straight up said no. He kinda got a little louder in tone asking why not. All I could get out was “that’s not really my thing.” So he asks for a hug. To appease him and go home, I let him have a hug, he did buy me dinner after all. 

Pulling back, he says “see, I didn’t try to touch your butt or be inappropriate.” 

I said “do you want a goddamn gold star?” and I got in my car and left.

It's like this balancing act. Well, before the balancing act it's trying to find someone you share some kind of interest in, be it physical or emotional attraction. If you're lucky, both.

Then you gotta be in the right PLACE at the right TIME...

K, then you like each other. You hang out. Then you suppress emotions so you don't scare the other off, so you overthink. ""They haven't responded yet, fuck are they ghosting me?"" ""They're probably just sleeping"" ""If you don't stop thinking about them you're gonna jinx it"" ""Did I jinx it"" ""Oh wait, everything's chill"" ""I just hung out with them it's fine"" ""I like them but I can't tell them because it'll freak 'em out"" ""The sex was AMAZING"" 

Or maybe you don't like them. Then it's... shit, maybe I just don't like them because they're not my ""type"" so, I should consider them. Broaden my horizons. I like their flaws, I can do this. Then you end up leading them on. You never liked them. Wasted time.

I've got the other side of that though, I'm honest and they retaliate and keep trying thinking they can sway me. Or on the other side of the coin, they're honest with me and then change their mind, then it's a whole head fuck.\*

It's insanity. I just want to skip that whole annoying ""getting to know each other through texting because it's 2019"" and the whole ""balancing act"" and the whole wasting each other's time by not being up front... to that comfortable stage.

Im a 27 year old male, have only been in about 1.5 real relationships and a couple of young heartbreaks/unrequited love situations.

I found myself reading the initial messages between myself and the first girl i “loved” when i was 18 years old. Classic case of became best friends, had way too many feelings, we couldn’t date for a variety of reasons (religions, family, etc). Eventually I couldn’t handle being just friends and it blew up.

But reading the messages just left me with a huge void for a couple of reasons. 1. The idealistic view I had of love and relationships at that age that has seemingly been destroyed by breakups and failures and heartbreak and aging. I understand that’s a part of growing up and it is normal to view romance and relationships different at 27 versus 18, but it leaves me with a bad feeling nonetheless. 2. I miss how innocent it was. How pure it was. There was no pretense or alternative interpreted meaning behind our conversations. There was no pressure.

Since that time, among other things, I have app dated a lot. Like >60 first dates a lot. And this has seemingly beaten down the aspects that made me so hopeful and joyful about love and relationships to begin with. It has become so formulaic, even when it is moderately successful. The dates are grossly similar, the conversations blur together. Always preparing to be ghosted at any given moment. Always prepared to throw copious amounts of money on a date with someone I may very well never see at again. And at its best, it just becomes this pattern of going on a few dates, before feeling pressured that its time for intimacy/physical intimacy or to decide if this relationship is going anywhere.

104,hl3oss,False,I Need Advice,578,Girls ends it with me after I bring up concerns over her never offering to pay,dating,"Did I dodge a bullet here?

I went on 3 dates with a girl who never once offered to pay for anything. I kind of gave her a pass on the first 2 since she drove 25 minutes ( I paid her to park since there is no street parking) to come see me and we always had a great time. I absolutely would not have let her pay but I still think she should have at least made an offer, but I was not too worried about it. On the third date, we went somewhere closer to her that she picked. We agreed on just drinks but shortly before the date, she told me she was hungry and she ended up ordering food while I ate dinner beforehand but got something small so she didn't feel weird.

We had a great time again but does not offer to contribute and then a few minutes later makes a comment about how I don't pay for her ubers to and from dates, while other guys she had gone out with did. She claims it was a joke but the timing was pretty poor so I was annoyed and the date ended pretty awkwardly shortly after.

The next day I let her know that I was pretty insulted by her comment because it's important to me that a girl offers to at least do something as little as pay for a round of drinks over the course of 3 dates, so to make a comment like that really hit a nerve. I told her I would not have even let her pay at this point, but the offer is a nice gesture that goes a long way with me and is very reassuring to me that I’m not being used as a meal ticket.

She then basically says ""I'm sorry you feel that way about me offering to buy a round of drinks but I don't really have much else to say"" and also makes a comment about this situation being immature and tells me that she'd like to end things.

I’m especially talking someone who initiated/showed interest in you first, you liked them back, and they either lost interest or got with someone else (and lost interest after getting with that someone else).  Especially in cases of either almost dating or dating briefly.   And with the former especially, without properly dating at all, it’s painful because you go from clicking to almost being strangers.  There was a potential for a connection that didn’t come to fruition-even when you try staying friends you guys are now at ground zero since you only barely got to know each other.  You’re stuck with all these feelings to the point that it seems too good to be true that this person was interested in you a while back, despite them having to pursue you/even if they were quite keen on you back then.

When you're young, it's easy to understand life trajectory that makes you desirable through accomplishments:

For me it was:

1. Do well in High School, so that you can...
2. Go to College, do well in college so that you can...
3. Get a job (or get a Masters--my path), so that you can
4. Get a better job in the city
5. ??????????????   \[This step is where I am right now\]

Now that I actually have an office job that I enjoy, now what? 

I know I want to meet someone, but it's not a straightforward path. There isn't like a list of steps for me to complete to guarantee that I will find someone.

Don’t even think you can change their minds. It’s such a turn off and it’s obnoxious. 

I had a first date with someone recently, I made it very clear that I was looking to take things slow. I asked him what he was looking for and he said he was looking for a relationship for the long term. Which was great cause that’s what I’m also looking for. He seemed to be totally fine and okay with me wanting to take things slow. He also is aware that I’m still a Virgin and I explained why (basically I had not so great relationships in the past and didn’t feel comfortable sleeping with them, and one had medical issues that got in the way). He seemed to respect that and still wanted to keep seeing me. Well, date one we go back to his place for a movie and he tries mauling me. Very very touchy feely, and I had to tell him to stop. He apologized, said he hoped he wasn’t coming on too strong, blah blah. Well I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and we went out again the next day. Rinse and repeat. Same shit, but even more so. Told him to chill, he apologized and then when he dropped me off at home I got a lengthy text about him coming off too strong again and that he just can’t help it because he found me to be really attractive and blamed it on his “animal instincts” but said if it happens again I can “put him in his place” and he’ll stop again. And I’m thinking, why do I have to constantly tell him to stop when I’ve already told him multiple times to stop, and when I already made it clear before we met up that I’m not looking to rush things?! Well, 2 days later and it’s date 3. Saaammmeee shit. However outside of that our dates were amazing! But now he’s not responding to me anymore and when he dropped me off last time I saw him I can just tell that there was something wrong. I got a feeling. And now, just no responses. 

So I’m assuming all the nice and sweet stuff he said to me throughout the entire time we were talking was just bullshit and he just wanted to low key try to get me to change my mind about the physical stuff cause he was a horny horn dog. And when he realized after 3 dates that it wasn’t happening, he gave up??? IT WAS 3 DATES! Holy moly. Cause everything else was fine. So I’m baffled if that wasn’t the reason for his ghosting. 

So really. If someone says they wanna take things slow, believe them. If casual sex is all you want then go for someone who actually wants casual sex. and not someone who’s also a damn Virgin if you can’t wait more 6 days lol. 

Keep in mind this guy acted like he was genuinely interested in me, met my mom, I met his parents, constantly texting me, wanted to hangout all the time, made plans for the near future once things open up again, told me I made him really happy, was always excited to see me or hear from me... and for what???

110,f21nud,False,Giving Advice,310,10 Lessons Learned from Dating Over a Year (Male Perspective),dating,"Hello all, decided to give the male perspective for dating and how to shift through toxicity as a heterosexual guy. (Niceguys, this may help you lol)

&#x200B;

**1.) Don't send millions of messages.** Please don't do this. Aside from looking desperate, when you send too many messages at one time, you actually race through the conversation. It makes it hard to stay on topic and ruins the flow of a conversation. It also makes it less likely she'll actually read everything you wrote.

**2.) Don't be afraid to send more than one message.** This is not a contradiction to **rule 1**. Basically, don't feel like there are strict dating rules you have to follow. If there is a topic you are really interested in and passionate about, don't be afraid to seem excited to talk about certain topics. God forbid you might actually show some personality instead of just looking like a ""cool guy"".

**3.) Don't waste your time with girls that give short replies or act like they don't wanna talk.** If a girl doesn't seem interested in the conversation, just stop. It takes two people to talk.

**4.) Don't let her act like she's cooler than you.** This one is worded a bit funny but all I mean is that don't let her behave like you're always the one that needs to impress her. Most girls actually have ZERO game. That's because it's usually guys that hit on them. This lets them sit back and act like they are above it all sometimes.

**5.) Don't be afraid of silences**. <-- This is something confident people easily pull off. If you're always talking on a date, trust me, the other person notices it. People who are afraid of moments of silence come across as insecure and often times they are. Slow your pace when you talk, give her time to answer questions and when she does answer, don't immediately jump in as soon as she's done. Give her time to elaborate and make her feel like the ownership of the conversation is also on her. This is a major power dynamic when first meeting someone. Similar to **rule 4**, don't feel like you always need to impress her. Let her impress you. (If you're super into the topic then don't be afraid to talk more but as a general rule, slow your pace down and put her in a position where she feels like she needs to speak.)

**6.) How does she behave? How does she treat you and others around her?** One of the best indicators of a person's character is how they treat people they don't care about or that can't do anything for them. If she's inconsiderate when you first meet, then she's inconsiderate. That's not going to get better. (Do not mistake ppl being uninterested with inconsideration. Inconsideration is when you two are dating or if you two know each other. Uninterested is when she ain't interested in dating you or when you're just a guy in her DMs. Both cases, you should walk away.)

**7.) Know what you're looking for.** Are you looking for a relationship or sex? We all have our own dating rules, so if you're looking for a relationship, pay attention to how she presents herself to the world and her boundaries. No offense ladies, but if a girl gets sexual with me immediately, that's a strike against her as far as a relationship goes. I've had girls send me nudes within 20 minutes of talking.  If she gets sexual with you right off the bat, you need to decide whether that information would cause problems later on if you decided to date her. This is where **rule** **6** comes into play. If she's really a great person then lots of guys will still consider her gf material.

**8.) Don't put her on a pedestal.** Similar to **rule 4**. It's called a partner, not a boss. If you're always sucking up to her or telling her how amazing she is and how beautiful she is, she won't like you. Flip the tables, what if you had a guy friend always telling you how cool you are and how unworthy he is to be your friend? You'd probably be like yeahhhhh he's a nice guy but he's a suck up. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our friends. It's the same with relationships. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our partners. No one likes a suck up.

**9.) Don't pretend to be something you're not.** It's hard to be yourself with someone you've just met. But it's much easier to avoid pretending to be something you're not. If you like video games or if you hate clubbing (like me), don't be scared that you'll look nerdy. I've had girls who had pictures of them clubbing tell me that they actually didn't really like it that much and they only did it cause there was nothing else to do sometimes. Don't try and look cool by lying about your interests.

**10.) Be a decent human being.** There is a big difference between being nice and being kind. Try and be both if you can but if you are nice to someone don't only be nice hoping to get something out of it. Regardless of what happens, relationships, friendships, strangers, etc, the effort of being a good person even when it's hard is a reward in and of itself. If you let yourself get nasty too many times then eventually you'll just be a nasty person. Actions become habits and habits become part of who you are.

&#x200B;

**Bonus Rule:** I've seen on niceguy videos where they will narrate themselves during texts. Yeah...don't do that.

113,go1i6d,False,Giving Advice,272,My dating journey as an ugly guy: from rough beginnings to decent ends,dating,"As an ugly person, it has been painful but also rewarding to accept my place.

It was challenging to accept the truth and consequences of my appearance.  Society places enormous emphasis on appearances.  People everywhere will judge you and treat you negatively based on appearance, no matter how intelligent/educated/nice they believe themselves to be.  So it can be very depressing to open your eyes and see how many people discriminate against you (usually just in subtle ways, thankfully).

The reality of my ugliness dawned on me very slowly.  I noticed how my attractive friends were treated better than me in public-- random people would commonly make friendly eye contact with them or even smile at them, which has never happened for me.  I would be excluded from certain conversations or events.  I saw myself ageing much more harshly than other guys my age.  I noticed that I was usually the least attractive person in group photos.  Needless to say, I struggled to find girls to date, or even talk to.  Eventually, it was no longer possible to delude myself.

I also really struggled with the idea that, even though I'm ugly, maybe I can still find an attractive mate.  I got over that through numerous painful dating experiences and by observing how couples usually have similar levels of attractiveness.  I have learned that, if you want to ""date up"", there is a very low ceiling on ""up"", and that ceiling can only be broken if you allow yourself to be exploited in some way (e.g. maybe they want your money or status, or maybe they are just a psycho trying to hurt you).

Once I got past these painful truths, a deeper truth also dawned on me: that there are girls who, just like me, are straight and also tired of getting mistreated based on appearances.  Knowing that, I found it much easier to find high-potential mates and treat them kindly.  I knew I could treat them the way I wanted to be treated, and that they would appreciate it.  By focusing on that mantra, I was able to not only avoid painful interactions, but also make new friends, enjoy the company of women on casual dates, and eventually, I found a romantic relationship.

And it goes so well that both people want to go on a second date. And a third date. And a fourth date. And they are both so equally into each other, that they become an official couple. And then they get to further know each other and build mutual trust and affection. And eventually they decide that they are so compatible that they want to spend their lives together. 

From my experience in dating, I sometimes get existential about how its even possible that anyone finds love and finds their person in a sea of people who are not into you, ghost, are emotionally unavailable, have mixed signals or string you along, then leave.

From the beginning he didn't give a damn. So thats why I didn't give this guy a 2nd chance. First impressions mean everything for sure. I don't need another version of my ex.

I joined a knitting group to get some practice with casual conversation, and find a group with which to work on my hobby.  After that, I wanted to find more social contact, but I also realized that someday I might want to start a family.  If I don't start now, I might never be ready...  So I got on OLD.

Over the next 4 months i was able to get about 4 first dates.  The first one was nice, but I was a little awkward.  The second one I really liked, but she wasn't into me; we're still friends though and occasionally text about crafting projects.  The third one went fine, but she decided to cut off contact.

Now for number 4.  As a man, the optimum strategy on OLD is to swipe right on everyone without looking, and filter later.  The yield is so small.  But we all know that occasionally, someone catches your eye.  You look at her pictures, read her bio, then realize that it would never happen, then you go back to swiping right.  In online dating, hope should be general, not specific.  To my surprise, someone who I had paused on ended up liking me back.  She(25f) seemed really enthusiastic and the text convo in the app was easy.  She complied when I suggest we move to phone text and then we scheduled a first date.  She was even more amazing in person.  She is as smart as anyone I've ever met (with a masters degree in a scientific field), super well versed in music history, had a sense of humour similar to mine, and she was very pretty.  We had lunch, walked around town, then found a nice place to sit and chat.  We lost track of time and ended up racking up over 6 hours.  Since then we texted pretty much every day, and had in person dates every other week (we live across town and are both fairly busy). Yesterday we had date 4, and we planned this to be a big one.  We decided to get dressed up and go to the symphony and get a nice dinner beforehand.  After dinner we start walking to the operahouse, but before we get to far, I pull out the jokes.

""I have something for you.  Give me your hand.""  She puts her hand on mine and I put a lime on hers. She looks confused.  I say, “That was just an excuse to hold your hand.”  She laughs.  I then say “That was my pick up lime.”  She then offers me her hand as we walk to the operahouse.

After the show we go back to my car, and i offer to drive her to her car, parked a few blocks away.  That is when we had the talk.  We just talk for like an hour about various things...  Starting with establishing that we want to be official.  After a nice conversation, we drive over to her car.  I get out to give her a hug goodnight... but somehow we just can't say goodbye.  We end up standing there in the freezing cold for another hour just because saying goodbye is so hard.  I eventually have to just say that if we have anything else to say, hopefully we'll have many more nights to say it.  We then have a very intense hug.  There were times over the past month where I knew she was almost perfect for me on paper, but I wasn't sure how much I viscerally emotionally wanted this.  Durring that hug I knew the spark was there.

I don't know how long things will last.  I don't know what happens now.  I will hope for the best and try what i can to make the best happen.  Here is what I do know.  I'm fat, I'm ugly, I was a lost cause.  [If i can find someone, anyone can.](https://i.imgur.com/W3JS9Gq.jpg) Keep hope alive.

120,geq4eo,False,I Need Advice,331,"""You're perfect. You treat me so well, and I am always dying laughing, always looking forward to seeing you, but there is no spark.""",dating,"""You're perfect. You treat me so well, and I am always dying laughing, always looking forward to seeing you, but there is no spark.""

This is a post I just need to make to vent and get some advice here. Sorry for the ramble, I'll try to keep it short. I met this girl through work, she reached out to me because we had a work related phone convo and she felt I was special. We instantly hit it off, talked over text and the phone like crazy all day. We eventually met in person for the first time and had an amazing time. We didn't have sex but I went down on her and honestly gave her one of the most intense O's i've ever seen someone have, not to toot my own horn. But I felt pretty good. We cuddled the rest of the night before I had to go home. We live over an hour apart. All along the while, she makes me laugh and feel great. I honestly thought everything was perfect. I try to be reserved at first but I was getting these ""she may be the one"" feelings even after a week. Maybe the fact she let me eat her out on the first date was a red flag that she was just looking for something more casual.

But this whole time she kept complimenting me, saying how great I was, how she is glad nobody has taken me off the market.. all the things you want to hear from someone who seems like they want a real relationship.

She asked me out on a 2nd date, and well during quarantine there isn't a whole lot to do, so we ended up waiting in line for several hours for some food at a packed drive thru that is always packed and takes hours. She didn't even like the food, but knew I'd never had it before so we went.  We got out of the car and danced together, we sang together, held hands, kissed.. I mean what did I miss here?

Why would someone do all that if they didn't feel anything? -- She starts telling me how she has trust issues and is afraid of being hurt, how she never has had a good relationship and doesn't know how to take care of it, etc... And normally she would just ghost or tell people to fuck off, but she really cares about me. She said she really wanted me to know that she was going through this because she felt I was special.

So I let her have some space while she does that, but she just pulls away.

Wtf mate? I just don't get it. Asked her what was up and we talked on the phone. I asked if there was something I could do to help her through this trust issue and she said it would help if I could tell her how I felt. So I put myself out there and was just honest. Told her I was crazy about her, how I want to keep getting to know her and go out more, how much I enjoy talking with her.  She ends up saying that Everything about me is amazing. That I treat her like a queen, that she is always dying laughing around me, that she always looks forward to hearing from me or seeing me.. But just ""something"" isn't there. Like there is no spark...  But she really feels I am special and cares about me.

So I had to tell her that I just can't really continue like that then and think we shouldnt talk much anymore. She keeps saying she is sorry and we hang up..

I am confused. I know I should just love myself and not care, but everything seemed perfect. I am normally pretty good at spotting my mistakes, or seeing signs they aren't interested.. But she gave so many she was. From all the affection she was giving, to playing love songs in the car while we waited, to touching me, kissing me, grabbing my hand to hold. Was I too nice? I wasn't unconfident, clingy or anything of the like.. Just said sweet things.

I seriously hate dating. I don't know what it is about me that pushes people away, but I am reserved at first and can take a minute to get to know. That doesn't ever seem to create any ""spark"" at all for people and I just am lost. If you suffered through this. Help. I'd be glad to elaborate or answer any questions.

I really like this guy and wanted tonight to go over smoothly. But the catch... after we had slept together, as I was getting dressed, there was a towel on the bed that wasn’t there and saw a smudge of red on my pants I was about to put on. I put two and two together and realized I had my period and had ruined his sheets. He was sweet enough to try to conceal the spot under the towel. I had quietly remarked “I think I ruined your sheets” and he said “oh, are there other spots on the bed?” casually and continued to say “don’t worry about it, it’ll wash right out”. I offered to buy him a set of new sheets and he again told me not to worry and jokingly “it adds color to the room”... I mean, I’m still pretty mortified it happened and will probably buy him sheets anyway but he handled it so well. Thankful there are guys out there that know what to do in these situations.

Spent the whole day talking on video call when at 1.30 in the night, I just happened to check the cab services and one showed nearby. I sent a request, it got accepted and I was on my way. I was so scared and honestly felt my guts shivering for the fear of being stopped by cops.

Reached her place, she wasn't a serial killer(thank god!) and ended up spending the night and the next night at her place. We then moved to my place on Tuesday and have been here since.

It's so much fun having her around, not to mention the fact that we both like cooking so all the free time goes in cooking something delicious (she's a better cook, hands down!).

129,g6upkb,False,Venting,153,"[Rant] Why ""being happy being single"" isn't always a good thing.",dating,"Sorry in advance for this wall of text, quarantine has just lead me to doing a lot of self-reflection and introspection on things. 

I've spent a lot of time recently reading this subreddit and a few others. The same advice seems to come up quite a bit when people talk about having difficulties getting dates, forming relationships, etc: Work on yourself. Improve yourself. Be happy with yourself single or you won't be happy in a relationship. Be the person you'd want to date. 

Firstly, I'd just like to say that in general this IS very good advice. We should always be looking to improve ourselves as people. Not necessarily just for the sake of dating/meeting a partner, but just to make our lives better as a whole. 

But there's something else I'd like to address here. 

There seems to be a prevailing attitude in quite a few dating advice forums that essentially boils down to ""be okay with being single"". At face value this seems like a good approach; if you're not happy being on your own, why drag another person down with you? But I'd like to make a potential counter-argument to this, or at least partly.

There seems to be two possible perspectives here:

1) Be happy with yourself as a person, while you just so happen to be single.

2) Be happy being single, as a status or condition of your life.

The first one is, in my opinion, very solid advice. And in general I'd say that in most areas of my life I am very happy with how things are going. I've got a stable job, solid group of friends, in good shape, do things that make me happy and improve myself as a person, you get the idea. 

However, the second one can be...dangerous, to put it one way.

I'm a 27 year old guy, and have never had a girlfriend in my life. Never had sex, never kissed anyone, blah blah you've heard this story before. When I was younger it wasn't that big of a deal, really. There was so much other stuff happening in life that dating and relationships were pretty much on the back burner. But going into college, and after graduating, I started realizing something might be wrong. All my friends and peers were in dedicated long-term relationships, or were at least having success when it came to casual dating. I was the odd man out. So I decided to make some changes and did my research. That lead to a commitment to self-improvement, which I'm still pursuing to this day. At first things seemed to be looking up; my confidence improved, I felt much better about myself as a person, and generally had a better outlook on life.

But the one area that remained the same was my romantic/dating life, or lack thereof. I felt good about myself as a person who just so happened to be single. However, I still wasn't happy with BEING single. 

My friends tried to help, and a lot of them took the approach of telling me how great being single is. Not having to worry about arguments/relationship troubles/etc. But to me that always felt like a bit of a cop-out answer. Imagine telling someone who was dying of thirst ""Oh, water? Yeah it's okay I guess, but it's not *that* great."" 

That lack of dating success started bleeding into other areas of my life. What confidence I'd built up pretty much vanished after I was rejected a number of times, and still hasn't come back. It also feels like I'm the verge of having depressive episodes almost every day. I tried to think of other areas that needed to be improved, that could possibly be leading to this back-track in the progress I'd made. But it always came back to my perpetual state of being alone. 

It feels like a constant feedback loop. I can't seem to make any progress when it comes to dating, which means that there must be something wrong with me. There's something wrong with me, which means I won't have any success trying to date/form relationships. This also contributes to a concern that at this point it's too late for me, that nobody will want to go out with a 27 year old who's never had a girlfriend in his life. From an outside perspective, it's easy to see how someone might think there's some serious underlying issues there that would explain this lack of experience.

What I'm trying to say (in an admittedly very verbose way) is this: The advice of ""be happy being single"" isn't always great, at least in the long term. While I like myself as a person who's single, the idea of being alone for the rest of my life is terrifying and feeds back into some of the negative self-talk that has sprouted from a lack of romantic experiences. I don't want to be single; I want to be able to form healthy relationships like everyone else, to have that intimacy and trust with another person but have never been able to experience so far. It feels like I've been missing out on one of the most rewarding things life has to offer, and everyone says ""oh, just be okay with it!"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/g6upkb/rant_why_being_happy_being_single_isnt_always_a/,887,[removed] ,2020-04-23 20:53:27

They aren’t afraid of being public with you, they don’t look at every other girl and make comments about their bodies. They don’t take complete advantage of you. They don’t call you whipped if you do something nice like make breakfast. It’s not all about sex, you have nights where you just talk for hours and hours. Were I don’t feel used.

Edit: okay, I (24F) didn’t expect this to blow up like this at all, holy shit. Umm, I’ll give more background? So a skimmed comments because there’s... a lot... lol. And a lot are saying therapy, I did go to therapy but it was for my childhood trauma and the experience wasn’t my favorite so I left. Now, I saw one person talk about abandonment issues, I do have those but I don’t really have a fear of being left behind. I’ve never had someone that I’ve noticed make an impact after leaving, well maybe my dad but I’d rather be with my mom (as much of a “mom” as she is) than an alcoholic drug addict around me as an example to look up to. I just don’t know what a good relationship looks like is my problem. I’ve only been in two relationships, one I was left at a bar in the worst part of downtown because the “really nice guy” flipped out all of the sudden claiming I was getting him drunk (he bought a bottle of vodka, I drank a cup of rum and coke- I’m not a big drinker and he was, that’s not my fault). Now the one I’m one foot in one foot out is the one that’s really messed me up for good. I tried leaving when I noticed he was changing, after becoming this person he molded himself into so I would fall for him because he was “what I was looking for”, but this guy. This is not someone that you can run from. He buys new phone numbers, gets new social media accounts, puts numbers under different numbers- I mean you can only imagine what someone going to school for cybersecurity can do. Anyways, after two attempts to get away from him he took it as a chance to trap me. Now, with my mental health issues (major chronic depression, anxiety and panic disorder, etc etc the fun list goes on) cause me to be safer to not be on birth control. So, I don’t take it- and that’s a very very well known fact I make clear if they show interest. Well, after being together for two and a half months he got tired of me trying to leave and “getting mad at him.” Now I’m stuck with him in some way for 18 years and 5 months. Now it’s not only manipulation to get me back, now it’s him threatening lawyers, to take my baby, etc etc etc because that I can’t run from.

We text in the morning and throughout the day and play video games, watch Haunting of Hill House on Netflix, and chat in the evenings. We spend hours video chatting every day often late into the evenings. I’ve never met someone who is such a perfect match.

We have the same beliefs and values, we both value communication and discussion, and we both find each other really considerate and caring. But we also have so much in common! We have similar food tastes, enjoy each other’s taste in music, both enjoy PC gaming, and cuddles and both of our favorite stores are the dollar store. The most interesting thing is we both share the exact same birthday just 3 years apart (24M) (21F).

We’ve been really open with each other and we’ve been feeling the exact same way about each other. We are each others type and find the other very attractive. Both of us have been feeling like everything has been going really well and we make the other one happy.

We haven’t seen each other in person yet but we plan on seeing each other on Friday for the first time. We’re both really excited! I think I found the girl of my dreams.

So earlier this week I met up with someone my age from an online dating website. We walked around town, had dinner and a few drinks together. It seemed to be going well, and she’s really amazing and beautiful, but being the skinny, insecure nerd that I am (never been in a relationship, never had sex) I had no idea if she liked me romantically or not.

In a random burst of confidence which happens very rarely to me, as we were laughing and talking together near the end of the evening, I out of the blue asked if I could kiss her. She said yes. Before I could process this, she moved up close to me and we made out for a good few minutes.

She was the first person to kiss me since the beginning of 2011, when I was 22. I’m now 30. No one I had met in the last eight years had made the move on me, and everyone I had asked (which might sound lame to some but I’ve always been cautious) had all gently said no. I started online dating a year and a half ago when I had enough of being alone, but I hadn’t had much success until now. I didn’t tell her how long it had been, I just said after she was the first in a long time. To which she smiled, understood, and kissed me even more.

I feel pretty incredible about it still. We both lead busy lives but I hope we find time soon to see each other again. And, whatever happens, I *really* hope it’s not another eight years until the next time.

143,fbq03l,False,Giving Advice,48,Absence makes the heart grow fonder,dating,"... it shouldn’t leave you guessing and worried.

What I’m saying is that I see so many posts from people who are so damn unsure and worried about the person they’re dating. They make themselves crazy because they’re trying to decipher what the other person is thinking or feeling and worried whether or not they’re into them.

But dating shouldn’t be like that. You should be sure about what you and the other person want.

And to be honest I used to think that being unsure and self conscious was just part of the game and I’d be so self conscious about every text I’d send, every word I’d say, every action I’d take.

But the truth is that if you find someone who gets you and wants to be with you, you won’t have to bend and break to know where you stand with them. I know this isn’t some sort of groundbreaking epiphany I’m sharing but I want to share it nonetheless.

Dating should be fun. You shouldn’t have to overthink every step you take. And simply put you should be able to be yourself and not question every little thing you do or say.

Because in the end... if the person you’re dating leaves you guessing and worrying when you’re not actively with them... you should move on from them. 

A person who wants to be with and cares about you will let you know and let you feel it. They’ll build you up and give you the attention you deserve. They’ll answer your texts in a timely manner, they’ll take you out to dates, they’ll make time for you even when they’re busy, they’ll build you up when you’re down...

They won’t leave you on read for hours, they won’t flake on you, they won’t be unsure about you, they won’t make you question their intentions. 

Basically I feel as if we should all listen to ourselves and our own feelings more. How that person makes you feel when you’re not around them will tell you so much more about how good they are for you than when you’re with them. 

It’s not even what *they’re are doing but so much more what you yourself are feeling*. 

If a person manages to put a smile on your face even though you haven’t seen them for a few days... that’s where it’s at. If they manage to make you feel down and question your own self worth in that time... do yourself a favor and move on.

146,gwaj6l,False,Giving Advice,36,Just remember: it isn’t fair to compare your connection with someone you met recently to someone you know very well,dating,"When I think about meeting new people and they seem boring, I realize I am comparing all the best parts of my former relationship. How can someone I just met, who I barely know or am just getting to know, compare to someone I built a former deep and meaningful relationship with? 

It’s not realistic to expect that right off the bat. It’s easy to hold your ex to a high standard and feel as though no one else will hold up to them, but it’s unrealistic to compare a connection that formed over time and a connection just beginning to develop. I felt like they knew me better than anyone else. That came from spending a LOT of time together. I can’t expect to feel seen and known from people who Ive barely given the chance to get to know me. Comparing, and looking for that instant connection, is not always representative of what your relationship could be. 

I have to constantly keep reminding myself of this. You’ll meet someone else who blows that person out of the water. Very rarely is a real connection formed so instantly. Give people a chance—chemistry can be formed. Don’t compare the best parts of your past to how things are going now. It’s not fair to the other person to have to try and live up to an impossible standard right off the bat. I know this is something I have to work on. Hopefully it’s something that helps you too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwaj6l/just_remember_it_isnt_fair_to_compare_your/,833,"I disagree, to an extent.

My ex and I were painfully incompatible people but did have an incredible amount of chemistry from the get-go. I wanted to find that kind of passion again, but with someone who would be good for me. I didn’t expect to feel as *attached* right away, but I did next a lot of people who didn’t quite do it for me before I found that visceral connection again (not without worrying that I was being too hasty). But waiting for something that felt real was the right choice. This is far and away the best relationship I’ve ever been in. 

Chemistry is generally immediate and felt by both parties. If you don’t feel it, it’s not only ok but healthy to admit it and move on. It’s good to look for a balance of practicality and someone who brings the heat. You’re trying to fall in love, not interview candidates for an office job. ",2020-06-04 04:52:11

Something I've realized is that there seems to be a normalized victim mentality when it comes to dating and I think we need to collectively challenge  this. On this sub I see lots of posts about ""I hate being dragged along"" ""If you don't like me romantically LET ME KNOW so I can move on"" etc and all these posts basically enforce the idea that the power always has to lie in your romantic interest and not in you. Well I realized something recently: Our sole responsibility as individuals is to take care of ourselves and be happy period. It's not to figure out why our partner is withdrawing from us especially if they won't communicate like adults, whether they're interested, whether they're not. In dating situations I've found myself asking more about How they make me feel and whether I like it instead of whether I'm good enough for them and it's been life changing. When I was younger I would pine and wonder about a guy's interest now I only go for guys who are full on after me If I have to guess I'm out. I approach my life in general with an abundance mentality and I've noticed I'm getting more positive male attention this way. I always make it clear what I want and how I want to be treated. If I notice things are changing I ask about it once. After that I dip tf out and move on to the next or stay single, they can explain when they want but I'm out at that point. Don't accept long response times, late night only convos, disrespect, lack of clarity, feeling led on. This is the only soul and body you'll ever have. Why are you allowing anyone to do you the disservice of guessing and pining because they are not brave enough to let you go and are choosing to ghost? Take your power back, let yourself go.

EDIT: This post is not encouraging ""selfishness"" or ""callousness"". It's about integrity and self respect. If you know what's makes you happy then that's is what you should go after. I'm not saying ""Walk away from anything as soon as a little problem arises"". I'm saying notice it, communicate with your partner and both of you meet each other in a good middle. If they cannot work with you then with self respect, walk away.

Otherwise, if she just leaves her response as a simple ""Sorry, I'm busy"" without a follow-up, she's not interested!

Even worse is when she gives you the second response but you then ask her, ""So when are you free?"" This puts her in an extremely uncomfortable situation because it doesn't give her the option to decline unless she says something like ""Oh sorry, I'm never free,"" which she obviously would want to avoid because it's impolite. So then she panics and says, “uhh, I’m not sure,” to avoid explicitly telling you that she doesn’t want to hang out with you, ever. And you are bewildered by her response and think that women are confusing.

To summarize, here is A Handy Guide on How to Ask a Girl Out, Yet Save Face for Both of You If She Isn’t Interested:

Ask the girl the following: “Hey, I was wondering if you’d be free this ______ at ___ pm to get dinner with me?” Be extremely specific! Don’t say, “Are you free in the next decade?” or worse yet, “When are you free?”. It’s much better to say, “Are you free this Saturday at 6:30pm?”.

Option A: She says some variation of “yes”. Wow, that was easy!

Option B: She says, “Sorry, I have five psets and two exams that week, but how about _____? Does that work for you?” Congratulations, she was actually busy but is interested in you! You also gave her the option to decide on a date that works for her, you gentleman you!

Option C: She says, “I’m a bit busy then. Sorry, I don’t think I’ll be able to make it.” Oof, sorry my dude, she wasn’t into you. Do not, under any circumstances, suggest another day. This is because if she was truly interested, SHE’D suggest another date. Wish her the best with her work and go your separate ways.

For everyone out there who’s afraid of rejection (ie, everyone), this is the perfect method, because by suggesting a very specific date and time, there’s a huge chance that she will actually be busy. This means that her response of, “Sorry, I’m busy” will be genuine, but now it gives HER the power to decide on a further course of action. Essentially, you’ve turned the tables and now *she’s* the one asking *you* out! Thus, if she suggests another time, congratulations, a girl just asked you out on a date! If she doesn’t, that’s equivalent to her never having asked you out in the first place, so everything has stayed the same and you have lost nothing.

I hope this helped, and good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/bm84zl/a_handy_guide_on_how_to_ask_a_girl_out_yet_save/,788,two sentences in fuk u u beta bithc ,2019-05-08 17:30:45

ORIGINAL POST:

Take it from someone doing it right now. If you are dating and meeting new people you may get with someone whom you click with either sexually or have fun BUT not  necessarily want a relationship with.  

Not wanting a relationship “right now” only really means “not with you”. 

Yes there are occasions where this isn’t true and the person doesn’t want to be in a relationship period, but most of the times it means they are waiting for someone else (sometimes someone they haven’t met but an archetype different than you). 

The best you can do is not waste your time and move on or accept it will go nowhere and enjoy it.

As for me I am pretty open towards the beginning what type of relationship I see myself having with the other person so there are no confusions.

157,bzpz8u,False,Giving Advice,142,"""You choose who you want to be with"" - Dating advice from my therapist",dating,"I started going to therapy recently and the subject of dating is a usual topic. I just wanted to share what she said because it made me think. Here's what happened.

So I asked her ""How do you meet people nowadays?"" she chuckled a bit and said ""I get that question a lot. Some people are great. They're intelligent, educated, good personality but they just have a hard time meeting people due to the nature of society nowadays (work first over personal life).""

I told her about my exes and 'my perfect boyfriend', I asked her if it was too much to ask for someone like that. She said ""Well, I'm not saying it's impossible but it'll be difficult."" then I said ""Okay, well I think I need to put myself out there more. Put myself in a position to meet this person.""

This is the part that hit me. She responded ""That's no guarantee either. You could go on a dating app and date 10 guys but none of them will be the one. You could go to classes and hobby groups but the chances of meeting someone is like 50/50. Even if you do meet someone you like, there's no guarantee they'll like you back. You can't control them.""

And then her advice was to just focus on things you can control, which is working on yourself.  When I started talking about ""the one"" or ""the one I'll be compatible with"" she was kinda shaking her head and she said ""We just choose who we end up with... so do you want the funny guy who isn't handsome? The handsome guy but is boring? Etc...""

I think what she was trying to say is that no one is going to be perfect and if we hold out for that person it'll be difficult and beyond our control. We're all just imperfect humans and we just choose which other imperfect human to be with.

So from this I'm somewhat changing my mindset about dating.

I know people are busy between jobs, parenting, hobbies and everyday life. But, that doesn’t mean you can’t put ANY
 effort into dating if it’s a priority to you. Sometimes it’s the little things that count! 

For example, connected with one guy via OLD and a month had gone by and still no date. He was always “busy” at work, with his kid, but would be snap chatting him by the pool or out and about lol. Final straw was when we had a date set up (finally) I ask for a time around 10 a.m and his response was “I’ll let you know, I’m school shopping for my kid”. I get a text at 8:30 pm asking if I’m ready. No thanks.

When he has his kid I don’t blow his phone up, and vice versa (I coparent as well). The big difference is we prioritize that time. He sometimes falls asleep on the phone and I think it’s adorable. Last night, before telling me goodnight he apologized for the nights he falls asleep without telling me. *insert big cheesy smile*. Third date is a late dinner which I don’t usually do but I’m compromising due to him getting off work late. (Priority)

170,g091oy,False,Giving Advice,54,Sometimes the most intimate moments are simply not captured.,dating,"Hey guys, I know we live in a world that pays a lot of attention to social media. And I myself have fallen into the horrible spiral of comparing my relationship to some of the ones I see on social media. Seeing boyfriends post their girlfriends and publicly gush about them always made me feel warm and fuzzy inside, but I’ve come to realize and fully accept that 1. not everything on social media is real 2. some of those couples mostly just post for the hype, and have problems we never see as “outsiders” 3. Some men/women express their love in different ways

Of course, these are things we’ve all heard before. Everyone will tell you “social media doesn’t matter” but sometimes we can’t help our feelings. When I was stuck with this fixation about wanting to be posted on social media, I stopped realizing the true intimacy that was in my relationship that could never compare. 

For example, my boyfriend was going to take a shower. He starts the shower but then comes back to the room and says “How about you wash my hair for me?” I don’t know if you guys have ever washed your partner - but it is probably the most intimate and purest thing, definitely top 5 on my list. I happily agreed, and as he sits down so I can lather his head because he’s so tall, I just think how happy and close with him I feel at that moment. And the thought that came to my mind was “You see, this is something you’ll never be able to see on social media.” 

Then, before I left the shower (I had already showered and he just needed basically a scalp treatment because his dandruff was bothering him) I brought him one of my wash cloths and told him to use it on his pits lol. When he gets back in the room, the first thing he does is run up to me and tells me to smell his armpits! Once again, I laugh and think to myself “Man, we have gotten way too comfortable with each other and I love it.” Another moment that would never be posted on social media. 

Another example, anytime he brings me a glass of water, he always grabs a cup that has kittens on it. Because I am obsessed with cats. I started noticing that he ALWAYS grabbed that cup, and he would go out of his way to wash it if it was dirty. There’s nothing really interesting about posting a photo of a cup - so that’s another sweet thing that doesn’t get posted. 

The point of sharing my story is that I’ve been there. I have some self esteem issues, coupled with anxiety. Sometimes it gets to me. And for a while, I lived with some sort of resentment towards my relationship because it didn’t look like the ones I saw online. But I am so glad I was able to realize the few points I mentioned at the beginning of my post. The minute I stopped comparing and accepting that my partner just simply isn’t one of those people who posts on socials, I started realizing and loving my relationship more genuinely.

172,c15xea,False,Giving Advice,148,"If you can't tell if she's interested, read this.",dating," Women.

&nbsp;

They can be extremely frustrating to deal with when it comes to figuring out if they’re into you or not.

&nbsp;

It’s a terrible feeling to read signals wrong and make a move, only to find out she didn’t intent to come off as interested, or that she was just being nice to you. It can really hinder your ability and confidence to feel comfortable with approaching the next woman. And in some cases, it can leave a really bad taste in guy’s mouths about women in general.

&nbsp;

These things suck, and I’ve seen a healthy amount of posts asking for ways to read into women’s interest. Does she like you if she’s playing with her hair? If she’s having a conversation with you? If she likes your shirt? Where the fuck do you draw the line from friendly to interested? 

&nbsp;

Fortunately, there are subtle things women do that indicate strongly that she’s interested in you, and that you’re golden for an approach. 

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

Generally, (because there are always expectations to the rule) women won’t come right out and tell you that they like you. It’s unfortunate, but it’s also reality in our current social climate. Women are taught to let the men pursue, let the men approach you first. Let the men ask to take you out. They’re taught that to openly pursue a man makes you look like a slut, a whore, an easy girl. And women try to avoid these types of labels.

&nbsp;

Because women are usually raised or conditioned in this manner, they don’t like taking the lead in regard to approaching. Luckily, they still like us, and they still want to help us understand when they like us. When a woman is interested in you, she’s much more likely to give hints and throw subtleties your way, hoping that you’ll pick up on what’s going on and make a move.

&nbsp;

A lot of guys will hear this and simply choose to not waste their time, which is understandable. Why put effort into a girl that can’t express how she feels?

&nbsp;

The thing about that mindset though, is that women that come right out and say “John, I really like you, and I’d like it if you took me out sometime,” are fucking rare. Very fucking rare. And if you decide to sit around and wait for that type of woman, you’ll be waiting for a *very* long time.

&nbsp;

When you don’t have the luxury of bold women approaching you, you’ve got to read the signs. And I’d like to share some valuable knowledge that **really** helped me out with knowing when a woman was genuinely interested in me, or was just being friendly or nice.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**If a woman is interested/comfortable with you, she’ll put herself in your orbit.**

&nbsp;

Now, what does this mean? 

&nbsp;

When a woman likes you, she'll go out of her way to be around you. She'll look for opportunities to touch you, speak to you, or just look at you if you're at a distance. This translates to the texting/calling game too. Have you ever had a girl you've known for a while just text you out the blue with ""Hey"", ""Hi"" or ""What's up?"". Secret gentlemen, she's putting herself in your orbit. She's more than likely hoping you'll take her *invitation* and turn it into a date. The simplest way to go about doing so is this. If a woman you're getting to know or dating texts/calls you, but isn't talking about anything in particular, schedule a date. She's thinking about you, and wants to see you. She probably won't come right out and say so, (I know, frustrating) but you've got to read between the lines.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**General Contact (Verbal/Texting)**

&nbsp;

Going back to putting herself in your orbit, what does this mean? Let’s say you've got someone who you work with. She seems to always greet you when you or she arrives. More interestingly, she always seems to find you, wherever you are, and say farewell when she or you leave. If a woman is constantly greeting you and wishing you well when one or both of you leave work, she's more than likely interested. Especially if she doesn't give everyone at the workplace the same kindness. She's putting herself in your orbit to make it easier for you to make a move.

&nbsp;

Women also carry out this same behavior over texts. If you receive a random text from a woman you’re dating, something along the lines of: 

&nbsp;

-	I just saw this random thing and it reminded me of you!
-	I just thought about that time we went to x!
-	Hey, what are you doing?
-	Are you doing anything today?
-	I just thought about you.
-	How are you? 

&nbsp;

She’s thinking about you. You crossed her mind, and instead of coming right out and saying, “I want to see you, ask me out,” or just asking *you* out on a date (again, frustrating, I know), she’ll put herself in your orbit, she’ll make her presence known, and hope that you understand her actions enough to realize she wants you, in some way, and should schedule a time to get together.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Physical Contact**

&nbsp;

Another way women put themselves in your orbit is through physical touch. Men, if a woman is constantly bumping/brushing up against you, she's interested. I don't care **what** anybody says. People are more than aware of their personal space. They will not consistently bump/brush up against someone that they do not find appealing, physically or in general.

&nbsp;

Likewise, if she's always touching parts of your body, again, she's interested. She's initiating the touch barrier and letting you know she's cool with physical touch. Obviously, don't lose your mind with this statement, that doesn't mean you're good to start squeezing her ass, but if a woman is touching you, it's her way to saying, ""I'm okay with you being physical with me"". 
&nbsp;

Again, it's more frustrating than her just saying ""I'm totally down if you touched me dude"", but again, woman aren't generally that forward.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Eye Contact**

&nbsp;

Finally, eye contact. Fellas, if you’ve caught a girl staring at you for the fifteenth time, she’s interested in you. I know you may think she’s starting at something behind you, or looking at somebody that happens to be close by you, but let’s be honest here. If you’re consistently finding her gaze at you, even when you **move** locations, she’s staring at something she likes, which is you.

&nbsp;

Now, I understand eye contact can be iffy at times. So, if you’re still on the fence on whether a girl is looking at you because she’s interested, or because she’s just so disgusted with you, the next time you catch you looking, maintain eye contact for a second, and **grin**. You don’t have to full on smile if you don’t want to.

&nbsp;

If she smiles back at you, even if she averts eye contact while doing it (it’s okay, she’s nervous), she’s interested, and she wants you to approach her. If she doesn’t smile back, and looks away, sorry champ, she isn’t into it.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

These aren’t *all* the signs women show to express their interest in you, but they’re the basic things to look out for in you’re wanting to know if you’ve got a shot or not. Perhaps one day we’ll live in world where everyone can just be blunt and honest, without fear of rejection. But until that day, I hope this information can help you.

It's going so well, and the energy hasn't died down at all since we started to date. I always had a hard time getting a girlfriend, and got rejected a whole bunch of times. Even when I did had one, they all ended even when I tried my best to save it.

But this girl is different. I was just going through GameStop, and I was geeking out over a pokeball popcorn machine. She was actually just about to leave till she saw how excited I was. I didn't cause a disturbance, I was just really excited that it's in store finally. She approached me first, and talk about Pokemon. She even brought her 3ds, and we traded Pokemon. It was awesome that happened because soon after she wanted to hangout with me at a pizza place.

We did went to the pizza place(Stevie B's pizza), and had a awesome time getting to know each other a little bit more. It wasn't until we left she texted me she would like to go on a date. I was flabbergasted about it, but I was nonetheless excited. On the day we went on the date, everything changed. I was shy, so I tried to start small talk. I wasn't good, but I did my best. But it wasn't till she asked me my favorite superhero that we enjoyed each other company. I said Superman, and she said which one. I said Kingdom come, and she said red son Superman. After that, we talked about many geeky stuff so long we realized a hour passed because we were having a good time enjoying each other company.

Fast forward to now; We cook foods from cartoons, anime, and video games. We talk about geeky stuff up to 8 hour's sometimes. We even went on a date to a planetarium, zoo, and astronaut museum. For the first, I'm not awkward to a girl who enjoys my company. Rather she adores my company because she's able to be super geeky around me. We're open to each, we play fighting games together, we watch cartoon/anime movies together. It's so awesome and relieving to meet a lady that's as geeky as this.

180,gn9q0k,False,Giving Advice,115,Beware Of Love Bombing,dating,"I have been reading about ladies using the level of texting to tell whether a guy is into them or not but sometimes this isn't always true. Some guys in the very beginning will text you from morning to evening, say all the right words, compliment you day and night, send you all the beautiful songs etc and then when you are in so deep they will either ghost you or withdrawal which inturn will drive your crazy wondering what you did wrong, you will start apologising for things you didn't do and guess what, you will blame yourself for being too clingy and for messing up something so perfect! 

But you weren't in the wrong at all, some people use it as technique to get what they want by being the perfect prince charming, they will even plan the future with you and make you feel like they are the one! When it takes even longer or seems like they won't get it, they will ghost or withdrawal completely. It is never about you, its about them winning the game. 

So as you get so excited about him texting you every minute and thinking he can't get enough of you, ask yourself important questions? Listen to your intuition, if something is too good to be true, it often isn't true. 

Someone can text you all day because they are bored not because they can't get enough! Someone will text you twice a week because they are generally busy but they do really like you and want to know you! Also a word of advice stalking someone to see if they are online is unhealthy and will lead you to madness. Learn to know the person you are dealing with and don't let texting be the measure of how much that person loves you! There are so many ways to know someone loves you besides texting and the ultimate is being straight up and asking them.

He offered to let me stay at his place. I was reluctant, but it beat the alternative of going on the train and the possibility of falling asleep and missing my stop. He promised he would do whatever was needed to make sure I was safe and comfortable.

183,hnumm7,False,Venting,194,I Went On Such An Awkward Date....,dating,"I need to get this off my chest somewhere. Lol.
I’m on a cell, ignore the mistakes pls! So sorry in advance.

I met a guy on Tinder I thought seemed really cool! We chatted from daylight to dark it seemed, and had a lot in common. He was a single father, out of a divorce for a year. He told me why the previous marriages ended. 

Restrictions have lifted quite a bit in my state, so we agreed to meet. I’m actually in a county with barely a handful of cases.
Anyways, I offered to meet halfway. According to the app he was 78 miles away. He said no, he’d happily drive to {insert county} Bc he had kids in another state, and he was so use to driving! It didn’t bother him, no big deal!

So we meet, he wasn’t quite what I expected. I was okay with that though. I suggested we go eat, I wasn’t sure what else to do.
So we ordered, and convo seems to be going great and just flowing. Food comes, we eat. Towards the end the waitress lays our check on the table. Several minutes pass. He didn’t touch nor look at the check. She walked by maybe 5-6 times.
Finally I say “well guess I’ll have to get this” and handed her my card. She walks away and he said “oh do you expect cash or something for that?” He had a $10 in his hand. I do want to add, my meal was $9.99, my drink, I had about $13 on a $58 ticket. So yes he ordered an expensive steak dinner. So of course I wasn’t too thrilled. I said “oh well I guess you don’t have to if you don’t want to?” I’m too polite I know!! He shoves his money back in his pocket Bc he “didn’t want to”

After this we drive. I didn’t know what else to do. I was trying to be nice Bc he did drive quite a distance.
I need to add - He kept mentioned a hotel when he first got in. Even mentioned it on messages. How big it was etc.
I didn’t think too much about it. So I finally go back to his car and park. I said “well! I think I should be getting home to my kiddos.” But he kept mentioning the hotel. Was the pool open? It looked so nice. He had absolutely nothing at all to do the next day. He had to drive that far, it was him that drove that far and now he had to drive all the way back, maybe he should get a room.
He pulls out his phone and logs into a bank app, I assume. He starts saying “I don’t know where my money goes” then starts naming things down the list. He says gas like 4 times. He’s like “I mean I’m the one that had to drive” I said “yes I offered to meet you closer, you said numerous times you would rather come here.” He said “well my account is at 17, I don’t like it going below $15 but I really need a room Bc I had to drive and pay for gas” I’m not sure if he meant $1500 and $1700 or $15 and $17. Lol. I didn’t ask.
This was so awkward to me. I began to think about this. Did he want me to pay for a room for him?? What was he expecting.?? I was so confused.
I said 3 more times, well I had better get back home and pick up my kids, I have to work early tomorrow.
“Well I have absolutely nothing at all to do tomorrow and I had to drive here.”
We had sat here for about 3 hours with him saying he “loved my thick thighs” and kept touching my hair. He said he loved short hair Bc he could “pull on it” and grabbed the back of my head. Then he’d start again “you think that pool is open at the hotel?” Of course I didn’t know. Then “gosh I’d really love to have a room tonight” he said this maybe 4-5 times.

On the way home I began thinking. He had asked such odd questions, I don’t know why I didn’t notice before.
Like he asked what my parents did. Asked at a random time, not during a convo about their jobs or anything like that.
He also asked how much money I made, and if I currently had money. He also Complained about his ex wife never working and having to be the sole provider. He just got so fed up and couldn’t take it. That seemed like too much detail for me, esp to someone you don’t really know.

186,fqjqpt,False,Giving Advice,133,Dating is Time-Consuming – 5 Tips Women Need to Stop Wasting Time,dating,"Dating is time-consuming.

Suppose, you're dating a confident and successful guy. But he's in a bad mood all the time. You put up with it, thinking that you’ll change him. Until finally, you get fed up and break up with him.

And then you regret the time lost.

Here's how you can stop wasting your time right now.


## Tip 1: Build a solid foundation with values

Let's say you meet a guy and he seems great. But then you realize he's dishonest. That's a clear sign the guy is wasting your time. Dishonesty isn't a good place to start.

What do you need for an amazing relationship? *A solid foundation.* But how do you build it exactly? You need to know your values and make sure they match those of your romantic partner.

To understand your values, ask yourself questions like these:

· What kind of a family do I want?

· How important is communication to me?

· How much integrity and self-discipline do I expect from a partner?

· How much negativity can I tolerate?

Now, you need a guy with similar values.

## Tip 2: Don't idealize him

Let me use Robin Williams as an example.

He married his first wife, Valerie, at 26. Soon, Valerie realized he couldn't be faithful to her.

But she idealized him:

*He's the great Robin Williams and I can live with his infidelity, I guess.*

But that was her head making the choice. Whereas in her heart, she knew she was betraying herself. And they got a divorce eventually.

That said, you might meet a great guy. He's confident, successful, and funny. But there's still something you don't like about him. Don't idealize him for those good qualities to avoid time-consuming dating.

*Listen not just to your head but also to your heart.*

## Tip 3: Don't change him

Suppose, a guy you're dating says he can't commit to a relationship right now. But he's great otherwise.

And you think, “I can change him. I'll make him commit.”

They say that people don't change. I believe they do but only as long as they want it. Just because you want him to change doesn't mean that he will.

That said, I respect you for the willingness to help him change. Feeling your support is very important for a man. It helps him build a business or career and also grow personally. But why waste your energy on someone who doesn't care?

*Save it for the right person!*

## Tip 4: Don't go along because you want to be nice

Let me illustrate with an example of a girl who had a suppressive father.

He would get angry often. And she learned to be nice to him in those moments. Otherwise, he wouldn't have loved her—a scary thought for a little girl.

Now in her early thirties, she met a guy who was strong, confident, and aggressive. This guy would get angry with her just as her father did. And without much thinking, she was nice to him in those moments as well. That was her default behavior learned in childhood.

But after a while, her resentment got so huge that she couldn't take it anymore. And she broke up with him. But with dating being so time-consuming, she lost so much time.

*So, don't be nice when it feels wrong.*

Ask yourself:

· Am I being unreasonably nice to my partner?

· Can I stop going along with what I don't like?

· How do I be more assertive about what I need?

· How can I set my boundaries and keep them up?

## Tip 5: Let him know and let him go

If you don't like something about a guy you're dating, you've got to let him know. And if he doesn't want to change, let him go.

Let's say he doesn't want to commit to a relationship. Sit down with him and talk about it.

Use this formula from *How to Have a Good Day* by Caroline Webb:

· Warmth

· Explanation

· Offering an alternative

· Ending with warmth

Here's what you can say:

### Warmth

Thank you for being a great boyfriend.

I love how gentle and loving you are.

I want our relationship to work.

### Explanation

I need you to commit to the relationship.

If you can do it, I'll be the happiest girl ever.

### Offering an alternative

If you feel you can't, I'll respect that.

It'll break my heart but it'll be the right thing to do.

### Ending with warmth

Thank you for coming into my life.

I adore you.

### How you'll feel

As a result, you'll feel better. And you'll also feel inner peace.

You did what's right and now you can trust the universe to figure out what's best for you.

If he's right for you, he'll come back.

## Now, I want to turn it over to you

Which of these tips will you use to stop wasting time?

· Is it building a solid foundation with values?

· Or not hoping that he'll change?

187,cxrw9p,False,Venting,152,"Best date ever, but disgusting ending",dating,"Me (24M, Belgian) had Tinder date a couple of days ago. We met, and instantly felt a great connection. We walked around town and sat at a pub for 8 hours straight and it literally was like the best date ever. We hit it off great, had a lot of fun (some great dark humor) and great conversation and we both felt both a physical attraction as well as a more serious connection on a more personal/emotional level. Time flew by, and it was the best date I ever had. We planned a new date a week later to the Belgian natural history museum, and were just walking home to her place at around 3 or 4 a.m., where we would watch some porn (for some reason, we wanted to discus the graphic details in some explicit Anime/Hentai movies). Anyway, as we're walking to her place, we ended up talking about the one time she had intercourse with another girl. She said it was a great experience, but a one time thing. She said she certainly was not lesbian because lesbians/gays have a disease, according to her. I was shocked. For some time I kept questioning her about this, and turns out she strongly beliefs non-heterosexuals have a genetic disease, are worth less than others and in an ideal world they should be dead. Then, she went on by trying to justify her homophobia (or convince me of it) by saying ""of course I think this, I also am racist because I am smart"". Isn't that a great line of reasoning (btw, she actually is smart as she is a PhD student just like me). Turns out, she felt people from other races were worth less and should have less/no human rights in order to make them become extinct in the future. She was not kidding.

Anyway, I felt sick in my stomach upon realizing she was homophobic and racist. I sat down for 2 minutes on the street as I was quite shocked, then said something to her and just walked away. Now, I feel like an idiot for really liking this girl, having like the best date ever only to realize she is so sick in the head. I mean, I really cannot stand homophobia or racism. It is the first time I had such an awesome date, also as I don't have that much dates as I am not the most social person. Now, I don't think I will date for a while as I feel the universe is playing tricks on me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cxrw9p/best_date_ever_but_disgusting_ending/,725,"Since everything else was great, you could have just accepted to ignore personal beliefs.

188,cjy4ko,False,None,99,I [25F] went on the most perfect first date and I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to jinx it.,dating,"I replied to a guy who id been following for a while’s instagram story of a meal he was having saying the restaurant he was at was my favorite. We talked for a week or two and he asked me if he could take me out on a date and show me his favorite.

For some reason the day of the date I was excited instead of the usual nervousness. I met him at his job and we took the subway to the restaurant. He ordered his favorite meals (nearly half the menu) and we shared a bottle of wine.

He joked about not liking small talk and I suggested we pretend like it’s our third date instead of our first. We then talked about some pretty serious things like family dynamics, my father abandoning me as a child, our past relationships, and everything in between. 

He then told me he wasn’t looking to mess around, he was looking for something serious that could potentially lead to marriage. Normally I’d be put off by a statement like that but I wasn’t. 

The last two guys I dated were so hesitant they didn’t even want to call our dates “dates”. One of them ghosted me. The other told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship after months of me trying to define what we were. And here this guy was, telling me exactly what he wanted in a matter of fact way.

We left the restaurant but neither of us wanted to go home so he suggested we go for a walk. He asked me if it was okay if he put his arm around me and I said yes. We walked to a street corner and were waiting to cross the street when he pulled me in closer and kissed me. 

I’ve never felt a kiss like that, I literally didn’t care that we were kissing in the middle of the street and there were people walking by and watching. He then got me a cab home and told me he was going away for vacation for two weeks on Thursday but that he really wanted to see me one more time before he left. So we agreed to see each other again tomorrow. 

I just have butterflies all day today and I’m so excited to see him again. I have such a good feeling about this guy, I wish I could explain it without sounding crazy.

EDIT: I knew when I wrote this post, there would be a lot of cynical, Debbie downer comments. I myself am a cynical Debbie downer sometimes. “He’s just trying to get in your pants”, “he’s lying”... etc.

While these may be true, I’m sticking with my happy feelings instead. He has done nothing to show me that he’s lying or that he’s being sketchy. He has wine and dined me without asking for a single thing in return. He got me a cab home and didn’t ask to come over. All green flags in my book. 

So I’m choosing to be happy and excited and bubbly for now. 

And if he turns out to be a horrible, dishonest person, then I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cjy4ko/i_25f_went_on_the_most_perfect_first_date_and_im/,716,He's lying. You wouldn't believe it if it was truth. ,2019-07-30 21:08:31
189,hm1l11,False,Giving Advice,120,Bf and I fell in love while on shrooms during COVID-19 pandemic!,dating,"Ok so I just wanted to share my story because before this happened, I was searching for threads like this all over reddit and Google and couldn't find that many! And I hope this short (long) story inspires some hope for those lost hopeless romantics who feel like they'll never find ""the one""!

Alright so I (22 f) started talking to this guy (21 M) I had as a friend on Facebook but never really talked to. We had people in common, went to different schools, but didn't really know each other personally (aside from Facebook stuff).


Anyway, I had just gotten out of a long term relationship that i had already gotten over months prior. (On and off and not a good time).


So I was reading this book at work one day, and out of the blue I thought to myself ""hey this main character description sounds a lot like this guy I have as a friend on Facebook."" I ended up messaging him at around 6am to tell him. I have no idea why, I just wanted him to know, and I wanted him to read the book. Anyway a few messages later, he said he was interested in reading the book! I was so excited. I love when people take interest in things I'm interested in, because I love discussing them. Anyway I didn't think much of it, I was mostly excited that he wanted to read the book. So I said he could borrow my copy, and i would drop it off after work. WELL the copy I had at the time wasn't even mine, it was borrowed (from a patient of mine). 

So right after work, I drove to the nearest barnes & noble (20 miles from my house) and got the book. This store is located inside a shopping mall, so while I was there, I picked up a bunch of makeup and clothing because I was so excited. It wasn't until after I got into my car that I asked myself ""why am I so excited? Why did I buy all this stuff?"" So he told me where he lived, I drove to his house to drop off the book. I was so nervous. He finally came out, i gave him the book through the car window, he got it and rushed off back into his house and said ""thanks! Sorry I gotta go. I have something on the stove.""
I was like wow okay I guess thats is. I mean what did I expect? 


But NO. We ended up talking more and more and hanging out almost every single night. It was ALWAYS an adventure with this guy. He didn't even have to try. Somehow the night just always ended up being so much fun. We hung out at this lake by our town mostly and just talked. Or we'd go to some views around the city. This went on for about 3 weeks. 

During that whole time, our relationship was completely platonic. We did not confess feelings for each other, we did not compliment each other, we did not flirt AT ALL, we did not kiss, hug, hold hands, go to each others houses, we didn't make crude jokes about sex or dating. It was like we were becoming close friends. Not once did he flirt with me or try to make a move. NOT. ONCE.


So when we first started hanging out, I was guarded and told myself I would not develop a crush for this guy and I would not flirt with him or allow myself to catch feelings. I even restricted myself from admitting he was cute. I limited myself to only talking about past relationships vaguely and not talking about my interests in guys or relationships. I will admit i did this mostly because I thought this guy was WAY out my league, even before I met him. He's one of those guys that gets a bunch of likes on Facebook and gives off those talks-to-a-million-girls vibes. At least thats what i thought back then (yes i know I'm ashamed for thinking this way). I didn't want him to think I was just another girl that was going to be all over him. 


So over time I actually started to catch myself day dreaming about him. I would immediately stop myself. I was really trying not to like this guy. But I couldn't help it. He has an amazing personality, he's so much fun without even trying to be. He always seemed so genuine and never tried too hard at anything. He didn't try to impress me he was just himself. And I always thought he was soooo handsome. But too handsome for me. I mean i think I'm okay looking, but at the time I just thought this guy would never see me that way. Especially with how interesting he is. I considered myself pretty boring. The home-body type.


So one day he told me about his shroom experience. That was probably the first time he told me something so personal. He told me he used to be really quiet, shy, insecure, angry. I was really surprised because this did not seem like him at all. He wasn't shy when first meeting me. He's so patient and nice. He always had something to talk about. He just seemed like the perfect social butterfly.


I had never experienced shrooms before, but I was interested. So a few weeks later, I decided I wanted to try something new.


My life was in a great place. I was newly single, my career was taking off. I loved my job, was making really good money, things at home were great, my friends were all around me. This guy was making things really interesting. Life was just awesome.


So I decided I wanted to try shrooms. I did so. Much. Research. I researched for days. Any chance I got, I spent planning and researching. I ended up coming up with this idea. I'd find us a really nice comfortable place where we could trip safely. I really wanted this to be an unforgettable experience for him (at the time I wouldn't admit why). So i first asked him if he wanted to do shrooms. He said yes. I asked about his schedule for work. So I ended up getting an air bnb really cheap (very beginning of pandemic, pre-stay-at-home enforcement).


 I planned the whole thing. What we would eat. Activities while we tripped. I got different type of bud just in case he had a preference. I made sure the air bnb was in a woodsy location because I knew he was really into that type of environment. I had to locate a plug for the shrooms too which is not easy in a small town, but i was determined!!
I was soooo ready!


Its important to note that at this time, I was so not sure if he liked me or even found me attractive. He was so aloof. Never complimented me on my looks. Never made a move. Never really showed an interest in me other than just as friends.(Although we never discussed this or had the ""I'm only looking for friends conversation"") I just assumed he only wanted to be friends because of his lack of hinting.


So I decided to just drill it into my brain that this was completely for the shroom experience and would not be romantic at all (me desperately trying not to get my hopes up or formulate unrealistic expectations).
So the day came, he was ready, and we headed up the mountain completely innocent and clueless.


The drive was unbelievably beautiful. Everything was so clear and green with amazing views of the mountains and sparkly lakes. He showed me his favorite music. He had even made me a playlist on spotify. It was becoming harder and harder to not get my hopes up. Every time I looked over at him I just kept thinking holy cow this handsome and unbelievably interesting guy is really taking the time out of his day and willingly spending his weekend with me 😰 


I'll admit I was a bit skeptical at first, how was this guy so perfect? Why has he been hanging out with me so much? Why hasn't he tried anything? I kept waiting for there to be a catch 👀 (to this day, four months later, there has been no catch, he's still perfect!)


So we got to the cabin. Of course it's beautiful. The view is incredible. BUT there's only one bedroom. Only one bed. I nervously explained to him that this was the best cabin with the best view and the best reviewed and that i didn't intend for us to sleep in the same bed, it was just the best choice. He said it was alright not a problem. I offered to sleep on the couch but of course, he said no that he would. So we explored for a bit. Prepared ourselves for the trip and got comfortable. Watched some movies while we waited for it to get dark. (Still nothing romantic at this point).


Then the time came for the shrooms! He ate them whole and i made mine in tea. Holy cowwwwww it WAS THE BEST FEELING AND EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I was tearing up for no reason. We were watching tippy music videos and just laughing and vibing. We kept expressing how beautiful everything was. And after a little while i started to really admire him. His smile just looked so beautiful and his eyes were extra shiny and i loved it. 

I ended up getting really nervous being around him but I couldn't tell him why because I didn't want to ruin things. I just covered myself with a blanket and sat on the couch as far from him as possible. He could tell something was wrong and was trying to comfort me. I could tell he was concerned so I tried my best to just act normal again. We were laughing again and I have no idea how we ended up in each other's arms but next thing you know he's smiling and laughing and then KISSED ME. I felt like I was a little kid again and It was like fireworks went off in my chest, I was like at the peak of my trip. After we stopped kissing, he said ""hold on, I'll  be right back."" I thought he was going to tbe bathroom. But when he came back, he was holding a small box in his hand, he gave it to me and I was completely shocked. He said ""i got this for you."" I open it and its this beautiful heart shaped necklace, the color of my birthstone, with matching earrings. I nearly died. This has never happened to me in my.life. I had never felt so wooed. 


After that, we just cuddled on the couch together. We were both super quiet. He kept asking if I was alright. Hell yeah I was better than alright. I just couldn't stop thinking about how amazing I felt and how much I loved what happened and how everything fell into place so perfectly. I couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I felt and I swear I felt like I was in a movie. The cabin was warm and cozy, it was super cold outside and foggy, and i was lying in this amazing guys' arms after he kissed me and gave me this amazing gift. I was quiet from the disbelief I was experiencing, but I'm pretty sure he thought I was quiet because I felt weird about what happened. I got up after a while and said I was going to bed. I was still kind of tripping at this point but for some reason I wanted to go to bed. 


After I got into bed, he came in a few moments later (as I hoped he would) and asked if we could share the bed. My heart almost exploded. He came in and we just started to spill the beans. He confessed that he really liked me, but never made a move because he didn't want me to feel like he was only hanging out with me to get with me and because he didn't want me to feel like things were moving too fast. He didnt want me to feel pressured. I confessed my feelings as well and we both couldn't stop talking about how we felt like we were in a movie and how we were just perfect for each other. This went on the whole night until almost morning time. He kept telling me he thought I was beautiful and interesting and perfect in every way. He kept holding me tight and seemed so happy. I'd never seen anyone so happy. 


We ended up having sex. AMAZING SHROOM SEX. We were coming down already but it was still out of this world.


We ate in the morning and then cuddled some more. We couldn't get enough of each other. On the drive home we held hands and couldn't stop talking about our feelings for each other and about the experience. 


We've been together 5 months now and I can honestly say I understand cheesy romance movies now. Hes still very lovey-dovey, we understand each other so well, we love doing things together. Despite our previous failed relationships we have NO trust issues. Not at all. Literally the only problem we have is that we both get cranky when we're hungry.

My family immediately accepted him. His family is the same with me. We've pretty much been dating throughout the whole pandemic and I honestly think it has made us really close. We're best friends and I honestly don't think theres any toxicity in our relationship. We communicate sooooooo well. We're both there for each other and it's amazing. We both have gone through so many things in the short time we've been together, but somehow, every issue seems so small because we get through these things together. Its just amazing how quickly someone can change your life so unexpectedly! We've both changed so much already in many different ways (for the better) in such a short amount of time!
It feels so unreal. I honestly never thought I could fall for someone. I really thought people just pretended to be happy or something. But nope healthy love is real!!! Anyway i just wanted to share this because I really love our story!! I hope everyone out there feeling like they'll never find ""the one"" read this and get a little hope out of it!

Had the same interests, texted or saw each other everyday, etc.. I took her out to dinners and beach trips, all paid for by me cause she was broke and had no job. I did everything for this person and I wasnt expecting anything in return besides a little respect and gratitude. I even found her a job and helped her with a car payment at one point. Shortly after helping her find a job she came to me with ""I dont want to be intimate with you anymore, because I feel like I'm not over my ex still"". My response was that I was fine with it. She suggested proceeding as friends and I agreed. Then a week later I find her tinder profile advertising to do the very same activities she was doing with me the last few months. She also had been making mild comments about dating other guys when we would hang out. I called her out on her shit and the chaos that ensued ended my friendship with her and my mutual friend. She basically tried to claim that I only wanted to be friends so that I could date her again at some point. She also(conveniently) never paid me back some money I had lent her and started ghosting me.

And let me be clear, you can be decent and still keep your boundaries.  Like for example, if a guy doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant, he can decline that if a girl suggests it and it doesn't make him an asshole, but it does if he does it anyway and expects something in return for it.

194,fczhk2,False,Question,194,"European style of dating: They don't ""date"". They hang out and see what happens.",dating,"I'm probably being too broad when I say ""european"". When I first heard there was not a strong tradition ""dating"" over there (specifically France) I wondered what that meant. I was told by a friend that it simply meant you hung out with people with no preconditions or assumptions. Then if the mood and timing was right, you acted on it.

I have dated over the past year. For the most part I've avoided putting any real effort into dating for about 4 months now. This ""euro style"" came to mind because I think I have accidently found myself doing that. Let me draw some comparisons.

&#x200B;

**Example 1**

I did go on a ""date"" with someone about a month ago. We met through a dating site. 

* This means we were both trying to process each other.
* Understand if we could be partners.
* We probably had our mind on the potential of romance, overlooking the potential for friendship.
* We probably both wondered IF sex was a possibility.

Under that setup there's a lot of pressure and it didn't work out. It was a date and so I only analyzed it from that perspective and I imagine she did to some extent as well.

&#x200B;

**Example 2**

**Here's an example of another recent situation.** I asked out a coworker with very honest intentions: I wanted to socialize and make friends.

* I thought she was cute but I was not necessarily super attracted to her but I didn't care because I wasn't trying to ""date"" her.
* I didn't entirely care whether she liked me too much. I just wanted a friend at work and meet a new person.
* Eventually when her and I hung out at a bar, I did not necessarily consider it a date. She didn't either. I didn't really have strong interest in her at the time. 
* However as the months passed... we've both realized we really enjoy each other's company more than we expected. There's a lot of flirtation and tension there. It's fun.

What made Example 2 so interesting is that I was never focused on asking myself if she sees me as a romantic partner. It allowed us to just take our time and get to know each other.

195,9yamuf,False,Other,108,The girl I’m dating made me a playlist,dating,"So I’ve been on two dates with a girl who’s pretty quiet, because she’s quiet I sometimes second guess myself that she actually likes me. 

After the second date we were on our way back to hers when she passed out in the Uber and was sick on the sidewalk. I helped her roommates get her into bed and slept on the couch because I’m not an asshole. The next day we chilled together until like 4pm when she had work, I made her pancakes as a hangover cure and we just cuddled in bed all day, it was great. 

Anyway fast forward to now, we’re both away for the week and I’m second guessing myself again when she texts me saying she made me a playlist called “To ‘my name’” (we both love music). I thought this was one of the coolest things someone has ever done for me two dates in and it made me grin for 5 minutes straight, it made me feel so likeable. I made one for her too to reciprocate, but god damn I can’t stop listening to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/9yamuf/the_girl_im_dating_made_me_a_playlist/,710,This is lame.

196,ckdu92,False,None,287,A Dating Handbook for Guys: How I've Had Many Successful Dates,dating,"**Disclaimer**: This isn't a rulebook. This worked for me and there is no one right way to date. Do whatever works for you. I don't mean for this to sound braggy either, I've been ghosted and had bad dates as well! I just found some things that helped and wanted to share.

Also, I'm measuring ""success"" as finding someone who reciprocates your feelings and shows mutual interest. Not necessarily ""we had sex on the first date.""

Let's begin.

**The app:**

* It's 2019, we're all on the apps, Hinge and Bumble I've had the best luck on, in that order. Make sure your photos are decent quality and show your face up close and whole body. 
NO shirtless mirror pics, no selfies if possible. Make sure your main (1st photo) is clearly only you so girls don't have to guess which one you are in a group photo.

* It's important to approach dating, as a guy, from the perspective that you are qualifying them. Too many guys are trying to impress, compliment, and put women on a pedestal. Once you match with a girl, see if she's even what you are into. Any connection there? Great, after 10 min or an hour (whenever you get a feeling she's what you're into) I would usually drop, ""I'm not on here much, [my phone number] text me if you want."" 9/10 times I'd get a text within 10 minutes. 

**Texting**:

* At this point you're seeing if you want to get a 1st date together. Usually I'd ask for an IG profile if they didn't have good pics to make sure they really look how they appeared in the dating app. 

* I like asking, ""What are a few things you like about yourself that don't have to do with your appearance?"" This requires a bit of depth and weeds out the superficial girls. Also, you get to know them on a slightly deeper level early on.

* I've run text conversations for an hour or a few days if I'm unsure about a date. At some point I'd say, ""Do you want to get drinks some time?"" Again, 99% of the time they say yes. Think about it, they matched with you, kept talking in the dating app, took your number down, texted you first, kept texting you for however long, so there's a high chance they agree to a date!

**The first date:** 

* Text her the morning of, ""I'm excited to meet you later, I'll see you at [time agreed upon]!"" This allows her to confirm she's going. If she doesn't respond she's not interested and is a shitty human being for ghosting you the day of. Let it go and move on.

* It's always drinks. I know it sounds boring but if the date is a disaster, doesn't look like her photos, is weird, you finish your drink and leave. You're not stuck eating, waiting for a check, waiting for a movie or game to end. 

* Know a little about the bar you're going to beforehand and pick a quiet area so you can actually hear eachother. 

* Get there 5 minutes early and order.

* Stand up when she arrives and give her a FULL HUG, no side hug, no fucking hand shake, no kissing, just give a solid hug (like 2 seconds) and say how nice it is to see them.

* Ask them questions! Remember you're seeing if this is someone you want to continue dating. Moments of silence are OK, maintain healthy normal eye contact but be direct. 

* After about 1.5 hours I typically say that I'm ready to call it a night if they are. It's good to end the 1st date on a high note. Ironically if you guys are having a good time and you call the date to a close this does seem to make them consider that you were not having a great time. Personally I just don't like sitting and talking for a long ass time. 

* ALWAYS PAY FOR THE DRINKS. They should offer but just fucking pay. Chances are you picked the bar, you knew the drink prices, and you shouldn't be taking people out if you can't afford a few drinks. If they offer to leave the tip I always let them. Paying can actually help out later, I'll bring it up again.

* Walk them to their car give them a hug and say, ""I had a really great time."" 

About 70% of the time the girl would text me when she got home thanking me for the drinks or commenting on the date being nice. 

Forgot to mention, get the door for them especially if you're driving. 

**MORE DISCLAIMERS: I wrote the above in a way that makes it sound like I'm literally saying exactly what to do, I'm not, I'm just saying that's what I've done. Every date is different and complex, I've made out at the end of a 1st date because I texted/talked to a girl for a week before, and then I've had dates where I texted the girl for 2 days before going out together so there wasn't as much chemistry yet.

His immediate response, was ""No your not, I will meet you at 8pm, and we will have the best bro date""

Just wanted to give him a shout out, the guy didn't skip a beat to support me and turn what would have been a pretty horrible night into a great one.

So an update for you guys. We met at the indoor mini golf place we have drinks, we play, we actually meet some really nice couples playing golf in front of us and behind us.

The past days has been a massive mix of excitement and nerves. But just forty minutes ago, I ordered an appetizer for us. Then I got up and got down on one knee. We were smacked dab in the middle of a busy restaurant. Everyone started looking, her hands covered her mouth. I asked her to marry me. 


AND SHE SAID YES!!!!!!!!

I feel so fucking blessed! (Sorry for the profanity). The entire restaurant clapped for us. The waitress said she will give us a free dessert if we want. My ~~girlfriend~~ fiancé is crying tears of joy and calling her family and is so excited she is asking wedding questions and venue stuff. She has had a venue planned ever since she was a little girl and wants a big wedding. I preordered it last week and she is getting the wedding of her dreams.

199,d4r8fi,False,Venting,376,The hardest part about dating as a man is that women are attracted to you for being confident. But your confidence is constantly tested.,dating,"There was an interesting exchange I saw earlier this week on facebook. In a group I am in. One of the leaders. A really confident guy that is always happy go lucky, made a post about how girls always want him as a bf. Someone responded about how hard it is really to achieve that, and everyone piled on and made fun of him, calling him cringy and creepy. this sort of exchange happens in all the circles i am in. It would probably happen to me too if I didn't hide my feelings.

The fact of the matter is that we men can't show our feelings. We can't show weakness. We can't show vulnerability. That is cringy, creepy and draws women away. Everyone piles up and boots us in the face if we do.

I don't know how to explain it. Its like the confident guys get propped up and the unconfident guys get torn down. And that is why so few men get women.

And I think. Thats just how human beings are wired to be. It makes sense. We evolved such that strong men are rewarded. There is no escape from it.

I'm sorry. I'm not angry. I don't hate anyone (except myself really). Its just like. I understand more and more why I don't deserve love and I'm trying to process it a lot better.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Damn this thread got big.

OK so everything I have heard hear I actually have heard before. There is a lot of:

\- Just believe in yourself it will happen eventually

\- Don't fall for toxic masculinity. Women love vulnerable men

\- Just take a break.

\- Get therapy

\- Workout

\- Fuck you. Your too negative.

\- You wouldn't want the attention anyway. If you actually try you'll get a quality relationship

\- You are better than you think you are

\- Get hobbies and make friends. It will make you happier

Don't know what to say guys. I have been sadposting on reddit for years. I appreciate your responess though .

I do find that there are general patterns of what people say. And I wonder if it reflects more on you guys and your situations vs me. Dunno really. I am not saying anyone is wrong. Its just . I guess it feels I am alone in this one way or another.

Also those of you that have sent you encouraging dms thank you very much. I know others experience this as well. Honestly. when I see someone else facing loneliness i want to encourage them more than me. I am weird. It is easy for me to love others and not myself. I am fated to guide people to a treasure i can not possess myself.

For all the times we try to take someone on a fun date or adventure and they end up either not being into it or things just fizzle out, when is the last time you took yourself out? I know that other people who go to these things have the same interests. Without a date you're pretty much free to talk to whoever you want and just share the experience.

I'm just excited to be making myself a priority instead of constantly trying to think about some girl I matched with or wishing things had gone better with a date.

We talked and talked for days, went to a concert and had dinner together a couple of times. She spent a couple of nights at my place but we never had sex because her interest in me was, at least what she said, only as friends. I have been through a bad relationship in the past and we’ve been friends for 5 years before we started dating and that was a toxic relationship. Before we started she slept at my place too, cuddled and teased but never really did anything more. Now this dynamic that I have been “offered” now was quite similar to the one 5 years ago.

I liked her, she was witty, smart, had dark humor, ambitions, was beautiful and charming. 

I have been somebody who is sleeping around most of my past 10 years. I rarely connect to people on a deeper level. And that is why I was hopeful that this would go on and could turn into something beautiful.

But I am proud of myself that I stopped it. I realised I am fulfilling her needs for closeness and I think love should not be like that.

I think love should be limitless. Love without negotiations about “what we should be”.

I think it should free you and not make you nervous, I think it should feel like a safe harbour and not make you want to play a certain role to be likable.

I’m proud of myself for setting boundaries and even though I liked this girl so much I would respect myself and my needs and call it off because she could not meet them.

I feel like I’m going crazy because I had this opportunity infront of me but decided not to got for it and hopefully it will be worth it one day.

Respect yourself people. Respect your needs, your emotions, your wishes. Don’t throw yourself out there for somebody who just wants to hang out with you because of their needs.

Often many men will put beautiful they see/meet on a pedestal and act completely different from who they actually are, which only pushes them away. You wouldn’t change the game plan that got you to the championship, would you? Be yourself and know that you yourself are enough to shoulder your own happiness. Girlfriends aren’t meant to be your happiness, they are there to enhance it. You need to wake up everyday, look in the mirror and have the mentality of “you know what? I’m a F****** catch and anybody would be lucky to have me”.

No matter what you are always the driver, never let anybody take you out of the drivers seat to your glory. If people want to get in? Make sure they are worth it. If they want to get out?

On the topic of waiting... 
On the topic of ""taking a break""...
On the topic of ""if it's meant to be, we'll happen again""...

Don't. 

Don't wait. Don't tell people you guys are taking a break. Don't hope that maybe after they're done fooling around they'll come back to you. 

Because if they fucked up, know that they messed it up, and STILL aren't coming around, then why do they deserve you? 

An anonymous note to my ex: I knew you weren't the one when you told me you missed me, told me I was the best thing you lost out on, and STILL didn't do anything to get me back. If you really thought those things you wouldn't be dating someone else right now. 

To whoever needs to hear this, choose YOURSELF before you choose the person you love. Don't disrespect yourself by letting someone know they can walk back into your life whenever they want. You deserve all the best in the world, not someone who doesn't appreciate you for who you are.

 If you don't know why you do shitty things... you're just going to keep doing them... But that’s only one part of the equation. 

if you're not brave enough to move away from you're current identity, to move into the unknown, to take steps towards self repair, you're going to remain in a ""woe is me"" complex forever. Being upset with your actions is not enough. Self pity is not enough... (Adlerian psychological theory covers this extensively) 

Say you cheated in a previous relationship, my biggest question would be, what did you take away from that? What did you learn about yourself. If you cheated due to low self esteem and a need for outside validation.... and you don't consciously know that... you're 100% going to be doing that shit again because you're flying with blinders on...

 You need to realize that your reactions to what's in front of you are often reactions to dredged up feelings from the past that are being resized to appear congruent to the present.

If you can't accept that you're wrong in certain situations.

221,f9emik,False,Venting,94,"Found my dream girl, and it turns out it was just a dream",dating,"First time posting, not sure how this all works.

About 7 years ago I (29/M) met a girl I fell for super hard and she strung me along, used me, and eventually I found out she was engaged the entire time. This hurt me pretty badly to the point that I gave up on romance and just engaged in one night stands for a few years. I didn't want to get hurt again. Eventually I started ""dating"" people again, but never longer than a few months. I got into some ""relationships"" that I realize now I was only in just for the sake of having a relationship, and I couldn't give them the emotional reciprocity they were seeking. I know it's selfish of me, but that's just where I was.

Which brings me to the story at hand. About 6 months ago I matched with this girl on Hinge. We spoke for a little bit, but never wound up seeing each other. At least not at first. After a few months we started texting semi-regularly. She's a chef from Peru, and we have many common interests like music, traveling, and generally the same worldview. She's passionate, driven, has a kind heart, she's not world weary or overly cynical, and she makes me laugh. It doesn't hurt that she's beautiful either. Eventually I got her out on a date and we hit it off. Nothing too fancy, just some drinks. A few weeks later we went out again, going on a walk in the park that night. We kissed, held hands, all that stuff. We went out a few more times after that, each better than the last. We both felt very comfortable around each other, and I found myself falling for her. There was just one problem: she told me she was moving to Berlin to open up a restaurant with her boss/former coworker. Obviously that seems like a dealbreaker, but it just so happens I lived in Berlin for 2 years, went to school there. So instead of giving up on her I wrote her a little guide to help her get acquainted with the city and its customs, gave her some sites to check out, sent her some apartment hunting websites, etc. I never pretended like she wasn't leaving, but I guess in my fucked up little mind I thought, given my ties to the city, we might be able to work something out.

So last night we went out again, walked around, had some drinks. I asked her if I was going to see her again before she left and she told me she wasn't really looking for anything sentimental, that she had gotten out of a 3 year relationship with her ex last year and wasn't looking for anything. So, given that she was being honest with me, I was honest with her: I told her that I'd never met anyone like her before, that if she was going to any other city in the world I might not have brought it up, and that I was sure that she was going to achieve what she wanted in life more than anyone I've ever met. At this point she almost started crying, and she said was at a point where she was trying to learn how to be alone with herself before looking for a relationship, but she told me she thought I was really great and interesting, and she thanked me for never letting her feel stupid like her ex had made her feel and that she hoped we could still be friends because she found me really easy to talk to and I made her feel good, and that if I ever came back to Berlin she would want to see me. I didn't rule out the possibility of friendship in the future, but I told her I needed some space and that I couldn't see her again before she left, but I said that I didn't regret our time together and I wish her nothing but good things. She understood, so I walked her home and we kissed each other on the cheek before we said our goodbyes.

That was last night, and though it doesn't hurt as bad as I'd feared it might I'm still feeling pretty shitty. I deleted all my dating apps because I know I'm not going to be in any shape to date anyone for a while. She really was the girl of my dreams, and I'm not bitter about it, but that doesn't stop it hurting a bit. I guess if I got anything really great out of this it's that I learned that I could feel things I didn't know were possible, so maybe someday there's a chance I could feel it again? I dunno. Today's kind of a rough day.

223,dutwov,False,Giving Advice,116,What I’ve learned from my first long term relationship: having a sexy partner is important,dating,"Finding your partner sexy is really important. It’s also more of a personality trait than something physical. I think we downplay sexiness too much when it comes to serious relationships, but if your partner isn’t sexy to you at all, your sex life will suffer. I physically thought my partner was attractive, but he dressed terrible and wasn’t confident. This completely turned me off. It was to the point where I didn’t want to kiss him and we could barely even have sex because I was turned off. 

Then my next boyfriend, who I only dated for a few months, was sexy as hell. We were very exclusive, he was only into me, he didn’t play women, but he was confident and knew what he was doing and that people found him attractive. He said he loved my confidence as well. He also had bacne and some loose skin from losing weight, I don’t want you to think you need to be perfect to be sexy. 

While there is a physical component, it is mostly personality. Like if Jared Leto had the mentality that no one liked him and he was awkward and put me up on a pedestal, I wouldn’t be into it. I’m not into cockiness either, but you should both be confident. 

I feel like people don’t talk about this enough and I just wanted to share. I’m a woman with no ass, some skin problems, and thin hair, but I still bring that BDE.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dutwov/what_ive_learned_from_my_first_long_term/,648,Unless you're asexual.

224,d59fzp,False,Giving Advice,121,Dating isn’t for the weak,dating,"I don’t know if anyone needs to read this, but I had an interesting observation and in case if gives even one person the info they need, I thought I’d share. 

Dating is hard. Not talking about FWB or casual hookups but dating. Finding someone compatible and interesting enough to spend an evening with. Finding someone willing to fight at least as hard as you do when things get tough. Our time is valuable. Or it should be. 

So we try to get out there. Maybe bars. Maybe the deep dark abyss of the online marketplace. Maybe we join clubs or volunteer. And we don’t meet anyone that we connect with. Or we do, but it’s not reciprocated and in an era of instant gratification we find ourselves competing with greener grass that may not even exist. 

But here’s what I’ve noticed lately. 

As a 43 year old female, I’m noticing so many of the relationships around me. 

A same age friend just recently started a relationship with the man she has fallen in love with.  They originally met in high school but timing wasn’t right. 

Another friend found her forever partner eight years ago at age 35. 

Another friend ended a 12 year relationship where she hasn’t been happy for 11 years. 

Another just celebrated her 12th anniversary with the love of her life. She’s 42. He’s 44. 

Myself? I’ve been in a relationship for just over a year with a man who has shown me in so many ways why past relationships never worked. He’s everything I never thought possible. He is my anything but not my everything. We met online a week after I proclaimed to someone that my life is pretty amazing and someone’s going to have to be spectacular to be a part of it. He is. 

So I’m not saying you have to be mid 40’s to find the relationship you crave.... not at all. I’m saying that it took an awful lot of us 40+ years to truly figure out what we wanted and to find the courage to say no when our relationships fell short. In that time, we learned a lot about what we didn’t want. We learned a lot about ourselves. We built careers. We raised kids (some of us) and in the end, we allowed our journey to shape us without giving up hope for what we desired in life. A partner. In every sense of the word. 

Kudos to those who already have it all figured out. For everyone else, enjoy the journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/d59fzp/dating_isnt_for_the_weak/,649,"I don't want to meet someone at 40.

228,hjpybb,False,Other,106,Dating with terminal cancer - I am struggling.,dating,"I am sure some of you read the title and thought, shouldn't there be more concerning things on your mind at this point? Dating seems like something not to worry about.

But see, the problem is I am not simply going to up and die in 3, 12, or even 24 months. Or at least I hope not. 

I am what they call, a long-term terminal, a palliative care, or a non-curable cancer patient.  I have cancer that has no cure, will require consistent treatment, impacts my life on a daily basis, and will lead to my death unless a cure comes along.  Just not anytime super soon.  I am still reasonably young (35 male), and was quite healthy before diagnosis meaning my prognosis for survival was good.  Whereas many with this cancer are around 35% over 5 years in terms of survival rate, my doctors estimated I had at least 15+ years, perhaps a lot longer, and that's an eternity in cancer research meaning perhaps I will transition from terminal to simply stable or cured one day. 

But because of this, my life is obviously very affected. I have health limitations which include limits with regards to exercise, diet, stress amounts, and more. I am classified disabled, despite not looking disabled, due to being limited in what I can do work-wise, and on SSDI because of it. I am chained to a location (at least for now) due to treatment and being a research patient (I hope helping others down the road). I live with my parents due to a combination of needing occasional help and my limited income. I am immunocompromised.

But most importantly I am aware enough to realize I am becoming more depressed by the day as I struggle to try and date.  I'll be honest, I was never great at it. I am shy and somewhat of an introvert and while I enjoy social interaction, I lose energy fast (even more so these days). I am certainly what women may call a bumbler when it comes to words and am terrible at reading signs. My confidence in the dating world is not really there even if I have it in other areas of life. Most of my past relationships (and there were only 4) were simply because we connected on a shared interest in art(oh yea I paint, draw, and write poetry as a serious hobby).

But since being diagnosed several years ago I have gone on a grand total of 1 date.  I am lonely. 

Before COVID it was frustrating but I focused on my hobbies, dreamed of better things, and kept putting myself out there with the realization that having what is effectively terminal cancer that would limit my lifespan would probably scare off many women. I realized I was not exactly a catch but I still tried. I was raised right by my parents, and my sisters were always very supportive, and I knew I had something to offer whichever wonderful woman took a shot on me. I knew I would do my best to make her happy whether the relationship lasted 1 week or the rest of my life.

But as time has passed it got harder to maintain a positive attitude. And now with COVID, that loneliness and struggle has suddenly hit me like a truck.

I don't know what to do. What was once difficult now seems impossible. I have something to offer. I am loyal, honest, upfront, willing to change. I try my hardest to be a good person, dream of simply making someone smile at the end of a hard day, or holding someone while they cry and offer support. I want to cuddle someone while we stream a horror movie, and cook them a carrot cake (my specialty) when they have a sweet tooth. I want to introduce them to my sisters and have them learn embarrassing stories from my youth. I want to paint them something just to show them what I can create and hopefully bring them joy. I want love. I want companionship. I want a life friend.

But for starters, I just want a date. A relationship. 

A hope for something more.

But I feel handcuffed by my health. Handcuffed by my mind. And now handcuffed by COVID.

I am posting this not just to seek out help, although advice would always be welcome, whether its suggestions of dating sites, recommendations for how to date in my situation, or ideas for new approaches to the dilemma.

No, I am also posting this because I want folks to understand that there are certainly others out there like me.  Realize how precious finding someone special can be. Realize that COVID is harder on some than others when it comes to dating. Realize that depression can be a real issue and to take a moment to consider others in this time.

I sit here at 12 am (here on the east coast), unable to sleep after a recent surgery and internal pain associated with it, and just hoping beyond hope I find myself lucky enough one day to find someone special. Even if it's just for a fleeting moment that can help bring a bit more hope back into my life.

Because that hope is sorely needed right now.

232,hcz43l,False,Venting,185,Ghosting Girls,dating,"Two times over the last couple months I have been ghosted by two separate girls. The first one, we only went on one date, and it was nice. We got a couple beers, had good conversation, and when saying goodbye, she was the one who first said, ""We should do this again sometime."" Of course I said yes, for sure! She was cute and nice, and i liked her. Texted for the next week or so, ghosted me once, and sent one last hail Mary,  just general like, ""Hey how's your week going"" to try and start a conversation and just completely ghosted. 

The second girl just recently, we were acquaintances through my sister, she was my sister's friend, she found me on bumble, and she began the conversation. We texted for a couple days, I got her number, kept on texting, until we set up a date to meet up. Date went great, she brought some beers, we went on a little hike, good conversation, we kissed the first date, which I normally don't do but it felt so natural. She bought me 16 tall cans of beer at this brewery she works at on the way out (Wife materail) and when we were texting later, she told me she wished I didn't leave so soon. We meet up again a week or so later, go out to dinner, she grabs my hand first while we are walking and we hold hands for the rest of the night. We come back to my house play some games, have a great time. Ends up staying the night (No sex, just other sfuff) get a little morning BJ, make some coffee for her, and kiss her goodbye. Bring her favorite juice to her while she's at work later that week, and she tells me I am the sweetest, and thanks me for being so nice to her. Sends me multiple texts with kiss emojis. 

Fast forward a couple days, we are still texting, little flirting, and one day just generally ask her how she's doing, and no response. I stay cool, give her a couple days, she's still sending me random snaps during this, but I text her again, she responds, but very short, i notice a disconnect. And then I text her just yesterday asking her if she wants to go to this bar she told me she really had been wanting to go to. No response. 

I get if she lost interest, but I am just literally wondering what I did, or didn't do, or if she is just going through something. Literally its like she just changed her mind overnight. Why say all these positive things about me, grab my hand first, ask me if she can stay the night, and just essentially redact all of it seemingly overnight.

234,dal7t6,False,Tinder/Online Dating,261,Some thoughts for guys on dating apps,dating,"In light of the recent Match Group scandal, I think it's time for me to write up some guidelines for guys using dating apps. If you haven't heard, Match Group is an online dating company that owns just about every dating app you have ever heard of. They were accused by the FTC for creating fake profiles to entice users to purchase premium subscriptions. 

Here are some of my thoughts:

* If you've never had a girlfriend or had a woman show interest in you in real life, then forget about dating apps. I have never seen a guy with no success in real life with tons of matches on these apps unless he's catfishing hard. And if you're in a remote area without lots of people to meet IRL, then the apps won't work either because there won't be anyone on there. 

* Never, ever pay for these subscriptions or boosts or whatever they're called unless you already have tons of matches without purchasing them. These things almost NEVER work because the root of the problem is that you're not competitive enough (not attractive enough, not educated enough, not unique enough, etc.). Even if more people see your profile, you will just get more left swipes or get likes from people you wouldn't swipe right on anyways. 

* You need to understand the dating app business model. The longer they keep you on their platform, the higher the probability of you spending money, so it is NOT in their interest to actually match you with suitable people. When you have few matches or low quality matches, you get desperate, and every new match will give you a dopamine boost. They're capitalizing on that addiction. 

* You need to understand the vicious cycle of dating apps for men and women. Men swipe right on everything because they have low numbers of matches and want to maximize their chances. Women become more selective because they now have more choices, which leads to less matches for guys. And the circle goes round and round. Oh, and you also get penalized for swiping right on everyone. 

* Because women have lots of matches from the hordes of thirsty guys, they can leverage their position on these apps to seek validation, find someone to chat with, advertise their Instagram/Snapchat, or sell sex work. I think there was a survey that said the vast majority of women are NOT looking to date seriously on these apps, and they're just curious or bored. 

* For the love of God, don't turn into an incel just because you don't get matches online. I mean, you should never be an incel no matter what, but I see so many guys completely giving up on dating and blaming women because little Timmy only got three matches on his first day on Tinder. Seriously, for all the reasons I've listed above, these apps are NOT a true measure of your attractiveness because on these apps, only the most attractive men are perceived as attractive while guys below that super high threshold is perceived as unattractive. It's essentially a binary view of attractiveness, but attractiveness is more of a bell curve. 

* Dating apps promote convenience, but do they really? Sure, it takes no effort to swipe right on someone, but let's be rational here: what's the conversion rate from a swipe to a date? After the swipe, you have to match, you have to talk, you have to set up a date, and you have to actually go to the date. There can be tons of drop off at any point in that funnel, so when you consider all the effort you spent for that date, are you really better off than just asking in person? And you might say, ""well I'm an introvert and prefer online dating"", but that's not the right excuse. Being an introvert means you don't like to hang around people all the time and talk, but that doesn't mean you can't be confident and ask in real life. 

* A lot of guys turn to dating apps because they don't have many friends or a social circle but still want to date. Thus, the apps seem like their best option, but you need to ask yourself, ""Why don't you have lots of friends?"" Are you really busy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really shy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really unlikable? If so, how is dating gonna work? Or let's talk about the best case scenario where you're a great guy, but you just moved to a new city and don't know anyone. In that case, you certainly should NOT prioritize dating over making friends because if you guys break up, then your social life is back to square one. 

What am I getting at here? Well, here's a metaphor: gambling is fun once in a while, but if you want to make a living, you probably shouldn't stay in the casino. These dating apps are essentially casinos where all the odds are against you and the chances of your success are as good as Jackie Chan not doing kung fu in a movie. I mean, there is now PHYSICAL proof that these companies are trying their best to screw your wallet, and even if they do remove the fake profiles, that's not going to help you one bit because the ecosystem on these apps is already fucked with hundreds of guys vying for one girl's attention, deluding her into thinking she looks like Arwen from LotR while deluding you into thinking you look like Gollum. Personally, I think these apps have done more harm than good on the dating world because they focused on the monetization of desperation rather than building a good product, and I would love to see them all destroyed in the fires of Mt. Doom. Middle Earth references aside, if you've used these apps for the last three months without achieving a single meet-up, then these apps are not for you.

Edit: It looks like a lot of people are asking for an alternative, so I'll provide some feedback here. 

* You need to ask people in real life. I think many guys are afraid of rejection or being called a ""creep"", and so they retreat to apps. When you start asking people out in real life, you may crash and burn, quite painfully, but if the apps aren't working out for you at all and you want a relationship, you need to try something else. To ask someone out in real life, it's probably easiest at a bar/club if you see someone giving you signs such as holding eye contact or smiling. Just strike up a conversation with her and feel her out as a person. If she seems like a cool person, then just ask her for her number. If she gives it to you, great. If she doesn't, say something playful and just leave her alone. Obviously, don't ask a woman if she's not giving you any signs at all. That rarely ends well. 

* Make female friends. Make female friends of your friends. Make female friends at your hobbies. Make female friends in general. You don't have to be attracted to them, but it never hurts to have a network that isn't a sausage fest. Women have women friends, and you bet some of them are single. You can ask your female friends to introduce you to their single friends, or they might even set you guys up without you even asking.

* Here's what I think about being called a creep. Women on Reddit love calling men creepy for approaching them, and this has led many guys to believe that they should never even talk to women. WRONG. Let me paint you a scenario that's actually creepy: a woman is talking with her friends and not minding anyone else, and you somehow shove yourself between her and her friends and say to her ""hey gorgeous, I've been looking at you all night"", and when she asks you to please leave her alone, you ignore that and just keep following her around. Yea, that's fucking creepy. If you can't see that, God help you. Most guys here ARE NOT like that. Most guys here are just a bit shy, a bit awkward, a bit inexperienced, and a bit insecure. I'm sure most of you would never do something like that. If you say ""hi"" to a woman and she immediately says ""ew creep"", that's not on you, that's on her. She's a crass and immature woman with no manners and not worth your time. There's probably a lot of women on Reddit that had poor experiences with being approached by men, either being harassed, stalked, groped, or whatever, so now they believe all men are like that. Don't let them poison your mind. I used to think that Reddit was right and that I should never approach women, but deep in my heart, I knew it was not true that no woman liked to be approached. I only used that as an excuse so that I would never have to approach someone and potentially get rejected. I mean, just ask yourself: for all the single women not on dating apps, how are they supposed to find relationships if no one ever approaches them? We still live in a society where men are expected to approach women rather than the other way around, so to conclude, approaching women is very, very normal.

* I want to thank /u/[Bacon_Square] for this one that I've completely forgotten: go somewhere where you shine. What does this mean? If you're good at sports, go play sports. If you're really funny or musically talented, perform at a show. If you're really smart and successful, go to conferences and give speeches. If you're passionate about anything, SHOW IT OFF. On a dating app, the only thing that separates you from the other guy is typically just your pictures. To a much less extent, your bio. For many people, they cannot really show their strengths in a 2D profile. Some of my bosses are the smartest and most successful guys I have ever met, but if they made a dating profile, I guarantee you they wouldn't get more than 5 matches. Why? Because they can't show off their strongest traits when the comparison criteria is pictures and attractiveness. You need to play to your strengths, and if apps are not bringing out the best in you, then you need to find that outlet. Why do a lot of people like celebrities? Because we all admire someone who stands at the peak of society (also because gold diggers). I'm not saying you have to be a celebrity to find a girlfriend, but do you see how making yourself stand out is really attractive? Not to mention you'll meet people similar to you at places where you frequent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dal7t6/some_thoughts_for_guys_on_dating_apps/,632,"I've been lucky. I've had some success with online dating sites. I've met my last 3 serious girlfriends online. I'm marrying the latest one very soon.

But I had an advantage of studying online dating at University before I trying it out for myself 

Just like a CV. You have to sell yourself. Be positive. Pick the photos people will like to see. Ask female friends to pick out your best ones. Always include a cute one with a pet or a young family member. My best one is a photo with me dressed as Adam Ant with my cousin's four year old daughter cuddling me. (She is very cute.)

Don't put photos showing off your chest or your fancy car or motorbike. You will look like a arsehole and will only attract arseholes.

However, the most important part is how you chat to women on it. Don't just say ""hi"", don't take yourself seriously and, here is the key part, learn to take knock backs. As far as I'm concern, it's her loss if she rejects me and move on.

Before you message someone you like, read her profile and look at her photos. If there anything you like? Is there anything you have in common? (Oh, I've been there on holiday as well - did you visit there as well) Did it make you laugh?  Mention it in your message to her. My main key is that I love to laugh, and I try to protray this in my message to her. Girls are more likely to response if you make them laugh. But if you aren't a funny guy, don't worry. Just be yourself, cat fishers will always be found out. 

Oh and try to be unique to every girl. They can tell if you just copying and pasting the same opening comment. The same joke. The same silly chat up line. (However, they do work if they ask for them in their profile.)

And finally, be patient. If she doesn't reply straight away, don't hound her. Even if she is showing to be online. By hounding her, you are just pushing her away. She might be online deleting all these ""hi"" messages or pushy guys. Be a gent, behave and be patient.

I do believe some people probably have healthy, functional, non-committed relationships. But, I also believe a lot of people (In my case, guys), who are looking for a non-committed relationship online are full of shit. 

Yesterday, I asked a guy what was he looking for after having talked for a bit, and he basically said that he wanted someone he could go to the movies with, eat out, go on dates and have sex,  but not dating seriously.

To me, this just strikes me as ""I want someone who will be in a pseudo relationship with me, but without any sort of emotional responsibility and commitment from my part"". 

&#x200B;

Obviously, after I discussed things with him, he threw in the ""I'm open to a serious relationship with the right person and if things go well between us"", which in my experience, is a complete lie. 

There's a huge difference for me between getting to know someone slowly and see where it goes vs. the pseudo relationship with no commitment these men want. 

I think this sentence is thrown out to reel you in, and make you think there's hope it will develop into something later, but it most likely never will.

If you are looking for a serious relationship, or actually getting to know people, don't fall for this bullshit. It leads nowhere. If a guy says he wants nothing serious, believe him. Even if he acts like he loves you, and takes you on dates. Even if you meet his family. When you ask him where this is going, or if he wants something more, he will deny everything and act like you are crazy, but will try to convince you to stay.

But ask any person in a happy, long term relationship, and they'll tell you there are things about their partner that irritate them. That's just how human relationships work.

My advice: figure out what actually matters to you. What are those things that are legitimate deal breakers? Accept that there will be some things about a potential partner that aren't exactly what you want. It's like buying a house: maybe you don't like kitchen counter tops, but everything else is great and you have a budget so you make it work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gtkhqq/lower_your_standards_and_learn_what_actually/,615,[deleted] ,2020-05-30 19:48:38

247,evbk8d,False,Giving Advice,117,Don't be so quick to conclude that your single-hood is a testament to an inherent unlovable character flaw,dating,"I just wanted to share something I've observed. I've observed a lot of couples and spent some time with people in marriages and relationships etc and I've noticed they are all just human beings, with amazing attributes but also with some pretty obvious flaws. When I come on here I see a lot of posts on this sub where we are all always asking what is wrong with us in an attempt to understand why we're single. But have you actually paid attention to people in relationships enough to come to the conclusion that you can't find love and therefore it must be because you're too flawed to?

As an example, I know a woman through my school's program that we're both in. She is driven, a great conversationalist, and very loving of her husband. All great qualities. But she also loves to whine and complain a lot. And we all whine and complain but I never knew anyone could be so negative until I met this lady. She has complained to me about people in the program, people she's had very little interaction with. She has proclaimed to me during her rants that she thinks everyone in the program is stupid and sh'e smarter than everyone (except me she said of course ;) ). She has purposefully come up to me and the first things she sad was ""Can you share some gossip with me about so and so?"". etc etc. Eventually I began panicking when she'd call and text and I'm glad we are not in touch anymore even though I wish her well.  These characteristics, being negative, complaining, looking down on people etc are humongous red flags, I'd honestly not be very happy dating someone like this let alone marrying them. Yet she is in a wonderful loving marriage with a man who absolutely adores her.

What seeing people like these in relationships has taught me is that a lot of us are single because we are unlucky in dating, and that's just it. when I see posts of people trying to extrapolate why, blaming physical attributes, trying to see their character flaws etc it makes me a little sad because it's self hating but also it's just not reflective of reality. You just have not found your person yet and that is ok. Let's be patient and graceful with ourselves in this process.

Last night he told me he’s decided he actually wants to go travelling again in a few months so can’t get into anything serious anymore but still wants to see me. I did think about maybe just continuing things and seeing how it goes but decided that I am looking for something serious so that wouldn’t be a good idea. I’m about to send him this text, is it ok?

I've been like that my whole life and because of this and a lifetime of bullying I have next to no self-esteem/confidence. As a result, I've never been on a date in my life. I've never had the confidence to put myself out there as I hated myself so much, I couldn't imagine someone liking me. 

Like I said I'm working on myself a lot and that includes mental health as well. I've recently started putting myself out there and exploring the dating world, online anyway. For the last 3 months I've been on all the apps, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, PoF, etc., but haven't had any biters that weren't malicious scammers. Until this week. 

On Bumble I found a girl who, as far as I could tell, incredible. Cute, works in my industry, same taste in comedy, sports, just a ton of stuff in common. And unbelievably, we matched! We messaged back and forth all week, first on Bumble then via text. Things were great. Because of the pandemic, we couldn't exactly go out to dinner, so I asked her if if shed be interested in having dinner over video chat. Again, she said yes! I couldn't believe it. I spent the night/next day prepping the space where I'd sit, setting up lights to make things look better and testing microphones and cameras. I even found a playlist of ambiance music you might hear in a nice restaurant to have slightly playing in the background. I had everything set. And when the time came.... nothing. 

I texted and asked if the time still worked for her. Nothing. I called to see if everything was okay. Nothing. I waited for an hour to go by before I finally gave up and ate my meal alone in my sad setup. Still haven't heard anything from her. 

I don't know if there's much of a point to this post, if not just a way for me to get my feelings out. I just don't know what could have changed in 24 hours to change her mind. I feel like such an idiot. I'm around family right now and all I can do is put on a smile and pretend like nothing happened even though I'm on the constant brink of tears. It feels like a huge smack in the face, a reminder that all the progress I've made ultimately means nothing. I hate myself as much as ever. I don't know why I put myself through this.

EDIT: I just want to sincerely thank everyone for their kind words and support.

252,f1kei3,False,Tinder/Online Dating,158,This is how easy it is to fall for an attempted murderer on an online dating site. Here is how I survived.,dating,"I'll cut right to the chase since one of my personal superpowers is having a short attention span: ask for your potential date's last name, then do your homework. It could save your life.

Now for the cautionary tale. I'm 34, I enjoy long walks on the beach, puppies, etc. I've been on and off dating sites for years because socializing can prove a nightmare for introverts like myself. I'm usually alone (no complaints here, but it definitely will not get you laid), and I have a 99% success rate for being completely unattracted to...most people.

Very recently I decided to try a new strategy: I scrolled through pages and pages of profiles focusing solely on user photographs and waited until, as George Costanza so delicately described: ""it moved."" Now, I'm not saying I waited for it to give a little *twitch* (just in case I lost some of you with that metaphor, we're talking about my naughty bits); I'd long since lost my patience with ""he's *kinda* hot I *guess*"" so I swipe right and ""maybe one day the four lonely hairs of his stache will join forces and blossom into a big beautiful beard....right? If I wait? Like, for a long time?"" Now I've swiped right twice with no plans on engaging either potential date in conversation. Shame on me.

This called for a new plan and it was a simple one at that: I left the chemical complexities to my hormones and only stopped scrolling when I felt the ""if I don't makeout with this person I'll die"" *movement* in my pants. Like a beachcomber looking for buried treasure, I let my crotch be the metal detector that would hopefully lead me to dat booty (for science!).

It worked! He's even hotter in person! Oh, and that accent. And what do we have here, is that...*chemistry?* Do we actually have chemistry?? *And* he has a j-o-b doing the cooooooooolest thing ever?? He laughs at my jokes, and he's tall and handsome and and...what's the catch?

Wait for it.

Our second date went even better: we talked for hours and lost track of time. How cool is that? I went from wondering if there were literal cobwebs in my attic (\*ahem...\*reference to my naughty bits again) to being one-half of two people who spoke at such length that they lost track of time! We spoke on the phone. We spoke in person. We spoke over skype. We texted during movies (and were duly chastised). We were utterly fascinated by each other (or so it seemed). Time flew by. ""Hi"" and ""bye"" became ""good morning"" and ""goodnight"". ""How was your day?"" turned into ""I miss you."" Before I could catch my breath we were texting from the can while in the same apartment (but not on the same can).

Were we in love? Wtf, am I a wizard? Can I read minds? No. I had to ask. Cher is all, ""if you wanna know how he really feels it's in his kiss"" - well it's not, which makes her a beautiful, ageless liar. When I broached the subject we both looked at each other and smiled all toothy and clumsy, nodding our mutual assent. We were in love. And yeah, I did put on ""Finally"" by Cece Peniston and did the arm wave in the bathroom.

It might as well have been etched in stone: I'd be saving my best version of the running man for our first anniversary.

Ten months, two rescue pets, and one tropical vacation later and I begin to notice a few things. Like that I'd never met his family or friends. Never ran into anyone he knew on the street. The people he did say he knew...didn't seem to know *him*. I'll be honest, the introvert in me threw a wild party at the thought of *never* having to attend any family or friend events - but it was to my detriment that i didn't ask any questions about it.

I began to notice he also had mood swings. Pretty unpredictable ones. ""But I'm a woman,"" I remember telling myself, ""we all but invented the mood swing as soon as we were legally allowed to invent things."" I talked to friends and family about it (bless their hearts *and* their bad advice), but all I got was ""you find something wrong with everyone you date"" and ""no one is perfect."" My favorite was, ""you know how men are."" Do I? Because I've known a few of them, and....then I shut my mouth because it was coming from my mother. She legit made me with her body. I'm the reason she'll always have hemorrhoids. If my mother said, ""Baby, I've been shitting rainbows since the 60s and *that* is how I keep my svelte figure."" I'd totally roll with it.

The longer we were together, the more bizarre he behaved. Unanswered questions began piling up. Why didn't I ask them? Because I didn't want to reprise my role as the person who couldn't get a date should my questions lead to a break-up. *Lame.*

Strange occurrences left a bad taste in my mouth, but since they didn't paint the loving picture I wanted to see, I willfully ignored them. Like that time (on my very first ever tropical vacation) that I got pulled in by the tide a bit too far out. You guessed it - I waved my arms and yelled his name like my house was on fire because dang it I was terrified...while he just stared at me. Didn't move. Just stared.

I'm not proud of my willful ignorance. In my defense I just really wanted that ""love of my life"" Eryka Badu promised. Except she was talking about hip hop, folks. It's so very okay for the love of your life to be hip hop.

Less than a year into our relationship and I'm half conscious in an ER after he'd beaten me bad enough to warrant two whole months in a wheelchair. He tried to choke me so many times that I'd actually lost count. I was the sad recipient of some next-level 80s-hardcore-style stomping on places you don't want to know about. And I'm not even telling you the disturbing parts. Whatever you're imagining to fill in the blanks - it was worse. It felt like I was in Silence of the Lambs. On a scale of one to ten, I was at ""it puts the lotion in the basket.""

By the end of that night I had one working arm that I used to drag myself out of our apartment to find someone to call an ambulance (of course he'd taken my phone - it wasn't his first rodeo). While everything that happened put some permanent cracks in my heart, it doesn't make my blood boil as much as this: before the ambulance arrived the cops came for a whole different reason and it had nothing to do with helping me. I thought they were there for me, so I called out to them...and they walked right past me to talk to my former partner.

Using 911 recordings I'd eventually piece together that he'd called them using my phone when I was on the floor - and told them a woman had broken into his apt. Yep. I was actually listening to the guy who said he loved me, the voice I ached to hear all day long, tell the police to search me for weapons

Now, you can't possibly know this, but I'm not a big person and my former partner is on the larger side of the larger side. I thought it was next to impossible for anyone to believe I could overpower someone that big...but my man was so smooth when he spoke to the cops that they searched me for firearms while I was laying on the floor with glass and blood in my hair (spoiler alert: all they found was chapstick...surprise!!!). Had someone not noticed that I was bleeding, there was a chance I'd have spent the night in jail covered in life-threatening injuries. I know you're probably thinking, ""no one would do that to a woman lying beat up on the floor."" But guess what the magic words are? ""Broads. Amirite?? You guys get it. We've all been there. Jesus H. *chicks these days.*..*""* That's all it took. Turns out it's not that uncommon for a perpetrator to be believed over an injured victim. A little research will give you more examples than you care to know about.

Those were probably the most corrupt and morally bankrupt law enforcement officers I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. Their behavior was so flagrantly disgraceful that I didn't even feel the need to play the race card while writing this story. It wasn't a racist act. Those cops were black, brown, white and there was even a ginger. It well surpassed racism on its way to making a complete mockery of everything we consider humane as a *people.* Was it sexist? The officers who wouldn't move the ambulance for almost an hour (because they were still searching me and openly admitted that they weren't sure if they were going to arrest me yet- which is a funny way to answer the question:""Will anyone help me? I need medical attention, I can't breathe"") were all women. 

That's how easy it is for one smooth talking man to fool almost ten professionals. After forty or so minutes they were all still kinda undecided.

When it was all over, naturally I stopped taking his calls - so he threatened to call my friends, family, and former employers to tell them ""what kind of person"" I am. And he did just that. After receiving ""gifts"" from addresses I wasn't familiar with, flowers addressed to me but signed with fake names, phone calls from unknown numbers - I got a restraining order.

He got one that imitated mine two hours later.

So I made a harassment complaint. We now have a matching set.

*This is out of control, why does he keep copying me?? How is he legally ALLOWED to do this?* Well, if the state is suing you for a crime and *you sue the victim for the exact same crime*...the state withdraws its lawsuit.

Why not just drop the whole thing, chalk it up to experience, change my name, and move? I want to. I want to so bad. But I found out he did this to other people (one of whom left the country to get away from him- I wish I was kidding) and he might just keep doing it until he kills somebody (if he hasn't already). I'll be DAMNED if I don't fight the hardest I possibly can so *at the very least* I can get his name put on the domestic violence registry...

...because frankly his penis is too small to make the sex offender registry (zing!). Give it up for comedy folks, it gets people through the hard times. Can I get an amen?

No matter what race, gender, or sexuality - these predators exist. Keep yourself safe and verify their information before meeting anyone from an online dating site. Behind every name on those domestic violence and sex offender registries is a victim who fought back. They showed up at every court hearing, just like I am, so that at the very least *no one else* has to get hurt.

253,fadjou,False,Other,128,Why I like being single,dating,"Yes, I know this is a dating subreddit, but I figured it might help to share the view from the other side.  (I should probably mention that I'm ASD (formerly Asperger's), so my perspective is different from the norm.  YMMV.)

There's a lot to romantic relationships.  Stages, timings, things you should or should not do or say, etc.  Being single means I don't have to worry about or keep track of any of those.  There's the darker side of relationships--manipulation, abuse, cheating, divorce--that I completely avoid.  There's also the perils of dating that I avoid--getting ghosted, getting stood up, being led on, being used, and being stalked or worse.  Being single means that I'm the only one driving, and have full control over how I spend my time and money.  Finally, there's a strong sense of security and stability when you are the only factor in your life.

While I'm sure that ""the right one is out there,"" the cost and risk associated with being in a romantic relationship just isn't worth it for me.  Maybe I'll bump into someone who'll make me reconsider, maybe I'll be one of the lucky few who find ""the one.""  Until then, I have a career to pursue, a house to  buy, competitions to win, a furbaby to raise, and a host of video games to play (so psyched for Cyberpunk!).

TLDR; Being single isn't a curse.  Just like being in a relationship, it has it's own pros and cons.  You can prefer one over the other, and still be happy in both.

Yesterday I posted about my unhealthy obsession with how long it was taking for the guy Im dating to text me back (every 4-5 hours). But I never sat there and thought : WHY am I exhibiting these behaviors? And then another thought came to me... why am I paying so much attention to MY behavior and not HIS?


I was making excuses for him. He’s really busy at work. He’s taking a nap. He’s out with his friends. Which are all valid excuses. But the weren’t why he wasn’t texting me back. He’s just NOT that into me. 


Here’s the thing. We’re all pretty smart. We KNOW what interest looks like. When we start obsessing over someone’s texting/calling patterns and how often they ask us to hang out, it’s because they haven’t been making their interest clear. And with that uncertainty comes the unhealthy, obsessive thinking.

I’ve dated plenty of guys and I know that the ones who are truly interested won’t go a day without texting or calling. They won’t say they’re not ready for a relationship “just yet” when you’ve already been dating for months. Because any person who’s truly interested in you and sees the amazing human being that you are would be so incredibly excited to take you off the market. 

I’m coming to the conclusion that this guy is just not that into me. And I’m going to be strong enough to not message him anymore because I respect myself too much to just be texted or called whenever he feels like it. 

And with that revelation and decision, I realized how much anxiety I’ve been harboring over his behavior for the last 5 days. 

Im intelligent
I’m resilient 
I’m kind
I’m loving

However, other people seem to have me as their exact type. This would make me happy as a clam if I felt even the slightest hint of attraction for them. I couldn't date or sleep with them if I tried because there really is no desire on my end.

257,dn340y,False,Other,71,"I asked him out a second time, got rejected.... no regrets!",dating,"So.. my friend introduced me to his friend earlier this year.

He pinged my DM while I was out of town last month telling me he hadn't seen me in a while and asking if I wanted to catch up sometime. So when I got back, I asked him out to lunch (I'd previously thought he was cute). We ended up having to reschedule to Friday dinner last week, and it was fun - we even went for a few drinks afterwards and I liked a lot of things I learned about him. Unfortunately, he didn't text me much afterwards. Then I got an invite to a Halloween event and was told to bring a date. I pulled together my nerves and asked him if he was free this Saturday night. He said he was free, so I asked if he wanted to my plus one to this thing. He responded saying he had just confirmed on other plans. Ah. Last minute alternative plans. His gentle way of saying no, because let's be real - if someone likes you, they'll prioritize you. To be honest, it stings and my pride took a beating because I was so accustomed to always being the one asked out. But I honestly have no regrets. This was my first time ever asking a guy out. Ultimately it didn't end up great, but I finally understood how it felt to go after someone you wanted versus debating on whether you were attracted enough to someone that wanted you. And it actually didn't feel too bad.

Moral of story: Girls, if you've thought about asking a guy out first but never given it a shot, give it a shot. I won't lie, it's not completely painless. But it gives you a new perspective on how tough it is for a guy when they ask you out and get rejected, you learn to appreciate more the guys that do gather up the guts to ask you out, and it's also really refreshing to actually try going after someone you want.

I've been reading all the comments and I've noticed there are a few comments that suggest that I might be jumping to things in regard to his response. I'll respond to some of those comments below, but for the record I still do think that it was a rejection -  if it wasn't, hopefully this will show some of you guys the variety of answers that a girl will take as a rejection and prevent you from rejecting a girl if you don't mean to!

258,gmvddx,False,Venting,276,Please please take no for an answer.,dating,"I went out with someone on a virtual FaceTime date. He was not my type at all, but I had a good conversation with him for like two hours, then ended. Told him immediately after that I wasn't interested in being romantic, but maybe we could be friends. He says he's not interested in that and asks for another chance. I say no, talk to him about it, and then he accepts...

...Until I wake up to a three-page text message from him asking for me to give him a shot, how I deserve his love, etc. I finally just coldly say I'm not interested and block his number. I am 26 and he is 30 so it's not like we were fucking 16, where that kind of behavior is more normal!!!!

I feel so creeped out and nervous I ~~got a stalker!!!!~~ **will have a stalker based on his behavior.** Anyone dating, please take no for an answer the first time!!!! ESPECIALLY if you're out of college, you should know better. If someone says no, accept it. You won't change their mind, and if they want to be with you, they'll fucking message you!!!!

**Edit:** Getting a lot of responses, including DMs from angry men. Chill out, stop sending me stuff about how I'm so awful, and go outside. Here are some things.

**Dating Time:** Some guys are saying that I ""shouldn't have given him so much time."" My rule with first dates is to always give the person two hours, in case they're nervous, it takes us some time to get our legs, etc.

A lot of guys have messaged me to say that that's not okay, I should know immediately. Uh, **do you get mad at guys who fuck girls on the first date and then ignore them after? No, you don't, and why is that?**

If you're upset that someone would talk to you more on a FIRST DATE to make certain that you're not a good fit, **you are not ready to date people.**

**Attitudes: I've been rejected plenty of times when dating.** It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like. Sometimes, the person doesn't feel chemistry, they liked you but didn't like X or Y, etc. When I was 24, I was severely underweight due to an ED, and a lot of guys I met stopped finding my body attractive. If you are not ready to experience rejection, **you are not ready to date people.**

**The Guy:** He was attractive enough in pictures and over video, but something about him put me off. He seemed to develop romantic obsessions with girls and also mentioned he had a personality disorder and was going off of his meds because he didn't think he needed them any longer. I offered friendship and a clear no after for safety, because I didn't want to offend him and risk my own personal safety. Anyway, I wasn't intellectually or emotionally connecting with him, and I wasn't attracted enough to want to have sex (not that I do that.) Something about him was so creepy.

**Accepting ""No"" For an Answer:** When I broke up with my last boyfriend, he wrote me a long e-mail asking me to stay. That was fine, as we'd been in a long relationship, and I responded. On first dates, you're just getting to know someone. You should accept what the other person wants. Ours was a first date and a video chat, and I told him that I didn't feel romantic interest in him immediately after our date. He didn't accept it, so I even took the time to tell him over the phone the specific reasons I did not want to date him. He didn't accept it again, so I gave him a briefer ""no."" After that, he sent me a letter expressing that he deserved a chance.

**Contents of the Letter:** The only reason I am sending it over DM is because I don't want him to somehow find this post (slim chance, but weirder things have happened!) In the letter, he told me that while he didn't ""need my love"" and had ""plenty of options,"" I should give him a chance because I said I was attracted to him (I did not) and because he felt we had a connection. I should give him the chance **of a relationship** because he thought I was special, and because I am young enough so that my time doesn't matter/I can afford to go out with people I'm not sure about.

**Freedom to send the letter:** I would never show anyone the letter my last boyfriend sent me, because we were in a relationship. If someone I'd been dating for six months sent me the letter, I would not either. If you're going to send a letter that creepy and controlling to someone you **barely know**, you are taking the risk that other people, including police officers and therapists, will see it. **You are also probably not ready to date people.**

**Rejection:**

# As a final note, all of these angry messages have been about how I made him feel bad, and how terrible I am for it. Well, did you even consider how he made me feel? Did you? This was not a good or fun experience for me.

# I feel nervous and upset, and scared about re-entering the world of online dating. I feel nervous about meeting people in person, I feel nervous about saying ""no"" openly albeit politely again, and I feel like my choices won't matter to people I'm going out with.

259,fbdt9d,False,Giving Advice,182,A little effort goes a long way,dating,"Guys, if you really want to stand out to girls, but some effort into your dates. Actually plan something out. 

I met this girl that’s definitely out of my league on tinder a few weeks ago, talked for a while, and eventually decided it was time to actually go on a date. It was (almost) horrible. We just went to her favorite restaurant and planned for a movie afterward. The conversation was too good and we ended up replacing the movie with pie. 

Cut to the second date, tried for dinner and a movie again. Went to a new restaurant in town, the food wasn’t great  and we agreed on a movie. We went and got our candy to sneak into the theater and saw Fantasy Island. 

The third date, earlier this week, I was over the “dinner and movie” plan. She told me her nights off and I went to work, looking up cooking classes, ice skating, painting classes, all of it. I finally decided on a painting class and signed us up. I told her it was a surprise and only told her to wear short sleeves. 

I met up with her a half hour before the class and started taking a walk away from the studio, talking about her likes and dislikes, how she felt about surprises, etc. We basically walked in a giant circle and ended up at the studio that was right next to date #1’s restaurant. She believed that all the work was just for a reservation at the restaurant again before I took an early right into the studio. We had fun and are just waiting on the call for our work to be ready. 

We had dinner afterwards and she told me she had never had anyone put in the effort that I had put in to surprise her and have fun with her. She was impressed that I even made the effort to find something in our small town on a random Thursday night. 

TL;DR - made a reservation at a painting studio, surprised her with it, had fun, had dinner, she told me that no one had ever put in the effort that I did for her.

Edit: for those of you saying it’s a one way street. After the first date the “almost horrible” part was that earlier that day, my card information was stolen and my card was declined.

260,ehrbcl,False,Giving Advice,159,Five Signs That You’re Unapproachable,dating,"Here’s the simple truth. If you’re not projecting an air of approachability, you’re going to fail with women. Unfortunately, most women view a majority of men as being absolutely unapproachable. Read on and I’ll tell you the five biggest reasons why!  


 **1. Not smiling** :  

If you see a woman scowling, does it make you want to approach her? Probably not, as you already get the idea that she’s in a bad mood. 

**2. Avoiding eye contact :**  

Eye contact is the universal signal that you’re into someone. So if we’re looking over in your direction but you never lock eyes with us, then it’s much less likely we’ll approach you. 

**3. Closed body language:** 

The more closed off your body language, the more unapproachable you seem. It might be crossing your arms or legs. Or keeping your hands in your pockets.

**4. Not having fun:** 

This one is mainly relevant if you’re in a social environment e.g. a bar or a party. We’ll naturally gravitate to the men who are clearly having the most fun. Why?

**5. Looking busy:**

We’re socially conditioned to not want to interrupt people who are busy. But most of us these days are doing things to keep from being bored — which also makes us look unapproachable.

5- Basically anything gets you ghosted most of the time anyways. 

Here is the thing. Most girls don't use tinder to meet guys (tinder official stats, not me making that up). So guys invest less and less and less energy into trying to talk.

* Lots of matches on Tinder will never send each other a message, this platform by it's nature is designed to get people talking
* The current apps in the market are inherently superficial and affecting the way we see/value ourselves, I think that you might meet someone you really like that you might otherwise have never considered.
* Giving people the privacy of not having their pictures appear on a dating platform until you've had enough conversation with someone; don't like someone? stop replying and your identity remains anonymous.

I'm 28 and a woman, going through my own single journey and putting myself out there. I've been rejected and hurt over the last 12 years. So much so that I stayed at home during much of my early 20's because I was afraid of rejection. I've gained weight, lost weight, had a gang of cystic acne then it cleared, then I got it again, you get the point. I've also gone through periods of therapy and a few medical issues I needed sorting. 

All in all, it left me deflated. I ended up developing this consistent running anti-mantra in my mind every time I saw an attractive guy in public: *he's married or has a girlfriend, iceskatingjupiter, no way would he be interested in you.* Every time. No matter how illogical or off base it was. I basically developed a really toxic mindset about myself, that I wasn't good enough and there was no point to dating because no one could possibly want to date me. 

It was one of the lowest points in my life. With all of that, I started to work on myself a year ago and get healthy in my mind and body. Nevertheless, I kept wondering whether or not I was *actually ready* to date. I read a lot of advice on here to wait until you have a fulfilled life with hobbies and a good career outside of a relationship before even considering to date, and I internalized that advice. 

It's very sound advice, but I'm wanting to challenge that a bit in 2020. Things are very up in the air for me. I'm between careers, possibly going to grad school, still working on my mental health and everything in between. I agree that waiting to date if you're going through some severe troubles or toxic mindsets would be very helpful. However, I think it would also serve us all to not wait until we have our dream lives to date. You are absolutely enough. You can wait or you can date, it's up to you. As I've realized, my anxiety and depression, while currently moderate, is a lifelong battle. I may never be the weight or size I really want to be. My cystic acne could come back at any change in my diet or medication. These are things that are very hard to control, but I'm sick of waiting.

And we both learned a lot. 

He swiped right on a lot of guys that I normally swipe left on...and in the following days I learned that a bunch of them were actually super cool, leading me to resolve to be less picky in the future. Also learned that there were some guys that I should just keep trusting my gut and swipe left on.

I also learned that you can run out of likes, which I didn't know before haha.

Asking the question ""would this woman be cute and interesting enough to date my best friend?"" meant that a lot of women made the cut, which was interesting to me. 

Last thing I learned was how genuinely shitty it feels to use up all your likes and only get one match. He told me that it was something of a miracle that I even got that single match for him.

But since I've been dating for the past year or so I've realized I actually got pretty conservative views about dating and relationships. Maybe I cause a shit storm with this one, maybe not. 

From my experience,  the dating game today shuns commitment and encourages disposability: if this one doesn't feel good there's always next, and the next, and the..

I've for example met a woman my age who had never been in a real relationship. To be honest, I wouldn't want to be her first partner, knowing how much there is to learn in order to build a working relationship. 

I've gone through a 8 year relationship, the breakup (3 years ago) and the following anguish. Looking back, it was one of the best thing that ever happened to me.  Learned so much about myself and now I know how important it is to put effort into a relationship, in order to build it strong.

What I am coming at is that many people are so into the disposable dating culture that they've forgot (or never even known) that a real, deep relationship takes a lot of work. And the work never really stops. Yet for this exact same reason it is so much more fulfilling than those one month going-out-but-never-really-getting-to-know-you-cuz-I-just-want-to-have-fun. To me this communicates insecurity and fear of commitment.

I feel like this is one major reason why people are so disconnected from each other and themselves. A proper relationship, which by definition always ends in tears (either death or break up), will teach the partners much about themselves and each other. It won't be easy, but in the end it will either be helluva lot better than being alone or it'll be another valuable, yet painfull life lesson. No commitment = no stakes = no winnings. A bit shaky metaphor, but you get my point.

And this basic principle hasn’t changed except for the fact that with birth control she doesn’t have the risk of potentially having a kid afterwards which takes a lot of time and energy. Basically making marriage and any other form of long term relationship obsolete.

Being around people is so much easier now that my main goal for the night is simply to have a good time with no agenda, and surprise surprise, I’m getting some interest from girls now. 

Moral of the story is, I don’t give a fuck how long you’ve been single for. The only people that do are family members. I was single for 5 years, longer when you consider the only relationship before that 5 years was a month long. Go out and have fun with your friends. Doesn’t have to be a club either, just have fun whatever you’re doing. Forget about girls. It seems counter intuitive but think about what they’re seeing. The weird guy sitting in the corner looking nervous or the guy having a good time, laughing, smiling, you get the picture. Go and have a good time guys. You’ll start to enjoy life a lot more and maybe get a bit of interest.

Oh god, I can't relate to anything harder than this. Ever since i've switched cities, i've been kind of lonely and often times there's this urge to actually find a girl which prompts me to go social events and even bars/clubs by myself with the sole intention of finding a girl, and every I go, I leave the place with a sense of disappointment cause I am either nervous to initiate a conversation with someone that seems attractive or I am just clearly not being myself and having fun.

1. You can’t catfish

3. You spend way less time overall - no swiping, messaging folks part interested. You could still have that while following up with someone after a speed date, but such cases should be less.

I’m surprised Tinder/Bumble haven’t jumped on this already - they could rebrand it if speed dating is seen as something from the past. I know the league does it, but their CX is crap tbh.

A major decline followed.

One major reason for this is that dating, female body and sex has been grossly devalued. Remember how excited Bud Bundy from ""Married with Children"" was when he saw a woman in a bikini in a magazine?  This was a big deal. In the age of easily accessible porn of any kind, posing in front of the Instagram, and tinder - there is not much to look forward to discovering. By 15-16 most guys and women have seen it all, even if they haven't tried it all. Instead of obsessing over one or two people and wondering how to come up with the guts to call her and ask her out and what to say, people click and text on dozens of people at the same time.     

The incentive to date and try hard to impress, attract and be attractive is not what it used to be just 20 years ago. 

I think it's a terrible development as it took the most fun parts of a young person's life out of the equation and younger people have no idea what they are missing out on. My only hope is that this problem is still regional and it's more severe in some parts of the US or world than others.

277,chi1a0,False,Giving Advice,176,Probably the number one situation that people ask me about (as a dating coach).,dating,"This has come up so often, and I see it come up here so often, that I felt it would be prudent to discuss it quick.

The number one thing people seem to ask about is what it means when someone doesn't reach out often, only replies when replied to, makes excuses such as being busy, or if they should reach out if the person isn't being very attentive, or has ghosted in some way (or all the way).

Let me make this very clear to all of you: This means they're not interested.

This is literally rule number one in dating: If a person is into you, they will reach out. No matter how busy they are, they will find the time. They will wake up saying good morning to you, and they will go to sleep saying goodnight. The more into you they are, the more they will shower you in attention. Even people who don't normally do that still will for the right person. It's undeniable, and anyone who claims they have never done that to anyone before--well, you've never met someone you've been super into then.

I've seen the same people have huge interest who reach out a ton, who suddenly lose interest and hardly reach out at all. The correlation is almost perfect, and it's basically a 100% thing. I've yet to meet an outlier on this one. I've HEARD people claim to be, then noted them acting this out to the letter. I've concluded this is just human nature, straight up simple end of story.

Everyone does this. I have seen people who never do this suddenly do this, exclaiming that they had never felt that way about someone before. When someone blows you away, you will behave like this. I don't care if you're 16 or 46--you'll do it.

When someone begins to fade, the easiest experiment you can do to find out if they're still interested in stop reaching out. If you feel like you're doing all of the initiating of contact/dates, then stop reaching out entirely. If by 2-3 days you haven't heard from them at all, remove them from the dating app you're likely on, and remove their number from your phone, because they're slow fading and you're about to have your time wasted.

Move on. Talk to 5 people at the same time--or 10 if you have to. Set up a date with someone different every day of the week if you can get away with it. This stuff is almost completely a numbers game. Eventually you just meet people who are more into you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/chi1a0/probably_the_number_one_situation_that_people_ask/,566,"You will know the one.

You will have no fear when you meet the one because it will be perfect harmony. Everything will click. You will feel like you would kill someone to protect them as a guy. Women probably will see your children already. I don't know, I am not a woman. I have been close to TRUE love though. It was just a glimpse God gave me to understand it wasn't me that was just a chicken. I just didn't want to lie to women. It was never right.

If those profiles were  written in this format: ""Looking for a man 6 feet or taller"" then I  wouldn't have been inspired to make this post. In a single 10 minute  swiping session, I came across these profiles:

2: ""I'm a heightist. If you're 5' anything then swipe left.""

279,dqwf6p,False,Other,200,You do need significant others.,dating,"I wrote this out as a response to a very common comment I see in subreddits like this one where the commenter tells the poster that they shouldn’t need a significant other to be happy and that their sense of self worth should be higher. I understand that some people can function alone, but the average person cannot. Anyway, it’s a long post, but I think it’s worth saying.

Insinuating or explicitly saying that people should be happy alone is a lot of bullshit that metaphorically blind people perpetuate. The truth is that finding a significant other is an enormous part of the average person’s life; it is a constant in every culture around the world. In fact we are driven by a biological imperative to look for a significant other and in this sense, it is truly a necessity. Perhaps not in the way that water or oxygen is a necessity but more akin to needing a warm and safe place to call home. Ultimately we are slaves to the chemical signalling that drives our human machine.

Furthermore, what really is self worth? It seems like a common misconception is that self worth is determined solely by oneself in a vacuum (metaphorical), when in fact your sense of self is an object moulded by all the feedback from your environment. No one is born who they are and it doesn’t matter if you think you’re the greatest thing since sliced bread unless your environment gives you feedback to let you know it’s true. And as it turns out, one of the most rewarding feedbacks you receive from your environment is the affection of a significant other. It is validation of what you might have already hypothesized about yourself, but could not have possibly known to be true until verified. My point is that we really do need affection and significant others in our lives; the way that we are treated in society is important and determines how we fit in and function.

I understand that these things are complex issues without black and white answers. In fact, these things probably fall into a bell curve somewhere, but what we understand so far about humans tells us that the average person does in fact need a significant other/s as a necessity and cannot function alone. Functioning alone is actually a joke; everything we know about our biology tells us that we weren’t designed (metaphorically) to function alone. So can we please stop telling each other lies and minimizing the real frustrations that people post about. Maybe then we can actually solve problems and move forward instead of pretending like everything is perfect.

EDIT DISCLAIMER:
I understand that I am posting an edit to this post long after the thread's burial; originally I started going through the various replies and worked on writing an edit to further clarify and offer rebuttals to arguments posted in the comments. However, I was quickly overwhelmed and ultimately it felt like replying would probably be more work than it's worth. However today, I came across the document I used to write my responses and I wanted to delete it without letting the words go to complete waste. So below are my edits to try to respond to some of the concerns in the comment section. 

Edit 1:
It seems like there is some clarity required as to the definition for *need*; the definition that I used was based on human requirements that would cause large (subjective) amount of pain if left unfulfilled. It seems to me like a lot of the commenters to this post would only consider something a need if it would cause death if left unfulfilled. Herein lies some fundamental problems.

Edit 2:
With a more established definition of what *need* means, we can now look at some of the concerns regarding individuals that continue to argue that one does not need a significant other in their lives to be happy or fulfilled. Again, when concerning the average person, the want to have a significant other in their lives is a need because it is biologically driven; when left unfulfilled, it causes a great deal of pain (to the average person). The systems that drive humans to want to be with significant others is similar to the systems that reward us for eating calories and nutrients; evolution has shaped our biology to feel pain and happiness as a mechanism to control our actions to move towards the larger goal of the survival of our species.

A caveat to this argument though is that while companionship is a need, there are no laws in the universe that say that each human person will find at least one significant other. The world of biology does not operate this way at all and in fact natural selection is a key factor in ensuring the survival of species in general. So unfortunately, it is definitely possible that you can search your entire life for your significant other and still come out empty handed. The natural world doesn't care about pain and hurt feelings. However, this aspect of human interaction can be seen as a key driving factor for trying your hardest to stand out and excel as an individual.

I understand that all of these statements make it seem as though procreation is the ultimate goal for human individuals. While I'd be at a loss to argue against that since logically there can be no goal greater than existence itself, I want to stress again that this only applies to the average person; it would be entirely possible for individuals to live happy lives alone (I have known one such person), but it definitely cannot be the norm since if everyone decided to live alone, it would ultimately lead to the demise of the species and thus breaking the fundamental goal that our biology is attempting to optimize.

Edit 3:
Answering some of the comments arguing against my post requires a deeper look at human purpose in life. A lot of people draw purpose from religions and also create their own purposes and goals for their lives; I understand the appeal and while I would never try to take it away from anyone, the truth is that religions are all based on things that cannot be directly observed or proved and self prescribed purpose is by definition made up. I am of the opinion that there is no observable purpose to life in the large scheme of things; we exist, the universe exists as we see it and nothing more. But at the micro level, biological beings do have an observable purpose, especially if we allow form to dictate function. We observe through out the animal kingdom that life's purpose seems to be to continue to ensure existence, that is to say that each species seems to be optimizing for its own continued survival. And since humans are also animals, one of our most fundamental concerns in life is to ensure the survival of our genetic material. Again, this would only apply to the average person, since deviations from the norm cannot account for the larger goals of the species.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dqwf6p/you_do_need_significant_others/,561,"The fact that so many people liked this post is scary.

Before you say it, I dress conservatively and I honestly don’t sleep around. I don’t throw my self at guys, and I’m not even on dating apps. I’ve only ever “dated” three guys in my life. With that being said, I’ve still had the bad luck of only meeting people who only like me for my looks. They’re not even your typical player types - they start out really nice. But eventually they stop even trying to get to know me or my personality. It’s not like I’m dumb or boring - I have a master’s in Economics and have hobbies outside of that. But no matter how educated/interesting I could be, nobody wants to get to know me for who I am. Interestingly enough, even though I’ve made it clear that I won’t sleep with someone unless I’m in a relationship, these guys still keep inviting me over to only makeout with them, and then they brag about it to their friends.

To me this is weird because if sex isn’t on the table and they don’t want to be involved with me on a personal/emotional/serious level, then why stick around for just making out (its not like we’re high schoolers)? I’m 27, and these guys have all been either my age or older. They could easily not get involved with me and go sleep around with everyone else, so why bother? But I digress. Long story short, nobody cares about me as a person - they only care about my looks. I feel like I’m in a limbo; people want to ""date"" me and I have tons of options, but eventually all anyone cares about is how I look and how I make them look to their friends. I don't even feel like dating anymore, because I feel like its just going to be the same thing over and over again - guys only want to keep seeing me because I'm they find me attractive. 

It all feels so fake, and I feel completely disillusioned. Honestly, sometimes I think it would be better to be average looking/not attractive, because at least then you'd know from the get-go that the person you're dating is interested in your personality (I don't mean that hurtfully). I don’t think most people understand how bad it hurts to only be desired for your looks. I feel like nobody will ever want to be a companion to me. I’m happy and secure in myself and being single, but I’m still very lonely and want a boyfriend who sees past my looks. (Also, when I was in grad school, there were a few girls in my cohort who were like gorgeous. They were in serious relationships with guys who loved them and wanted them, so I know its possible. I just don't understand why it hasn't happened for me yet, especially since I really liked all three of those guys I dated).

Had a really nice date last night and at the end he said how he had a great time. When we hugged goodbye he said ""So, I would normally try to play coy, but I would really like to see you again. Do you want to XX on Monday night?"" (It was an activity we talked about during the date).

It was nice after this other guy making me feel like shit basically to just be like you know what, I *am* a catch and the right guy *will* make the time for me and be excited about me. It was also refreshing for someone not to play games and give the green light to I'M INTERESTED.

In relationships, it’s OK to have needs within reason and anyone you’re in a relationship with that tells you they can’t meet them, just isn’t the person for you and that doesn’t make you needy. 

I think that’s separate and apart from people who use love as escapism and put heavy demands on a person because they hope it will make them happy internally. Another person can’t be responsible for making you happy, but another person can play a role in bringing joy to your life.

I find many women with low self-esteem question whether they are asking for too much and in reality they are asking for the bare minimum. That’s not needy. You’re just dating someone who is unwilling or can’t meet those needs. 

The last guy I dated I said “hey I like to talk on the phone sometimes” and he had excuses why he couldn’t, not even one day. I almost reverted back into my old thinking of ""maybe I am asking too much?"" No, I’m not and it’s not needy.

I'm 24 years old and this **is the first time I've EVER asked a girl out outside of a dating app**. I made a post on /r/dating_advice last week under an alt account, asking for advice on ***if*** I should be asking this girl out. What if I'm not her type? What if she says no? Will it be awkward? What if I mess up? But then as I was typing the post out I realized that the only way I'd ever get the answer to any of those questions was to *ask her out and find out for myself*. What the fuck was I doing asking strangers on the internet for? 

And so I did it! I was in class with my crush for all of today and I kept looking at her dreaming of finally asking her on a date. I was going to let her slide by as I always do. I came up with my usual excuses. I haven't shaved recently and I look unkempt. I'm not dressed well enough later I'll ask her when I look better. She doesn't know you, become her friend first. She's busy with class right now leave her alone!

But then at the end of class I noticed that she was staying behind to pack up her bag after talking to the professor. She was walking towards the exit and I was too so I held the door for her and just said ""Hey!"" awkwardly as I let her through. She said some greeting in return and then started to walk down the hall in the opposite direction. 

And then I could just feel something come over me. It was the perfect time. She's all alone! You don't have to embarrass yourself in front of your classmates! It's the perfect opportunity are you going to let her pass you by again!? Do it!!! And so I jogged after her down the hall and called out her name. It was awkward as I've never really spoken to her before! I just introduced myself and asked her if she wanted to grab some coffee later this week? I tripped over my words a bit and it didn't come out the way I always imagined it. My heart was pounding and my legs felt like jelly! Still she said YES!! 

I still can't believe it. The whole thing took like 90 seconds. I've gone through 4 years of college and I've NEVER been brave enough to approach a girl in person. Hell I've only gone on like 3 dates in my entire life! I can't believe that all it really required was about a minute or two of pure courage. 

I'm trying not to get too excited as I don't even know her yet (who knows if we're even compatible with each other) but I'm still hopeful! I wish I had done this years ago, I feel so empowered right now!

She thought it'd be cute/funny to swipe and match with me, but it took her a few days of swiping before she even found me, and we don't even live in a big city.

There's a reason why so many of them seem identical to one another (how many girls have you seen that love wine, tacos, travel, etc?). When I was younger (in my early to mid 20s) I'd think ""Damn, this girl is interesting and does a lot of cool shit"", but then show up to the date and find out they're really not. A lot of these people buy their own hype and aren't any better than you are. It gets less frustrating when you realize that, as cute as someone might be, they're dime-a-dozen

3) Don't assume that dating is easier for good looking people - we still have to deal with the same problems anyone else does. I'm a handsome, fit guy with his life in order and a bright future. I get a decent amount of (good) matches given how shitty the options are around me. Do you know how many girls actually follow through on meeting up? Very few. To give you an example, last week I was supposed to have five dates. I only ended up going on one (one of them was canceled by me though, after I found out the girl was using old pics and looked different from her profile)

4) This one is for the guys, though I'm sure girls have experienced this too. If there's any piece of dating advice I repeat the most, it's this: a lot of the girls on dating apps have no intention of actually meeting up. They're just attention starved, and dating apps are an incredibly easy way to get that attention. Why do you think you see so many profiles with maybe a sentence or two at most and then their Instagram/Snapchat handles? They don't want you, or anyone else for that matter. They want your attention. And yeah, I know, ""Well they'd go out with you if you had model looks and were rich"". You're probably right, but: 1) That kind of dude isn't gonna settle for generic Tinder thot, and 2) why would you want to be with someone like that anyways?

5) Think of dating from an economic standpoint: what you get is what you're able to add to the (dating) economy. In other words, you will get the equivalent of what you're offering. And no, there's no such thing as ""fair"" - dating is amoral

6) The other piece of advice I repeat a lot: most of the people actually worth dating aren't on an app. Yes, there are exceptions, but by and large apps aren't the place to be to find anything more than a date or two or something casual

7) Get better at in-person interactions. I've noticed that A TON of people are smart, funny, witty, whatever they want to be behind their phone's screen, but face-to-face they're just average. For the longest time I felt like I had no clue what I was doing when it came to talking to girls on Tinder, and then I realized it's because talking over a screen when first meeting someone is awkward, especially when they don't give you much to work with. I also knew that I was much better where it counted: in-person. Don't be fooled by people who seem amazing over an app - it's easy to build a persona and sell a persona that isn't representative of reality

8) That person you were talking to that randomly ghosted you, even though it seemed like things were going well? You haven't lost anything. Truth is, they either a) don't actually know what they want, or b) just want attention. There's a reason why you see a lot of the same people consistently on dating apps over the years

9) A lot of people, guys and girls, have unrealistic expectations. Sure, that girl might pass on you because you're not six feet tall with a killer body and amazing career, but focus on what's really important here: none of those people are dating her, or are going to date her. Yes, it stings when you get passed up for shallow things like that, but realize that, at the end of the day, those people are still single, and will eventually have to settle. I got passed over a ton when I was younger; now when I see those girls and who they actually ended up with, I feel a lot better about myself

287,dss5ru,False,Giving Advice,105,This sub is super depressing,dating,"Every post I see is “woe is me” and it made me realize two things. 
1. There are more hopeless guys and gals out there who are going through the same struggle. 
2. After reading other hopeless posts from an outside perspective, I realized how pathetic my behavior has been. 

With that said, I think this sub really opened my eyes and made me realize that life isn’t fair. Some of us have to try harder than others. If you yourself aren’t particularly attractive but want an attractive partner, you gotta fight for him/her. It’s like anything in life. Shit doesn’t simply get handed to you. You have to earn it. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is “thank you”? Thank you for showing me how I could end up if I don’t get self-confidence, take risks and step out of my comfort zone albeit without compromising my values and principles. 

I hope others who are lonely and hopeless can eventually have the same outlook.

Edit: a user has misinterpreted the phrase “fight for him/her”. The word fight is another way of saying one needs to make the effort whether that be battling one’s own insecurities, stepping out of his or her comfort zone, etc.

I (23F) met this guy on tinder a few weeks back. After a fortnight of texting, sexting, sending photos, we agreed on a date to meet. He was really excited and told me multiples times how he « could not wait ». 
Which happened. We met. 
Guy arrives at my house and we have a nice little chat for about an hour. Honestly I think it was going well. No sloppy subjects, no blanks in the conversation, he looked relaxed and so did I. Then he suddenly hits me with:
« Okay. I don’t want to be here. It pisses me off. I’m leaving. ». I was so, so, so surprised. We were having a chat, and right in the middle of it, he just... said that. 


And there goes my fucking rant: you have every right to feel uncomfortable and every right to leave, I left many dates myself. But I always managed to do it in the most tactful way and polite manner (like: « Sorry, I don’t think this is working, I’ll be leaving now. Thanks for the night »)

I can handle rejection, but what I can’t handle is feeling like shit because my date is leaving w/o explanations and in the rudest way possible.
It happened yesterday, and I’ve spent all day and most part of the night wondering if I did something wrong to deserve such a nasty comment.

292,dvq4hr,False,Giving Advice,123,If you're not into someone just tell them!,dating,"So one thing I've been dealing with while dating is when someone realises you're not the person for them but then string you along for ages and ages.

It's much less hurtful to be told ""I'm just not that into you"" than feel like you're fighting a losing battle trying to keep someone you never had. Leaving morsels of ""maybe in a few months"", ""I'm not ready yet"", and getting drunk and sending messages about how much you like us is confusing and hurts more in the long run. 

This isn't only for men or women... everyone should take this advice. In trying not to hurt someones feelings, instead you're giving them hope where there is none. You're letting someone hang on to you knowing you won't take it further. 

Sure, in that moment, the rejection sucks. But a definitive answer means I can start moving on. Telling me ""if we met at a different time, things would be different"" just makes me want to wait a few months and try again and that's totally not fair if you're just not interested.

I know some people will say, well if you know they're stringing you along then why put up with it? And the reason is because all logic and sanity seems to go out of the window when you genuinely like someone. You want it to work so you make excuses and even if you tell yourself that theres always a part of you that wonders what could have been. Was the person being genuine? Could it have worked out if you were just a bit more patient?

It's so unnecessary to keep hurting someone because you don't  wanna deal with upsetting someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dvq4hr/if_youre_not_into_someone_just_tell_them/,539,"Why is there so much pressure on the person you like to be the one to deliver the rejection? 

I understand that if you like someone, you think about them a lot and they are an important part of your life. But if someone has an unrequited crush on you, maybe you don't think about them much at all.
If you haven't done anything romantic with this person, why should you have to instigate an uncomfortable potentially dangerous conversation?
A crush can be amazing or it can be messy. 
You need to ask your crush 'Do you like me/Will you date me?' 
If they respond with 'No', then respect it and deal with it however you think is best for you, but there shouldn't be expectations on the other person anymore to behave in any particular way. And similarly if the answer is 'maybe' or 'in the future' then decide on your OWN whether the uncertainty is still worth it for you. They are entitled to their own indecisiveness, but you can only control what YOU decide to do. 
Let them carry on with their lives without walking on eggshells, worried about potentially 'leading you on' again. 

It's annoying when people are painted with the brush of 'hurting people...playing with their feelings...enjoying the attention of being liked' etc. It isn't their job to find the best words to let you down, at the right time in the right way. ",2019-11-13 10:53:23

Within an hour that first match messaged me, telling me that I had slimmed down and was flirting with me, actually fun to talk to again.

I was at a street fair/festival this afternoon. Mind you, I’ve never been in this city and I’m here for several days for work. I wanted to check out the fair. Very crowded and hot. I was standing at a pub table watching the next band set up their equipment. Just hanging out and people watching. 

I noticed a man in front of me who looked appealing. He seemed alone, so I got his attention and asked if he was solo. He was, so I invited him to post up and share my table (a place to set his beer, etc). 

We had a very nice chat and he asked me out to dinner. Simple as that. 

We exchanged numbers and have plans for him to take me to dinner later or tomorrow night (depends on my work schedule). 

He gave me his full name and place of employment (so I can look him up and make sure he’s not a creep — his suggestion).

First i chatted with him nicely for about a week. After that he really made some exceptional and weird demands and remarks to me. And that is why i at a certain point stopped any contact with him.
Basically this is what he wanted. He wanted to date but i have to go to his town and take the train because his car was in the garage. He didnt want to come to me/my town because for him it was 30/45 minutes walking to the train station and otherwise he would have to take the bus that don't run that often in his area. 

He wanted a guarantee we would have sex on the first date. 
Then when I explained i wouldn't do that (of course) he said that he can fuck any of his fwb's any day of the week, so it would have to be a yes please for me or a no (i guess he expected me to feel lucky or thankfull or something).

And he made this comment i was quite average looking of all the women he had dated/had sex with.

After all this i stopped any contact with him but then he messaged me again this week if i want to fuck. 
I mean how weird and unrealistic are his expectations????

Edit; 
The first week he showed normal behaviour and was a nice guy. When it came to meeting he said all tbat stuff.

I wasn’t going to post this but I think that it might give some insight even just a tiny bit into why some men “leave after sex”.  I’ve seen many posts about women wondering why the man only wanted sex and everything was fine before sex etc on here so I just wanted to give a little bit of “biology fun fact” type of information on the male and female brain during sex. **Im not an expert by any means** but I am a biology enthusiast going for her doctorate now (not a biologist though) so I’ve read up on this a little bit enough to post this information here which might give some insight to some situations which I think could potentially a tiny bit helpful or interesting.

—————————————————

**Edit: DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert biologist specializing in this topic.** However, the studies I've read and information on hormones is public information. Do your own research please as well. 

**My point for this post was to give/add a different perspective on sex on this subreddit.** There are many variables and every human is different. There are also different situations and nuances. 

—————————————————

**TLDR:** When a man and woman have sex, oxytocin is released. Women feel this “cuddle hormone” and men don’t because their high level of testosterone blocks it. A man's vasopressin (lust and attraction hormone) that had been building up for the woman prior also drops after sex. 

This hormone allows women to feel closer and good about her relationship with the man. Whereas the man hasn’t felt that at all, and due to the dropped vasopressin and not feeling oxytocin, he will move on to spread his seed. 

Only when a man has true feelings for a woman and he makes the decision to commit/be vulnerable/let his guard down with her, his testosterone drops enough to feel oxytocin. This is when the man and woman both feel oxytocin and bond and both “make love”. Oxytocin gives feelings of trust, love, etc.

**PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO by an expert biologist who says everything I'm saying with references and study data:**  **Dawn Maslar’s Ted Talk** - which sums this information up perfectly in short video form (called: ""How Your Brain Falls In Love"")

—————————————————

**Longer Version**

This is the cuddle hormone and for women, it skyrockets during sex. This hormone comes out when a woman is giving birth and having sex etc. it makes the woman feel bonded to the man and more trusting and closer to him (and her baby during pregnancy).

The high level of testosterone in men blocks the effects of oxytocin. He does not feel those same effects of a closer bond with the woman (there are exceptions, more on them later).

In fact, vasopressin in men builds as he feels sexual attraction for a woman like when dating her, seeing her, being in anticipation, etc (lust, attraction, affiliation hormone). But immediately after sex, his vasopressin buildup for the woman drops. And testosterone blocks oxytocin.

So therefore after sex, the woman is feeling closer to the man and good about the relationship. 

Whereas a man's vasopressin buildup for the woman has dropped and he hasn’t felt the effects of oxytocin at all. Due to biology, if he didn’t have feelings for the woman, it is in his nature to continue to spread his seed elsewhere. 

**HOWEVER, THIS IS THE EXCEPTION: when a man HAS FEELINGS for and/or LOVES a woman** and decides he wants to commit/be with her in his mind, his **testosterone levels DROP when he lets his guard down and makes the decision to be vulnerable to her**, allowing him to feel the same in love, bond, trust feelings of the oxytocin hormone as the woman does during sex. 

Due to the lowered level of testosterone, oxytocin is now able to work and that is when a man is able to “make love” to the woman and feel all of the oxytocin hormone.

I went out to a bar with a woman I met on tinder. Things were going great, we both were having a great time, lots of sparks in our eyes, touching each others hands, smiling, conversation was flowing. So after 5 hours of non stop talk, its getting late and we both have to catch the last subway. So I ask the barperson if we can get the bill. I ask for two of them.

At that point the bartender sees this happening and come over to make sure everything is okay, and she ask him for 1 bill only (that I would pay). He looks at me and I ask him for two, and he leaves a little confused. 

We then talked a little and I tried to joke around to release the tension, and she told me that if I paid, wed go to my place after.

The fantasy they created of you probably was killed by reality.,dating,"Reposted because it got deleted. Feel others should see this and hopefully not be so hard on yourself. 

Ever have someone all in for awhile and then consistency changes? Yeah that’s probably what happened. 

I assume I potentially “killed” someone’s fantasy. I’m truly having a rough time and this person helped a lot to keep my mind settled. My natural assumption when consistency changes is “I fkd it up and prepare yourself to never hear from them again.” I used to spend years beating myself up. Every time it happened. Because it was so rare for me to connect on many levels. 

Honestly it should be rare. You shouldn’t be connecting with everyone you talk to romantically. I caught myself recently doing this. Then telling myself “I shouldn’t have to try so hard to keep someone in my life.” If they want to go let them. If they stop responding oh well. If they want to talk they will. 

Sending them a bunch of text will just make it worse. I have a horrible habit of over sharing, jumping too far ahead, rushing things. I get overly excited and talk too much. I then get relaxed. It’s something I need to improve on. I care deeply when I care. You might not be as important or “irreplaceable” to them as they are to you. 

 If you have never watched “the price of admission” on YouTube it’s something you should check out. Sometimes we build someone up so much that we think (and hope) they are a certain way. This tends to lead to being disappointed. I try to stay open minded now and let the person open up. Truly see how they are. Not who I want them to be. 

So you’re very caring. Not everyone is that way. Not everyone has a good heart, good intentions for you, or is right for you. Sadly someone may be responding because they are nice. They may just like having someone to talk to. Especially if you haven’t met in person. Take it for what it is. A good conversation. Sadly it’s just how it is now. They may like you as a person, but not as a romantic partner. They may be working up the courage to tell you. They may never tell you. 

Some people also don’t know how truly rare it is to connect with someone on the majority of levels romantically, sexually, and conversation wise. It’s ok if you killed the fantasy they had of you. If they truly wanted you and you fit with them they wouldn’t be so quick to jump ship. Enjoy things while they last. None of us are perfect. Just don’t build a fantasy so high that no one can ever reach it.

Trust me, even for someone who works with people a lot (and should probably know to “read” people better), it is difficult to separate our own biases from our interactions with others. We process information through our own prism of values, beliefs, and hopes. Unfortunately, the more we long for companionship and connection, the more we like to look for clues that support our inherent bias.

325,9ujdfl,False,Venting,94,PSA to you lonely redditors out there: it’s better to be lonely than to settle,dating,"I’m posting this because I’m lonely. But I’m happy to be lonely. I was in a relationship with someone who I ultimately settled for because I was just so lonely and I wanted to know what it was like to be “in love” and to have a long lasting relationship.

But I was wrong. I thought I was in love, I tried to convince myself I was in love.. but I wasn’t. I watched the other couples in my life and I knew deep down that we didn’t have the same love they did. They fit perfectly together, always sat next to each other, were protective of each other. Sometimes I would even forget my SO was in a room. I would compare him to other guys. And I felt so so guilty about it but I told myself to push down those feelings. And I did for a long time.

When I finally got the courage to break it off I felt like the worst person in the world. I felt selfish. I felt disgusting. But I had to remind myself that I’m a human being. And sometimes it’s okay to sort out your feelings and act accordingly.

But I also felt free. I felt like I was giving myself the opportunity to find real, true love. The love people write about. I want that for myself. Right now I’m lonely, I miss what I had with my SO, being held and told I was loved. But I’d rather be lonely and looking than loved and settling. I’d rather go on 1000 crappy dates trying to find the one for me. I’d rather agonize over asking someone out and wondering if they like me. 

Because at the end of the day, no one deserves to settle. And no one deserves the kind of love someone gives when they are settling. 

So I’m writing this to let all of the lonely people out there to know: don’t settle. Loneliness sucks but trust me, settling is so, so much worse. And love is worth the wait.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/9ujdfl/psa_to_you_lonely_redditors_out_there_its_better/,500,I had to learn this lesson the hard way ,2018-11-06 00:30:24
326,bvsua9,False,Giving Advice,72,To all the sad and lonely singles out there,dating,"Date and treat the f**k out of yourself, and do it often.

I too feel the void at times, especially now that it’s summer and I have more free time, but I’m filling it with things that make me happy.

I used to want to do so many first things with my eventual first SO, but I’m 21 going on 22 and I’m not going to put my life on hold.

While I’m waiting to meet that special guy I’m doing all the things I’d want to do with a partner.

Today I went strawberry picking with a friend and tonight I drove down by myself to a really cozy college town in my state. I’ve been craving this particular ice cream for several months and went to the parlor that makes the best ice cream I’ve ever had. 

At first it felt a little strange and slightly sad, probably because the only other time I’ve been there was with a guy I used to date (no more feelings though because he was truly terrible but I’m glad I got a good ice cream spot out of it), but also because there were couples everywhere. 

But that feeling didn’t last long. The weather was great, I found a nice seat outside, walked around after and then listened to one of my favorite podcasts on the drive back.

Being single doesn’t suck as much when you date yourself. 

Plus I got to just spontaneous jump up and do whatever it was that I wanted to do and when I wanted. And there’s a lot of good and comfort in that freedom and flexibility.

Just thought I’d share because I’ve been seeing a lot of posts lately about people who’ve never been in relationships and people having a hard time being single.

I've gone on a ton of dates with different guys and I've broken things off for one reason or another with each one. There have been a few guys I really liked but they would only want to see me like once a week or two and barely text in-between dates. Trying not to come off as a crazy lady, I would always write this off as the guy being busy and try to play it cool and pull back on the texting/match their texting and pretend not to care that we only saw each other once every two weeks even if we lived 5 minutes from each other. If I brought seeing each other more often up they would just say they were too busy and didn't have time but wanted to continue dating and see where it would go. Eventually I'd jump ship because I'm too needy for that and could see it going nowhere!

People, do not fall into this crap!! Don't stay with someone who doesn't know what they want if you know what you want. If they don't text you and show interest and want to see you often, they aren't interested!! Every guy I broke it off with that only wanted to see me every other week wasn't upset in the slightest that I broke it off... Even the busiest people can make time for someone they're seriously interested in.

Anyways, I met someone who lives 2 hours away about a month ago. He has literally driven out to stay with me every weekend since our first date. (Reason being he just graduated from college and is still living with his parents so I can't stay over with him.) He sees me for 2-3 days a week despite the distance even though we aren't officially dating yet. He also talks about making it official and me meeting his family. I've also met his friends!! Even if we don't end up together forever, I know going forward I don't want to waste time with people who don't treat me like this. You shouldn't either!

329,f1tcsb,False,Giving Advice,143,10 Lessons Learnt from dating over an year.,dating,"Female's Perspective : I read this list everytime I start talking to a guy.

1. Everything is temporary, the attention, they complimenting you, those words or acts of validation, they making you feel special.
Atleast in the initial days/months.

2. Don't try to built a rapport right away, it kills your rationale. Slow and steady always wins.

3. In reference to online dating - Be the same as you appear to be on chats or maybe a level up. Appearing bold and fun over screen is much easier than in person.

4. Stop being nice. Show your considerate, loving, accomodating self after someone is hooked to you emotionally. 

5. Sleep with a guy on the first day, only if you are okay with him not calling/texting you the next day. Men say a lot before taking you to bed and forget everything the next day. 

6. I don't care about you attitude goes long way. Be selfish, think only about you. Don't be mean or rude, but altering your ways or believes for someone doesn't work. Men will only value you as much as you value yourself. 

7. Know the red flags men show you and act on them when you see. Moving away from wrong people as fast as you can is the key to dating. 

8. Be a good kisser/in bed - educate yourself, tips tricks take you long.

9. Men often drive the conversations in and around sex, if thats not what you looking for just ask good questions in return. You should drive the nature of conversations you want to have. If he stops responding, he was never in it for you.

10. Date with an intention, if the guy says casual he means it, you can't turn it around. And if he doesn't say it, he definately means casual.

332,a32ms4,False,Tinder/Online Dating,203,"My Tinder ""Date"" From Hell",dating,"Quick prequel - was dating this guy for awhile, really liked him. Long story short, he said he couldn't see himself marrying me but still wanted to date (i.e. fuck), so I broke up with him. Little bit of time went by, and I decided to get back into the dating pool via Tinder, even though I hate dating aps.

Matched with this guy ""Chad,"" hit it off via message. Good looking, educated, sense of humor. After a couple weeks exchanged numbers and continued chatting. Discussed meeting several times but our schedules clashed.

One day Chad texts me and asks to Venmo me some money to treat myself to a couple bottles of wine. Sounds awesome, I oblige. Also asks if I'd like to come over to his house after work. Says other people will be there, no pressure if I feel uncomfortable, etc. I actually didn't feel weirded out at all by this point (and I carry), so I agree.

I bring the wine (and my CC), and head over to Chad's after work. He is there, and two of his friends. They all seem perfectly nice and normal.

First weird thing: 4 total kitchen cabinets are completed ripped apart/smashed. This is a newer kitchen, nice cabinets. I inquire about the damage and Chad says he was ""mad,"" so he ""punched them."" Decide not to say anything additional about it. I grab an unopened beer for myself, then a coffee. Everything else is fine until I'm done with the coffee. One of the friends leaves, and a few minutes later it's like someone has flipped a switch on Chad. He completely loses his shit out of nowhere. Throws a metal barstool across the house, screaming like a lunatic child, chucks his phone into the kitchen wall. Remaining friend steps outside to smoke. Chad comes up to me out of nowhere and BITES my leg. I hit him in the head and he stops momentarily and then BITES me AGAIN. I hit him in the head hard as shit this time, and he stops. I ask for the bathroom, he walks over to show me and I don't know how else to explain this, but quite literally hurls himself up into the air in the hallway and lands flat on his back outside the bathroom door. Chad then gets mad that he has hurled himself onto the floor and punches a hole through the adjacent wall. I politely excuse myself to the restroom, in utter shock.

Come out of the bathroom, Chad approaches me and starts crying. Absolutely wailing. Going on about how is father is sick, this is a terrible time in his life, blah blah blah. I'm ready to get the fuck out but am concerned this guy may actually hurt himself and at the time felt some sort of responsibility to try to prevent that. I calm him down some, Chad's friend comes back in. Friend is suggesting we go fishing. Chad says he will, but would prefer to stay at the house to ""get to know me better."" No way in hell.

I agree to fishing so I can ""follow"" in my car and bail. Walk outside, Chad's friend gets in the driver's seat of Chad's car. I walk around and let the friend know I will be following in my car, he's cool with it. I get into my car (door is still open). Chad realizes I am not in his car, storms over and demands/begs I ride with them. Is completely adamant, but I stick to my guns and refuse. He says to ""go the fuck home then,"" and slams my car door shut. He then gets in the passenger seat of his car with his friend, and they drive off.

I sit for a few minutes calming down, processing, and pulling up GPS to go home. Start driving through the neighborhood. Make it around 3 corners and stop dead. Chad is standing in the middle of the road, facing me. He runs at my car FULL SPRINT, and slams both hands on the hood as hard as he can and runs them down like some sort of horror movie scene. He then runs over to my side, tries opening my door and rear door, screaming for me to open them. I decline. He punches my window, then the rear. I slam in reverse and floor it around the corner as he chases me on foot. Slam the car back in drive, and peel out of there as fast as I can. See the friend pulling back into the neighborhood and honk but don't slow down. I heard him yell ""sorry"" as I drive by.

&#x200B;

The next day Chad's friend found me on fb and messaged me apologizing, saying he has never seen that behavior before. Chad also texts me and tries to apologies, saying his friend told him he ""went psycho"" and he doesn't remember anything. I tell him he's lucky I didn't shoot him, and to never contact me again.

I have permanent bruises from the bites.

(25 y/o M)

A little less than a year ago, I was not in the dating scene. I had my goals in place, and an idea of how I wanted to peruse my passions. I didn’t want a relationship, right now, and wasn’t focused on women at all. One day I call in to set up a haircut appointment before a black-tie event that I needed to attend. My regular barber is out. I need a haircut fast. So I go to this salon chain that’s around the corner from my place. I sit down, and I’m greeted by the most gorgeous smile I’ve ever seen. This girl is just the best. She’s beautiful, she’s funny, she has a great laugh. She has this glow about her that is beyond comprehensible. I feel strong and confident, and I feel weak and timid at the same time. All I know is that I want to get to know this person - and I’ve never felt this way about anyone.

We talked well after she was done cutting my hair (the place was pretty empty). Our conversation went so well, it was like we knew each other for years. Everything just felt right. She told me later on that her coworkers even asked her if we knew each other, after I left.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I haven’t been able to get this girl out of my head. I wanted to see her again. So I wait a couple more days for my hair to grow out, and go back in on the same weekday and time to see her, hoping that it was the right day and time to. Luckily it was; she was there. She cuts my hair, we have another great interaction and can’t stop laughing at one another. I tell her that I like to go out singing Karaoke at this local place on Friday nights, and that she’s welcome to stop by if she’d like - that’s where I’d be. She doesn’t. Normally I’d just throw in the towel and say there’s no way a girl like that could be interested in a guy like me. But something in me decided to hold out hope; maybe she couldn’t that night - She never said she would, but she also never said she wouldn’t. She said “I’ll think about it”.

I wait a few more weeks for another ‘haircut’ and give it one more shot. I try to play it off cool, and tell her not to worry about the last time; I’m there most Friday nights, and she’s welcome to stop by any time.

Friday rolls around and there she is - I greet her, and her friend that she brought along. We have a great time, and I introduce them to my buddy (a gentleman, with manners and a great personality to boot) who also likes to sing. He acts as my wingman so-to-speak, and I finally get her number.

Fast forward and we’ve gone on several dates. We stay up in her car a lot just talking until sunrise. She always asks me why I smile every time I look at her, and I give her the same answer every time: “I’ll tell you someday”.

Whenever I start to make my leave she grabs onto my arm and does this little whine like she doesn’t want me to. It makes me feel special.

Fast forward some more, and we are official. Everything is going well. We do things together like travel to Baltimore, go to parties, restaurants, cook together, movie nights, things that we both like to do, etc. She tells me that she loves me one night when we were out. She continues by saying that she knows that’s a lot to handle, so soon, and that I don’t need to say it back. I don’t; but I wish I had, because that was the answer to the question she always asked me. Why do I always smile when I look at her? It was because I love her - I had since the day I walked into that salon.

We have our minor disagreements and arguments, but I never wanted to go to bed upset. I told her that we don’t always have to agree on everything. I was always willing to admit when I’m wrong, and I was always prepared to swallow my pride for her.

One of our biggest humps to get over was her Ex - a guy that was seemingly still in the picture. The problem was that she’d been dating him for 6 years; and had only been separated from him for several months before meeting me. The two of them owned a pet bunny together, and it wasn’t able to stay with her, so it had to stay with him. This meant that she would occasionally have to go up to his place to visit her. While I knew about the Ex BF and the bunny, It didn’t alarm me.

Until one afternoon, I invited her out with me and my brother, and she didn’t get back to me. Something seemed wrong - she hadn’t texted or called all day. The place we were going was only a half a mile from her house, so I drove past to see that her car wasn’t there. ‘Okay - maybe she’s with her family, out late, I thought’. I send her a message saying where my brother and I ended up, and that she’s welcome to join us.

She finally gets back to me and says “sorry I was sleeping - maybe another night, have fun!”

‘That’s odd, if she was at home sleeping, then where was her car?' The air over the next few days is cold and tense, to say the least. She finally confronts me about it, and I tell her what happened. I don’t yell, I don’t accuse, and I don’t ask for more information - I just tell her that something isn’t adding up, and It’s got me upset. She tells me the truth - she spent the day with her Ex BF, and wasn’t sure how to tell me, so she lied.

I give her a hug, and tell her that I love her for the first time. I tell her it’s okay, and that I don’t want to seem possessive or jealous. He was a big part of her life for 6 years - she’s only known me for several months at this point. Who am I to tell her who she can and can’t spend time with? I tell her that If she needs to talk to her Ex bf from time to time, or see her bunny up at his place, then that’s okay - just be honest about what’s going on. Don’t keep secrets, and don’t be shifty.

Things go pretty well for a while, after that.

Unfortunately the bunny died about a month later, and I was heartbroken to see her so upset.

A few months later, another problem rears its head; one that many people in relationships have to deal with, is sorting out family life. I live at home currently, with my father, brother, sister and 1 y/o niece.

My GF had been staying over a lot, and it was beginning to worry my dad. Her clothes were in half of my dresser. Her jackets, scarves, sweaters and shirts hanging in my closet, her shampoo and toiletries in my bathroom. On occasion, dad would come home to find her at my house, even though I was still at work. Dad and brother decide to have a conversation about it with me.

I don’t put up a fight - it doesn’t seem like there’s much to argue. She’s a guest, but it seems as if she’s moving in. She hardly spends any time at her own home, anymore. When she’s not at work, she’s at my house. When she’s not at my house, she’s at her friends house. I don’t want there to be bitterness between her and my family, but I like spending the nights with her. Plus she’s gotten used to it - and it would seem abrupt to pull the rug out from her like this. Once again, I’m at a loss.

I try to talk to her about it, but as expected, there is resentment. She’s not happy, and feels that she’s not welcome, anymore. She starts packing her stuff up. I convince her to stop, and we talk for a couple hours. Eventually we come to the conclusion that maybe we should start looking for a place, together.  There's too many heads under one roof.  She doesn't want to have to interact with my family every night - we need our own space .

Jump forward a couple weeks, and we’re just trying to work out our finances. I have a nice little nest egg that I’ve been saving up for some time, granted having gone to community college has kept me out of school debt.

We find a nice little place with cheap rent, and it’s probably about as good as it gets. It’s my first time looking for places though, and I just figure out of caution, let’s just look at some more places. Other places are only more expensive, and in the constant chaos of every day life events, looking for places just seems to fall into the background, and we slip back into our normal day-to-day of going to work, her staying over, and the two of us going out on the weekends.

I continue to keep searching for places, but it starts to become less and less of a priority when I bring it up. In the meantime, we still have fun with one another, we still talk, we still laugh and enjoy each others company, and we still love one another. She asks that I go to California with her to see her best friend. I tell her I’d like to, but we should be saving up for a place to live. I succumb to her wishes though, and chip-in for tickets. We are to head out in April.

Fast forward to V-Day of this year. I have a fun night planned for us. She can’t do it because she has to work Valentines day, last minute. So I come up with other plans for the weekend, instead. We decide to go to laser-tag. It seems cheesy, but it’s actually a lot of fun. As I’m getting ready to pick her up from work, I get a call from her asking if her two co-workers can join us. I’m not jumping for joy over it, as I thought I’d take her to dinner afterwards, but I tell her “sure, if you’d like them to join us”. I try to interact with her co-workers/friends; I don’t want them to think that I dislike them, but the more I focus on them, the less focused I am on her. She gets annoyed - and our date doesn’t go as nicely as I wanted it to.

About a week later, it’s as if nothing happened; water under the bridge. We’re happy with one another. One day I get in the car with her, so that we can go shopping for my Niece’s first b-day party. As we’re driving, she says she want’s to talk. Long and sort of the conversation - she wants to break up.

After the breakup, she becomes distant; like I don’t even matter to her. She calls me when she’s bored, and when I start to tell her how I miss her, she tells me that she doesn’t have the energy to talk about this - and proceeds to evade or redirect the conversation. She says that she doesn’t understand why she wanted to break up. That it wasn’t me, it’s her. That “she’s the kind of person that wants something so bad, and when she finally gets it, she doesn’t want it, anymore”.

One night I’m at a wedding. I’m trying to get back to my old self. I get on the dance floor and do some cheesy line-dancing. My sister snaps it, and puts it on my story for me. A couple hours later, My Ex puts a snap on her story for the first time in a very, very long time. It’s of her at a university having fun with I guy that I don’t recognize. I become very upset. My lips start to feel numb, my heart starts to pound, my skin feels cold to the touch, but my insides feel like they’re on fire. I excuse myself from the wedding reception. When I get home, I can’t sleep. My gut feels like it’s rotting from the inside-out, and I have the worst sleepless night that I’ve ever had.

I get it touch with her, and she tells me who the guy was (a friend of a friend) and that she’s sorry if I took it the wrong way. I continue to help her with things whenever she calls. We spend a few nights together on and off, and then the Stay-at-home order comes onto effect. I follow it, as I have my Niece to think about. She decides to crash with her friend while her family stays in isolation. I tell her that she’s more important to me than money, so if she still wants to bring me along to California, I’d be happy to come, but she can bring whoever she wants. She says, “thanks”.

Fast forward to today. She does’t talk to me, anymore. No one does. My friend who helped me secure her number at Karaoke night doesn’t answer when I check in to see how he’s doing. Normally I’ll shoot him a text message every once in a while that says something like “Hey, buddy hope all is well, just seeing how you’re doing”. He always gets back to me within a day. He hasn’t contacted me in months, though. He’s probably my only friend, honestly. My brother doesn’t want to talk, because he has nothing to offer, and my dad tells me that her being gone is the best possible thing that could’ve happened to me.

Every night since she left has been worse than the last. Every night I get ready for bed, and dread falling asleep, because she’s in my dreams, and I feel fine for a while, but then she's not next to me when I wake up. I keep wondering how I could go so quickly from being “the most important thing in her life” to being no more than a fleeting thought. I tried my best to be everything she wanted in a person; I thought I succeeded in that mission, and tired my best to never stop. But now I feel like I’m being purged from her life - like a disease. 

Up until I met her, I’ve felt like I was on my own.
I’d go out at night with myself, and feel like the invisible man.  I’d put on a fake smile, and laugh; but I knew the next day that the only person to greet me would be the man in the mirror.  She helped me to drop the fake smile, and put on a real one - she made me feel like I existed.  


I don’t consider myself to be a very clingy person; and frankly looking at this objectively, that’s exactly what it seems like. I feel like somethings wrong with me, and I don’t know how to reconcile with the fact that she’s still the most important person in the world to me. Love is not a climb, it’s a fall.

I fell in love with someone who doesn’t love me, anymore. I don’t know what to do. The rug was pulled out from under me, so quickly.

I’m angry with myself, I’m sad, and I’m very alone.

But more than anything I just love her, still. I miss her smile. I miss her laugh. I miss the tint of yellow in her blue-green eyes; It’s like a sunset over the ocean.

Every day I wake up and wish I hadn’t.

When I was a kid, we had this art project where we had to draw a monster with a “have you seen me?” Bio on the back; like a missing child on a milk carton. On the bio, you were supposed to explain your monsters hobbies, interests, where they like to spend their time, and who they like to spend their time with, etc. in hopes that they will be found. The monster was supposed to reflect yourself, obviously. Other kids were then supposed to guess who’s monster was who.

I drew a monster - I don’t remember much, but I remember he was black and blue, with silver eyes so he could see in the dark. He had wheels for legs, and walked on his hands. He lived in a dark place. He had no friends, and I remember his bio saying, “no one will ever find me”. 


My art teacher read these aloud to the class, and when she got to mine, glanced through it first, then frowned slightly before setting it aside, saying “I don’t want to read this one”. It was so crushing for some reason. It was like that was my opportunity to be found, and I was turned away.

I’m feeling a lot like that, again.

341,ez1pas,False,Venting,396,"I (25F) approached a random guy on the train, told him he was cute, gave him my number; here's the real life account of what comes after",dating,"So, a recap: about two weeks go I posted on this subreddit [a simple question aimed at all men - how would you react if a woman approached you in a public space and gave you her number?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/eqtj6e/men_in_this_sub_how_would_you_feel_if_a_woman/)

At the time, I had basically been faced with this situation: a really cute guy caught my eye on the commuter train, and I really wanted to approach him. Because I'm painfully shy and felt unable to make great conversation with him/couldn't stand the humiliation of being so publicly rejected, I took a post-it and wrote my number and a flattering little message on the paper. I held it in my hand forever trying to pluck up the courage to approach him, but he ended up hopping off the train before I had the chance to do it.

I instantly regretted not doing anything about it, and I promised myself that if this ever happened again, I would just. Do. It.

Fast-forward to today. I'm on the commuter train. Yet another guy shows up, and I have the same instinct - he's attractive, he's cute, I'm feeling him. I'm looking at him for a while with my sunglasses on, biting my lip and thinking ""Should I really do this?"". At the end, I just think ""Fuck it, what's the least that can happen?"". So I reach in my wallet for the post-it from two weeks ago (hey, might as well re-use it, right?), walked up to him. He was sitting down reading a book. I just said ""Hey, I have something I'd like to give you"", smiling; he just stares at me, surprised, at say ""Oh, thanks"", and takes the paper. I walked away immediately, so I'm not even sure that he read it or looked a it. By the time that I look behind me, he's opening his backpack and throwing the piece of paper inside. He looks at me with this dead serious look on his face, no smile, and proceeds to keep reading his book.

I eventually hopped off the train before he did, feeling absolutely defeated, disgusting, ugly, miserable. I mean, he was nice, he said thank you, he didn't do anything wrong per se. But I guess I was hoping for a more enthusiastic reaction, and his ""I could kill you"" look really demotivated me.

For a few hours I just kept thinking ""Well that's it, you're clearly unattractive and unloveable, might as well just forget about dating altogether"". But then again, I should be proud of what I did; I took a chance by putting myself out there and did something I never thought I could do. It gave me this strange adrenaline, my heart was beating so fast! His response was quite negative, a lot more than what I thought possible, but I'm trying to be positive and I'm still proud of myself. And hey, maybe some day some guy on some train somewhere, wherever I end, will actually make good use of my number, right?

So, TL;DR: followed people's advice from a few weeks ago to approach people on the train. Ended up getting deadly rejected, but that's okay, because I felt a strange rush I hadn't felt in years. Doesn't matter if the world thinks I'm ugly or fat or whatever, it still made me feel alive!

UPDATE: wow, I did not expect these many responses; I just woke up this morning with so many kind words and interesting thoughts/opinions from you guys.

I saw her once more after that and was very nice to her. It was awkward though. There was nothing wrong with her. She was cute and nice.

I've never been in a serious relationship, now I've ""talked"" to guys on dating apps, but it hasnt gone anywhere because guys have been too forward with me too quickly, or the conversation hasnt gone anywhere.

349,e0ei30,False,Tinder/Online Dating,177,I’ve been off dating apps for 3 months and...,dating,"I’m 23 year old female, and I had been on tinder and bumble for a little over 2 years. Now, I wasn’t very active, but there were days and nights that I was bored and wanted someone to talk to. No harm in that.
But, once I graduated I started to realize I wanted more than just casual conversation; I wanted to find love. 
So I deleted Tinder. I mean, it’s just creepy guys anyway right?
But I kept bumble because it seemed like the way to go. I would talk to multiple guys daily, sometimes we would even exchange phone numbers and snapchats. Some of the guys were douchebags, some were genuinely nice. 
Out of all the guys I talked to, I only met 2 in person. Now, I did get asked on dates, but then most guys would cancel the day (one time the hour) before. 

Online dating for me was a never ending “talking” phase. People wanted to talk daily, but never wanted anything to go past a screen. I had fights, anxiety, even tears over some of these guys.

I was having relationship problems without being in a relationship .

You may say that speaks more to me and my personality rather then there’s, but I think it shows what online dating really is for different people. For me, I was looking for a relationship. I was looking for “the one.” While many guys were looking for “the one...for right now.” They we’re looking for a distraction, not a commitment.
I would complain to my friends saying “no one wants me,” and i had data to back it up. Guys would ghost me, use me, drop conversations, and it felt like I was undesirable.
 
Finally I decided enough was enough. I deleted Bumble. I was free ... so I thought. 

The first week I felt like I was on withdrawal. Who was I to talk to? What if that one cute guy messaged me back and now can’t get ahold of me? What if, what if what if. Those two words rang in my head daily. 

By week two I had started to notice that there were men around me that were nice and caring, but I still was tempted to re download the app because checking it had become so routine. 

By the end of month one I felt completely free. I felt a new found sense of confidence. If a guy really wants to be with me, he’ll ask me out. I’m worthy of being chased and I’m tired of chasing. 

By month two I had started to see my life rebuild. I was putting all the energy I had reserved for boys and put it into my relationship with friends, family, God, and myself. I started creating my own affirmation instead of looking for someone else to give it to me. I even was asked on a few dates with guys I met IN PERSON. 
I guess I realized that I’m special and I should be treated as such.

Now that I just finished my third month I feel like I should get a sober chip or something. Online dating/constant affirmation is addicting. It’s so easy to make virtual boys have power in your life. 

I still feel lonely sometimes, but the difference is I know I’m not alone. I know that these temporary feelings are just that: temporary. 

A right swipe won’t fix them, and that’s okay. 

I just wrote this to share my story and to encourage a young woman or man today. If you feel like a dating app or website is bringing you stress, lowering your self esteem, or gives you anxiety, I challenge you to 2 weeks free of them.

Met this girl one night, we hit it off, exchanged numbers, exchanged texts etc etc (this was the era when smartphones were just becoming a thing). We ended up arranging to meet for a meal, ""great!"" thinks I, but no.  


Turned up at the restaurant  we had arranged to meet up at about half an hour early, there was no need to book tables etc as it was one of those places where you just turn up and wait for a table. 45 minutes later im still stood there, so I texted her to see if there as a problem, she replied with an apology as she was running late, ok, no problem. She turned up about half an hour later and we finally sat down, ordered and got drinks in etc.  
All sounds ok so far doesnt it?, well, the alarm bells started to ring when I tried a few times to start a conversation, but got only monosyllable answers in response, or just plain old grunts,due to her sat playing with her phone.   
Starter had been consumed and main course had just been plonked down, and by that point i was beginning to think she had forgotten how to string a sentance together, well, until she shouted a waiter over and ordered another bottleof wine for herself, this time picking a bottle which was a fair bit more expensive than the type she had been drinking at the start, and all the time she NEVER put her phone down, and to add insult to injury, as the waiter brought the wine over, he said something like ""good choice"" to which she replied ""hes paying so I hope it is"".  


At this point i was somewhat pissed off and getting tired just from watching her thumbs wiggle about over the keypad, so I finished my main course and excused myself to go to the gents, dunno if she actually heard me, as i didnt even hear a grunt in response.

351,beopvr,False,Giving Advice,157,I've tried Reddit's dating advice for a year. This is what I've learned:,dating,"About a year ago, I just got out of a long-ass relationship and wanted to date but had no idea how. So I read a lot of Reddit posts about dating advice. 

&#x200B;

The most common advice was, ""Go to Meetups or any social gatherings and make female friends"". This strategy was based on two things: 

1. Online dating sucks.

2. You can develop your friendship into a romantic relationship or be introduced to someone who is interested in you through female friends.

&#x200B;

So I tried the advice above for a year and found out, **this is not a good strategy.** I went to a lot of Meetups and I can tell you this, Meetup is overrated. However, I was able to make lots of female friends (I had to try so freaking hard), and this is where the strategy starts to show flaws. The chance of developing a friendship into a romantic relationship exists (low), but the problem is that it takes a long time to figure out if it's gonna work or not. It can take years. 

&#x200B;

You can't expect your friends to find your lover for you. Friends are just friends, you can't have another intention. You're on your own!

&#x200B;

So, what you should do? Here's my advice (and this advice is also coming from my female friends). Don't try to be a friend. **Just ask out for a date within 1-3 meetings**. And move on. I know it's really awkward and embarrassing. But this way you don't waste your time. You can increase your chance of being accepted if you build a good friendship with that person, but again, it takes too much time. And the chance is just a **slight difference.** You can ask dozens of people out for that period of time. Do the math. 

&#x200B;

I agree that online dating sucks. But look around you, most couples nowadays met through online dating sites. I know that the chance is very low, but it is what it is. **Unfortunately, there's no better way.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/beopvr/ive_tried_reddits_dating_advice_for_a_year_this/,473,"1.

The bottom line is simple. Some of you need to learn how to love yourselves first. A lot of you are insecure, unable to know what you want, but you're  quick to find someone  else because you're  lonely.

9/10 this leads to finding the wrong people to where you'll be back there again on here now asking  if the person in your life is good for you when they're  obviously  doing shitty stuff.
 
With all that said, yes there are exceprions to the rule here. People who take advice, people who wish to make a change and want better. 

Realize one thing  ladies and gents  you need to make a better you for someone else and they need to make themselves a better them for you. 

No matter how many dating apps you use and or delete or person you meet in person if your life is fubar you'll  never live to your optimum level.

353,c7j60k,False,Giving Advice,31,I think it's important to figure out why you want to date before you start dating,dating,"For the last couple months, I've made a half-assed attempt at dating. I think deep in my heart, I didn't actually want to date and knew that now is not a good time to date. I am already spending 80+ hrs working and studying a week, and there's just no way I can squeeze out time for dating. Recently in a moment of introspection, I realized that all the working plus studying in the last couple years have put me in a pretty bad place, mentally. I'm not depressed or anything, but I am absolutely burnt out. If I were a steak, I'd be well-done with a black crust. I realized that I wanted someone to date because I wanted someone for me to complain to and comfort me, but I also realized that I didn't have the time or the energy to reciprocate if my partner wanted the same from me. Also, since a lot of my friends are in a relationship, I felt pressured to do the same, but then I realized that while they work to live, I live to work. They're all pretty complacent with their careers (which is totally fine) while I'm more interested in gaining as much experience and making as much money as I can. Trying to date with my schedule would have been a disaster, and dating for the sole reason of not being left behind is pretty dumb. Thus, from the very beginning, my motivations to date were tainted.

What I really needed all this time was to find a way to relieve all the stress and do things that I enjoy. Thus, I started practicing yoga recently, and it's been rather incredible. It helped me with my hip pain that's been bothering me for the last year, and I felt very at peace at the end of each class. I'm also planning a trip to the UK, and my plan is to travel to two new countries per year. I've always wanted to travel the world, but I've been so busy in the last couple years that I haven't even left my home state (well except one trip to NYC for work). Essentially, I want to get to a place in life where I can get up every morning well-rested and content rather than scrambled and irritated. Only then do I think I'll be ready to date.

I think a lot of people view dating as a panacea to their problems in life, but this is almost certainly the wrong approach. Until you're in a good place in your own life, you're not really in a good place to date. Dating is give and take, and you cannot expect someone to care for your physical/emotional needs while you're in no place to provide either. If you're feeling stressed, lonely, angry, or anything negative, then that needs to be fixed first. Otherwise, people will see right through you and your problems, and most people don't want to handle that kind of baggage from the get-go. For example, in the past year, whenever I met someone new, I always found myself talking too much about my job to them because I was stressed and kinda turned a conversation into a personal therapy session. I was shocked when I realized that, and if I could see that, then others must have seen right through me. It's no wonder that I didn't make many lasting relationships in the last couple years. A lot of our misery comes from not being able to pinpoint our problems, and life isn't a romantic novel where a mysterious stranger transforms our lives from a shithole to Eden. If you are in a shithole right now, you have to figure out why you're there in the first place and then climb out on your own.

I'm content with being single, however, I'm actively looking for a relationship, and I'm sure all of us single people know, it feels hopeless.

I currently live with my high school buddy and his girlfriend.  We all have a good relationship with each other, and its not awkward at all to live with them because they're both good friends of mine.  But there are times where they'll cuddle together and watch a movie, and I'll be in the other room, notice them, and start feeling like ""wow, it would be great to have that right now."".  Whenever the other comes home, they're always there to greet them, ask how their day was, and give each other a kiss.  Stuff like that is what I want out of a relationship.  I'm in a band with some other friends of mine, and they are all in relationships, one of them is married, another just became engaged, so on, so forth.  I don't have a lot of friends, but I'm very close to the people I keep regular contact with.  And everyone is in a freaking relationship.  Now, there's a lot of good and bad that comes with both being single, and being in a relationship, and I'm embracing all of that while I can.  But a big part of me wants to have someone to love.  I work at a retail store, I sell shoes, and I deal with couples very often.  Seeing some good and some bad relationships gives me perspective, but I've also never been in love, so I'm always asking myself, is it better to have loved, then lost? or to have never loved at all?

I just ended a relationship with a girl I was only seeing for a month. It was due to incompatibility with how we dealt with problems. I like to deal with problems head on and discuss them to try and make sure there are no misunderstandings whereas she had an ignore it till it goes away approach.

Her feelings were much stronger than mine. After a lengthy text exchange we finally said our final goodbyes and it sucks knowing what I feel is self-inflicted and it really hurts me that she is hurting as well.

I ended it because there was a 6 month expiry date to the relationship anyway given that I'd be leaving the country soon and I felt like some of the problems we were having would keep recurring given our different approaches to problem solving.

363,cb9h5n,False,Giving Advice,279,Some stuff men might not admit (Serious),dating,"A little long, but worth the read.

I think a lot of men forget that other men are *typically* very similar to them, I would even go so far as to argue that when it comes to day to day things, and dating, most straight men are pretty similar, or at least have similar experiences, even some of my gay friends can relate to the issues I and other straight friends have. If some men want to disagree or provide their own takes in the comments, I welcome them as long as they're civil. I'd also like to say that men who will use this to jusitfy abusive behavior can GTFO. I'm going to talk about unintentionally toxic behavior, and emotional issues.

Now, obviously we know that even today it's considered a faux pax for men to express their emotions. This is not a woman bashing post, but lets be real here, when girls say their want a guy who's open with their feelings, they usually have a specific exchange or circumstance in mind, both myself, my brother, and friends have had women, especially, but not exclusively, those who aren't dating them, or who are just in the talking phase, turn their backs when things got rough for the guy. I have *straight up* told women that I'm feeling kind of lonely or down, and been outright accused of trying to get in their pants, or been told I'm being dramatic, and yes, even to ""man up.""

Today's dating world has become so toxic for men, online guys match with a fraction of the women they ""like"", even the hottest dude on tinder will get less matches than an average looking girl. My younger brother is a genuinely good looking dude, I'd even admit that sometimes I wish I looked a tad more like him, though I am still confident in myself, that' s not the point. He made a tinder after his breakup, and his girlfriend did the same, in the first WEEK my brother had a few dozen matches, his ex, who was cute, but not a dime by any means had over 200. I had a similar experience after my breakup. My point is: women have a smorgasbord of choices, men have slim pickings, and don't even get me started about dating in public.

Personally I have luck sometimes, and that's they keyword, sometimes. To the guys out there, most of the men you see with a woman on his arm, or successfully flirting at a bar are likely having their ""sometimes"" that night, and I imagine when you've had yours, more than a few dudes looked longingly. The constant temptation of online dating, and being able to see ""other options"" has made it insurmountably difficult for guys, especially those who might have a ""normal job"" or ""average looks"" to hold the attention of a woman. And to an extent, can we blame girls for picking top shelf? I would if I could, but the reality is that I just want someone I feel a natural connection with, and I know for a fact men tend to have a lower bar, or more flexible standards. They're more willing to overlook flaws, while women have to truly love a man for this to be the case, I've definitely torpedoed my chance with one word or misunderstood sentence before, while a woman saying something questionable during a date might not even phase me.

Men, simply put, want physical interaction as much as anyone else. Not sex, but just a touch, a kiss, a hand to hold, and lot of men in our generation have gone months, maybe even a year or two since they've been able to feel even so much as a flutter in their heart about someone. Today it seems to almost be a rat race to see who gets the girl, and women wonder why guy's act like cocks when they're rejected, or if the woman loses interest. Yeah, some guys are ego-maniacal, but most are just lonely, hurt, and angry. It's true that men's ego's are easy to inflate, but that's not a bad thing! I cannot tell you how many times some flirty eyes have boosted my confidence, reassured me that I'm a good looking dude, and that I can approach people and start a conversation. It still happens, but seems punctuated by rejection and failure, and it puts dudes in a dark place. I've heard girls talk about how they wish men still approached them, but with all the toxicity online, and in the news with guys being (justifiably) accused of sexual misconduct, it makes considerate men second guess their approaches, or even the thought of chit chatting with the girl in the elevator, or sitting alone at the bar. And often when a woman does appreciate a man's approach, she puts him in a box, because she feels safe calling him her friend. Once again, not to suggest women are obligated, but there's almost a stigma nowadays against dating your friend, when IMO, and most guy's opinion, your SO should be your best friend.

I guess I'll wrap this up by simply saying to my fellow single men, we're all in this boat together. It's not unusual to feel sad or alone, and most dudes are trying just as hard as you to ""get the girl"" whether it be online, at the bar, or anywhere for that matter. And to the women, please understand that most men are *not* pigs, and that showing venerability really isn't a sign of weakness, but a sign of a man who truly just wants the most basic degree of human interaction. With so much going on in the world, and with all of us trying to build successful lives, I think we've begun to neglect the human connections. To most men sex is an acceptable substitute, but not the replacement for healthy dating life, and ""all we want"" is to feel the warmth of your body next to ours. We're soft, emotional creatures just like you, but it's society's views on masculinity that create a hard shell that might seem scary at first. I implore both men and women to give each other chances, make plans a week out, put aside things for a dinner date, and give people a fighting chances before going back to swiping. So much ugliness in the world could be solved if we just let love take root before ripping it out, or dashing it away.

Once again, I welcome comments/opinions, or your own experiences, just please keep it respectful, even if you disagree or object.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should just reiterate again, this is not some sort of indictment on women, or an anti women post, I have the upmost respect for women, but I also do treat them as equals, love/friendship is a two way street. I'm giving a man's perspective here, and perhaps providing some insight that *some* women might not have. The big keyword here is *some* I can't paint everyone with a broad brush, therefore I'm speaking in generalities.

EDIT 2: Any gay bashing, or saying that I am gay, should be gay, etc will be reported. The whole point of this post is to show that straight men aren't all emotionally dry beings, not a huge fan of the term ""toxic masculinity"" but if anything calling another man gay for opening up about his vulnerabilities is toxic and IMO indicates your own insecurities.

EDIT 3: WOMEN, please, by all means, give us dudes some advice! That's what this page is for.

You would want a car that will last you a long time, if not the rest of your life. Now while you might want to save more for a better car, you will get it if you're patient. And sometimes love finds you when you least expect it. So maybe stop looking for awhile and make sure you have yourself in check! Women also love men with goals in life and men who have their life planned out. When my boyfriend told me what he wanted to be and how he was already getting there, I immediately felt more attracted since it showed a sign of his maturity. And emotionally, girls like maturity in guys and definitely someone who can keep it in their pants and not talk about it!

I’m the type of person who tends to fall fast and real hard for someone I like very early on. Sometimes I get way too ahead of my feelings and find it hard to keep my emotions in check.

UPDATE: Wow, thanks so much everyone for your encouragement and feedback. You have me convinced that I need to initiate our next date. I plan to text him this morning and let him know I had fun. Any advice on initiating the second date would be appreciated. My schedule is going to get busy Thursday thru the first weekend in December, so I'm wondering if it would be too soon to suggest dinner one night this week. Thanks again :) This is my (27F) first time dating after a LTR and I'm trying my best. Really appreciate you all.

I just had a fantastic first date! Grabbed coffee with a guy I've been chatting with on and off for a weeks now. It was amazing. Now I know what a healthy date feels like. I felt respected and heard. I was interested in what he had to say, and vice versa. 

We work in similar fields, majored in the same thing in college, and share similar interests. We talked about travel, family, TV, work, and books. The conversation was great. We talked for about an hour and a half. I feel like we could have gone on talking all day. We both agreed that we had fun talking to each other.

I have no idea if there will be a second date. My plan from here is to sit back, reflect on how the date made me feel, and live my life. I think I'm going to let him take the lead on whether he wants to see me again.

The last guy I dated had a way of making me feel confused, desperate, and clingy. This guy made me feel like an interesting, valuable person.

371,bk8hn2,False,Giving Advice,51,I (26F) just had the perfect date with my teenage crush of 12 years. I am stunned.,dating,"Hi everyone,

I am still in awe of what just happened. I just had an almost out-of-body experience with my teenage crush - as silly as it sounds. My story sounds like it came out of the cheesiest and most insane rom-com but I wanted to share with you all because I wanted to say: DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

I had a crush on this guy since I was 14. He was the classic looking-cute kind of guy that you check out at the same ""spot"" every weekend or so, where all the kids hangs out. I was obsessed with him, I would drool everytime I'd see him with his friends - I thought he was the coolest guy I'd ever seen in my life. We never got to talk, I was super awkward with not a lot of experience and I was freaking the fuck out whenever he was near me. You know, very immature kid-dy stuff. All my friends would know about him but nothing ever came out of it. I stopped seeing him after high school.

Fast forward 7 years, I bump into him in a party. I was with a couple of friends from school and when I told them he was at the party, they got even more excited than I did. We were a bit drunk and my friend kind of pushed me his way (embarrassing, I know) and we started talking. He seemed interested right away and he was asking me very genuine questions and I was so impressed. Also was dying inside. He asked for my number and then left fairly early because his friends were leaving. Next day he did message me and asked to hang out but at the time I had just started being with someone else so I felt bad and cut the conversation short. He was still THAT guy and I was of course disappointed over it but at the same time I found it very rewarding (for the sake of my 15-year-old self) so I got over it.

Now fast forward 3 years, I am newly single and got together with the high school friend I mentioned above. We got drunk while catching up over high school and reminiscing about everything. She prompted me to message this guy. I did and he responded right away asking where the hell did I remember him. Long story short we start chatting again and we now live in different countries so he's asking me when I'm going back. I told him and he messaged me the day I got there.

We arranged to go for a date and I have never felt so nervous in my life. I wanted to throw up beforehand it was so bad. I would finally go out on a date with the guy I'd spend so much time on in my high school years. He was a profound part of my life at the time (as silly as it sounds) and now we're here. I don't know how I pulled through but I showed up. He was great. Conversation was effortless. We hit it off right away. I caught myself being so confident and charming and just everything I never thought I was - he was clearly infatuated with me from the get go too. A lot of compliments, a lot of touching, we scrapped the small talk and started talking about ""deep"" topics right away and towards the end he was like ""The way you talk about things freaks me out because it sounds exactly like me"". I had no idea that on top of him finding me interesting and beautiful, we also both felt like we had so many things in common. It was a surreal moment. I never knew much about this guy - he was like a celebrity to me, someone you don't know much about but you freak out over them regardless. Him telling me so many wonderful things and sounding like a great guy is something that I would love for every single one of you to experience. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. What comes around...

We kissed throughout the night and it was amazing.  Everything was what the 15-year-old me was dreaming of and more. We are now seeing each other soon because he's going to come over to my country soon. I know this isn't going anywhere, we are thousands of miles apart and it's virtually impossible to sustain anything like this but the dream came true and it was incredible to see that sometimes ridiculous Hollywood scripts do come true. 

My advice to all of you if you are on a similar boat with someone is go for it. There is nothing to lose and the universe might already be plotting in your favour (also your friends!). Dating can be such a wonderful experience if you find the right person at the right time and who knows where the night will take you.

372,fhh25n,False,I Need Advice,85,Dating virgin,dating,"So...4 recent dates. 2 were duds, 1 was effortlessly fun and sparky, and the latest 1 was nice. 

Effotlessly fun one- chatted on Bumble for a few weeks. A+ banter, personality and cute messages. Met IRL and we seemed to click right away, didn't feel awkward AT ALL, had a good time. There was chemistry and I knew I liked him because I wanted to TOUCH him. Nice eyes, hands (good sign!), thighs. After the date, he asked in one of his last messages if I wanted to see him naked. I replied saying I like things a little slower, but had a great time. Messaged died out. Really liked him, and imagined us having sex, but needed a bit more than 2 hours. Not a bad guy, but looking back, can see he doesn't have the emotional availably for a relationship right now.

Latest guy, exchanged 20 messages in 2 days and met up for a drink. He was nice, but so chatty that I didn't have a chance to ask him many questions and it didn't allow for banter, it was conversation heavy. He said I was very quiet, but nice. He asked if I'd want to meet up again and my intentions. I said a boyfriend, and he was sussing out if I'd be interested in something causal.

Yes, I want love and a relationship, but I'm also ready for sex - emotionally, physically, mentally. But I need a bit of emotional connection so I feel safe and can enjoy my first time. Like, maybe I don't even need the first guy to be my boyfriend, but I'm not ready for sex after 1 date. If I like them, should I be saying I'd be okay with something casual if I got to know them a bit? That probably doesn't sound very casual.

Catch 22 - you want to be fun and flirty on dates so you can see if you have chemistry and click - but this leads people to ASSUME experience because most 23 y/o have had sex. But if I hold back, not super flirty, they seem to think I'm too quiet/disinterested. But hey, he assumed experience anyway. I'm just trying to be careful, have fun.

He wanted to know if he was ""getting played.""

For whatever reason she wasn't very communicative and the date day had passed. 

His responses were short and annoyed. Asking ""When we seeing eachother?"" her responses were simply side stepping his questions and his responses got more and more frustrated. 

My advice to him and to every guy experiencing something like this is:

1) You need to completely reframe why you're talking to women in the first place

2) If a girl is acting flakey, ESPECIALLY before a first date, just move on and whatever you do, **never** show frustration.


Re number 1, I've been in a couple LTR's (6 and 3 years) and I think generally speaking my goal is to make a connection with a girl who is interesting. Obviously I need to be attracted to her too and obviously sex is on my mind if that's the case, but my main goal is not to get laid as soon as possible and I think the lack of desparation is obvious to my dates. 

I've been trying to understand what I've been doing right these last few months as my dates have been pretty successfull. 

It's 100% what you value. I place a lot of value in building close relationships with people in general, especially with women.  

If a woman isn't interested in that, with me, I move on because why would I waste my time forcing something that can't be forced? 

So ask yourself, what do I actually value in dating, what am I truly looking for? And if that person doesn't seem to align, move on.

I can imagine it being frustrating. 

But men seem to portray it as if height 'discrimination' is a thing only women do.

I'm 180cm, so I'm a tall woman. I don't discriminate in height, most of my boyfriends were shorter than me. 

But I lost count of how many men in OLD have told me that I'm just good to fuck because of my height, but not relationship material. That I'm a really interesting person and attractive but they can't have a girlfriend who is taller than them or would be taller than them with high heels on. Then they wouldn't look 'man' enough.. 

So, if it could be of any consolation, the discrimination goes both ways. :) 

And to be honest, I don't even care that much. I want a confident boyfriend, someone who isn't superficial or has a fragile ego. So my height is already a good filter to help filter part of the fragile egos out. And I assume it's also the other way around.

The thing is, I don't even enjoy first dates, not really.

You don't also don't have to specify that it's a DATE... just invite her out to some event you're already planning on going to or just to simply hang. It's weird I know but sometimes girls prefer it to be casual versus a date. They like being courted but subtly and smoothly. especially when it's a work relationship.......

also, did you try to do any small talk? you said you knew her for 2 years but how much interaction did you have??

My guess is you talked to her initially when you first got there..

 didn't talk for a long time but thought about her a lot... built up the courage, made a weird intro and just asked her..........which doesn't work.....

the reason you use small talk, is to gauge her interest level..... actually you can use this with anybody.... and through small talk you can seamlessly transition into asking her out or exiting the convo....

lastly, if what she said hurt you because it's true, then fix it... that means take care of yourself in the mental, physical, spiritual, finances etc.... or find your purpose in life... do any of these things and then the shit people say will just be white noise ",2019-06-29 10:57:22

Remember to stop yourself from over analyzing small details that you know mean nothing in comparison to the big picture.

* If you stop using the Internet and go out and join some activity or group, you'll automatically meet someone right away because that's where all of these hidden gems of perfect matches have been hiding all along.
* You also haven't already thought of that and tried that a dozen times, and realized doing so was filled with people you weren't into, were not your age, and attractive people who have their shit together never join these kinds of things.
* Guys who aren't succeeding at dating *must* be coming off as desperate. That's the only explanation!
* All women have an endless line of suitors, all of whom are male models, and they never feel lonely or sad with dating and hookups.
* If you say you're lonely and feeling down, someone who knows nothing about your life assumes you're clinically depressed and tells you that you need to go to therapy because heaven forbid anyone vent something that's not positive.
* Online dating works the same exact way for everyone, regardless of gender, location, race, and age, so if it's not working for you, ""there must be something wrong with you"" or that your profile must totally suck even though you have a Master's in Writing and are a professional photographer who knows their way around words and pictures.
* Just move and get a new job some place where there's more people. That will fix everything, even though you've already done that twice or more, and only found yourself among more people your age who are taken and married, so now you feel even more single than you did when you lived in a smaller area.

That’s what all this bettering yourself pep talk is aimed at: to make men more confident and better providers so they can be better boyfriend material. As long as your personality isn’t absolutely awful, if you’re decently winning at basic life stuff you probably have some value as boyfriend material. Being hookup material is different. That’s more of a you have it or you don’t kind of thing. And a lot of men don’t have it. Men have much less control over that I think. It’s a roll of the dice and a much more difficult skillset to learn if you don’t already have it. So basically I think it’s frequently easier to be boyfriend material than hookup material.

So a lot of guys are boyfriend material but not hookup material. Which sets things up for a lot of confusion and frustration for these guys over why they are apparently not wanted when all the cool kids are hooking up all the time. Then eventually most of them get settled for. I think a lot of these are the original “nice guys finish last” type of nice guys. But it’s not that they’re nice. At least not entirely, maybe being overly nice factors into the issue. They just aren’t hookup material for some reason.

I’m definitely not a master chef, but women I have over seem to like it when I cook for them! It’s also loads of fun to have them involved in making the dish. I make sure to ask for feedback when I’m adding spices or ingredients, and I like to have them help out with chopping things up or other such things — that way the dish isn’t just mine, but theirs too. 


**Wine.** 

A nice wine selection never hurts. It’s a good way to take the edge off of any initial awkwardness if you’re just meeting them, y’know?


**Scents.**

If you’re bringing someone to your place for the first time, it’s good to have a pleasant smell to greet them when they walk in. I like to have little jars of spices and potpourri, as well as scented candles.


**Having a space of conversation starters.**

I like to make my room easy to comment on. This can range from having books on the nightstand, instruments laying out in conspicuous places, posters, that sort of thing. (Of course, I keep it clean and smelling nice too, but that’s a given.)


**A weighted blanket.**

This might sound corny, but it’s frighteningly effective — I have a weighted blanket, and I like to offer people a chance to try it out, usually after a glass of wine or two. I don’t think I need to explain this one.

Another time we were listening to a lecture and I was falling asleep (I was sitting in front oh him) when I rested my head on the back of my chair he picked my head up with his hand and put his arm under it. Thing is, we haven’t talked at all about this whole me liking him thing, and we don’t text much of at all (he leaves me on seen actually) and last Thursday I asked him if we could chat and he avoided it - but to be fair to him he could’ve been busy like he said idk.

Honestly I’m so confused. I have no idea what to think. I messaged him today to tell him we should chat on Monday at lunch at that lunch was on me. So hopefully all goes well. I’m pretty certain that if he was sure about me he’d have already said something, so either he’s unsure or doesn’t want to let me down.

I had some progress earlier this year when I finally lost my virginity, but the guy I gave it to, told me I was special, but his life was too chaotic at the moment and he wasn’t ready for a relationship. So naturally, I took that as “I want to be in a relationship, I just don’t want to be in one with you.”

At this point it’s getting embarrassing because my parents are now stating that I should let them pick someone for me. And I even decided to delete all of my social medias because I couldn’t stand seeing all those around me getting into relationships, getting serious with someone, or getting engaged/married. Meanwhile, I’m still here, watching from the sidelines and panicking because surely everyone is laughing at me for being single for the past thirteen years.

Do you ever hate hearing “you’ll find someone.” ? Because frankly, I honestly don’t think that there is someone for everyone out there. Dating and constant rejection has made me numb. And the fact that I’m basically 30, and still haven’t found someone to love me, or even try to get to know me, brings me to tears.

Getting random girls to go on dates with me wansn't easy, but I did go to alot of dates (I've gone out with like 20 girls) and I've just been so sad, because it never seems to go anywhere from the first date, either it's the classic ""i'm busy"" or you just get ghosted. It just feels like a routine at this point. At this point, you, the person who is reading this, will say something like: ""Dating shouldn't be a chore, and you're suppost to have fun"". How should I suppost to be having fun, when whenever talking to the other girl, they feel like, they have a gun pointing to their head, and don't share much about them?  I've been single for a long time, and I used that time to really find out what kind of person I truly am, what I enjoy, and what I need. I'm not miserable, I'm studying right now, have good friends, I enjoy making people, I love to cook and for hobbies I enjoy fixing cars, I don't get anxious when talking to girls, so I think i'm ready to be dating. Now, again, you the reader, will say something like: ""Take a break"". I did, like 6 times. I've reinstalled like tinder 6 fucking times, and still, theres nothing I found. I need real advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/eh6p1h/why_is_dating_so_shit_nowadays/,418,cuz people are shit LOL!!! ,2019-12-29 14:47:43

414,ccbhcd,False,None,95,Online Dating - Tips from an Average Joe (with examples)!,dating,"First of all, hey. How are you doing? This will be the first and last time I open like this. Unless you’re a model or Chris Hemsworth levels of attractive, you should never open up with “Hey” or “How are you?”. If you stop reading now and take anything away from this post, let it be this.


I’m a 24 year old male student, average plus looking, I’d give me a 6 or 7, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I don’t have a fancy job or even a car, I’m a pretty average man who has had a great amount of success on dating apps. After lurking around and trying to improve my game and myself, I’d like to share what personally helped me improve my chances to translate a match into a date.

*Disclaimer* I'm a straight man, so I'll be sharing my experience talking and meeting up with Straight/Bi women. Most of the advice here can be applied for every person you meet online. Plus English isn't my first language and I'm translating all of these convos from my language, happy reading!


**Opener**

Openers are important. They are. You should always think of a good one, with the balance of being witty, funny and charming, while not sounding too “try-hardy”. Sounds tricky, and at first it is, but a good opener improves your chance significantly to get a date with the girl you’re talking to. Still don’t think openers are important? I’ll share a story.

I live with two female roommates. We’re pretty open with each other and share stories about our dating lives quite often. One night we’re hanging out and we talk about dating apps, one thing led to another and they ended up both creating accounts that same night. They both got over 100 likes. In less than an hour. Woke up in the morning and one had 300 and the other 400. After 24 hours they both got over 999+ likes. 

Point of the story is, if it wasn’t obvious already, women tend to have a lot more option than men on dating apps. For every girl you’re talking to, there’s 19 other guys texting her and sending her messages. 50% of those men will probably open with “Hey”, or “How are you doing?” or some variation of that. Men who want to improve their chances need to stand out of the crowd. If our appearance isn’t going to help us stand out, our opener will. So how do we do that? 

Think to yourself “What do you like about this girl?” “Why did I swipe on her in the first place?” “What’s attractive to me about her?” Thought of something? Good. Take that idea/compliment/statement and add a little twist to it. Complimenting is always better than “hey”, but something even better is to take that statement and be playful or tease a little bit. I read a tip on the ""dating advice"" sub by [LeatherDaddyLongLegs](https://www.reddit.com/user/LeatherDaddyLonglegs) which I agree with- If you're going to compliment someone, compliment them on something they have control over. I’ll give a few IRL examples of openers that got me numbers. Bear with me since I’m translating from my native tongue to English:

Girl with a bio stating she’s studying engineering, has a dog in one of her pictures:

    Me: “I’ll be honest with you, I just want to meet your puppy, but I haven’t found her on the app yet.”
    Her: “Haha it’s a he. Are you still sure that you want to meet him?”
    Me: “Sure, but make sure he doesn’t have any expectations. Maybe I’ll meet a cute engineer along the way.”

Girl with a bio stating her hobbies include singing in the shower, generic pictures:

    Me: “I hope you like singing outside the shower as well, you can complete my duet while we cook dinner”
    Her: “Hahaha, I’m not sure that you want to hear me sing. But I am pretty good in the kitchen.”
    Me: “Stir-fry is my specialty, but I’ve got some more recipes up my sleeve. When we grab a drink, you can hint what you prefer”

And my favorite: Girl with generic picture, no bio or bio consisting of a random emoji (Like what the hell is that supposed to mean)

These ones are tricky and are pretty common. Go back to what I wrote before. Why did you swipe on this girl? Is it because she’s cute? Is it because she’s throwing off good vibes? Does she seem like a genuinely good person? Take that thought and add a twist. It’s like a cold open, but for dating apps. If you meet someone IRL, you can ask them a question about something fun, or you can make an assumption about her. This works in dating apps as well, do that and let the conversation flow from there.

Examples:

“You seem like a fun person to be around, I’ll see if I’m right when we grab a drink”

“You seem like the athletic type, or did you just snap a cute picture to show off?”

Experiment with your openers, and don't be afraid to be daring. Don't play it safe, tease and have fun all while being respectable of the person you're talking to. By the end of the day, we're all here to enjoy ourselves.

**Getting her off the app**

You thought of a witty opener, and she responded. Great! Now what? 

Every person is different, some will give you a dry answer to your opener, some a “hahaha (add emoji here)”, some will give you some material to work with and some won’t answer (you can’t win them all). Your job is to get her off the app and into your phone/Snapchat/Instagram as smoothly as possible. Use texting as a means to an end, you’re not trying to build a connection via texting. You guys both swiped on each other. Take that as a hint that she’s attracted to you. My general rules of thumb to do this as effectively as possible are:

1.)	No interview questions- You’re not trying to get to know her. You’re trying to get her on a date, so you can meet up face to face and get to know her then. NOT VIA TEXTING. Imagine this scenario:

You’re a girl with 20 messages in your inbox. 10 of them say “hey” (or some variation of that). She answers 3 of those messages because the guys follow rule 1 to an insane degree. She looks at the other 10. One asks her “What do you do for work?” She answers a dry answer. Another, “What do you do for fun?” She answers another short response. “How do you enjoy spending your spare time?” She doesn’t answer and gets off the app. 

Texting shouldn’t be a chore and getting bombarded with questions isn’t fun. Interviews are dreadful enough, imagine if you got 10 interview questions every day. You probably wouldn’t answer them all, and eventually you wouldn’t bother with them all together. I'm guilty of texting the girl a lot before the date to get to know her. I learned that the effect is more negative than positive. If you don't have anything interesting to share or say, you're better off not texting at all.

2.)	Text with a purpose- What’s your goal? Why are you texting her? Imagine texting like a path from point A to point B. Your job is to get from Point A (matching) to Point B (a date) as smoothly as possible. Don't make the mistake and mindlessly text her like I used to, navigate the conversation towards that. One way I like to do it is:

    Me: “(Some statement on something we talked about), I’ll see if I’m right when we meet up for a beer. Or are you more into wine?”
    Her: “I like both to be honest”
    Me: “And when we grab a drink next week, what would you prefer?”
    Her: “Hahaha, well it would honestly depend on my mood.”
    Me: “Give me your number and we’ll see when we can make that happen.”
    Her: “Haha #####”

Always think a step ahead on how to navigate your opener into fun banter, from fun banter to hinting that you should go out, and if you get a good response from her, get her number. 

3.)	Banter > Questions – Asking questions is good for one thing- to get the banter rolling. If you don’t have information to work with, asking a good question can get the ball rolling and can get her to share more, which gives you more information to work with, which leads to better banter, which leads to a better chance of you getting a number. I’ll use an example where I ended up double-texting after she didn’t respond and got a number (and eventually a date):

    Me: “Good thing my A/C is working so I can chill after being let out to dry”(Bad translation)
    Her: “Sorry, I didn’t see your message”
    Me: “Happens to the best of us. So how does your athletic side come into play?” (I assumed before that she had an athletic side to her)
    Her: “I was on the national gymnastics team.”
    Me: “Do you also do cartwheels and handstands on random objects in your apartment?”
    Her: “Hahahaha not really, I’ve gotten lazy”
    Me: “Too bad, that could’ve been a sight to behold. How about we get off this app and you give me your number?”
    Her: “Haha alright ######”

4.)	Close on a high note – Don’t ask for a number out of the blue, because if you do that, you’ll mostly be brushed off, or worse, get ghosted. Look at the examples above. If you get a good laugh from her or if she’s responsive towards going out with you, it’s a good sign to try and close her number/social media. She’s much more likely to give to you as well. Worst case scenario she says no, brush it off and change the subject.


**Setting up a Date**

Congrats! You’ve charmed her and you’ve got her phone number (I don’t do Snapchat or IG personally). Send her a text with a GIF (bitches love GIFs) or something witty and try setting up logistics. I’ll walk you through my thought process:

Ask her out to X activity on date Y, her response is...:

**Yes:** Great! You’re all set, send her a text back that you’ll see her on date Y, you’re excited to see her or something sweet of the sort and end the conversation. Check back on her at the date that you’re going to meet up to make sure you’re set to meet up on that day.

**No, but I’m free on Z:** Great! If you’re free aswell, set up on that date and follow the directions above.

**No:** Okay, why did she say no?

**“I’m busy, I won’t be able to”** – Alright, at this point I’d brush it off and ask her when she’s available. If she doesn’t give me a definitive answer, I’ll 
send her something like: “That’s fine, hit me up and take care”, and stop talking to her. The ball’s in her court now and you shouldn’t be hounding girls 
who won’t make a little bit of effort to meet up. Remember, dating is a two-way street. Don't waste your time on people who won't give you the time of day.

If she does give you an answer, she’s interested and try setting up the date.

**“I get off work really late”/”I have to study until late”’/”I’m too tired” etc.** – This isn’t a hard no. She’s making excuses on why she can’t come. This is 
where persuasion comes in, convince her that you’re worth it, just make sure you’re not too pushy. I follow a rule I learned while I was working in sales: 

If I get one ""no""- Why did she say no? Agree with the reason and try to persuade and charm her otherwise. If you get a second no, drop it and talk to her at a different opportunity. Nothing is a bigger turn off than neediness, and the last thing you want is to pressure someone into doing something they're not comfortable with.

People are willing to sacrifice sleep and time if they believe they’re going to have a good time. I’ll share an example of something that happened to me last week, with a girl that lives 40 minutes from me (sadly I don’t have a car ATM):

(Background: We decided we’ll be spontaneous, that we’ll meet up today and she’ll drive to me, but it will depend on how she is after work)

    Her: Hey, I think I won’t make the drive today :( (Not cancelling yet, just thinking about it)
    Me: It’s all good, we’ll find a different time.
    Her: Sorry, I know it’s not very spontaneous of me.
    Me: I expected more from you, maybe I’ll see your spontaneous side at a different opportunity.
    Her: Haha always have low expectations, I have to find the energy to make the drive (Warming up a little)
    Me: Grab a cup of coffee and drive. Worst case scenario that you’re exhausted and can’t drive home, you can sleep on my comfy couch. (Teasing a bit)
    Her: Hahaha what?? Instead of offering me to sleep in your room you’re offering me the couch?
    Me: You can order me a drink first before you jump into my bed
    Her: Haha
    Me: Anyways, if you’re feeling spontaneous hit me up. I’m going back to my books to study, they need some attention.
    Her: They deserve it haha! Alright, I have 11 minutes to decide.
    Me: (Insert happy GIF)
    Her: Alright I’ll come.

If you've come this far, thank you for reading and I hope you found this useful. Good luck and happy dating!

How does someone go from ""talking to you makes me feel like I've known you for years"" to radio silence? And to add insult to injury, how do you not take that personally? 

The horrible thing about being ""ghosted"" is not the fact that a romance didnt spark, it's the ripping of the hope that we held out for your decency. And worst off, we make excuses for your newfound muteness. Then, we check our phones more than usual, hoping to hear from you or even see if you're online so we know that you're actually still alive. Only then, it hits us - you've decided to vanish. 

I wasted days thinking about someone who didnt value them. I think that's what it boils down to - the realisation that the high regard you held them to was not reciprocated.

* whether you believe you’re out of their league or you’re not (overall, not just in the looks department), ***you are right***. 

Confidence really is everything. And insecurity really kills boners and lady boners. 

* It’s a lot more feasible to follow Rules 1 and 2 than you believe — but it takes work

Sure, genetics rule all. 

But if you work out, get a fitting haircut, take care of yourself overall (nice skin, healthy skin color, healthy looking eyes, not-yellow teeth) and you show some sort of effort in fashion, you’ll be ahead of the curve so much that you’ll be considered physically attractive. 

I am not conventionally good-looking. But I workout, take care of myself, dress well when needed, and I’m an awesome person. 

I’ve gotten feedback such as “you’re fucking addicting” and “you’re extremely attractive...official 12/10 rating” and “no, you’re cute” (after I passively texted “oh that’s cute” to a dog pic) etc. 

But fret not...

* It’s like the worst-kept secret that guys typically take terrible pics 

...and the ones that take great ones usually disappoint and/or are narcissist (just from the many anecdotes I heard). 

I got so many “wow you look so much better than your pics” and “why do guys always take such bad pics?”

Because we are guys. 

Of course, that brings up the quandary of whether you should knowingly put up a bad pic or try too hard by putting up a try-hard pic. Obviously, the answer is neither — though even our best pics still don’t do us justice. 

But isn’t that better than being photogenic? Even for a dating app? Better that than disappointing someone IRL. 

* your first online messaging convo should be 10 minutes MAX

Just some flirting, some clear signals of attraction and suggestive comments for activities, then mention that you’re jumping off the app to do something else and — this is up to you — either give them your number or ask for theirs.

I’ve had great success just saying “k gotta go but we should totally [get pancakes for dinner] so text me at 9118675309” and like 80% of the time I get a text within 3 minutes, 95% of the time I get a text. 

* girls are way too good at taking pics. Beware. 

No body pics nearly always means they’re hiding it. You may be into it. You may not be. I’m just pointing it out. 

Even the hot girls don’t look as hot in person. 

Why?

Girls have literally 1000s of pictures of themselves, on average. Imagine their top 0.5%. They are not going to look their 99.5% best the first time nor every time. 

But that’s obviously ok. 

* There is such a thing as having too many dates and it’s a shitty thing to do

It just is. It’s narcissism. I had that streak. And I got my penance for it. I did shit like slept over at a tinder girl’s date then showed up at an 11am brunch date with a girl I actually liked 20 min late because the previous girl’s shower felt like Chinese water torture, and I showed up in the only clean shirt I had — that girl’s souvenir Toronto tourism T-shirt that smelled like a girl. 

But the worst was having to try to be mature and break it off with girls I had been on 3-4+ dates with.  

It broke me. It humbled me. I don’t ever want to feel that way again. No it’s not a good problem to have. What the fuck will you do with all the dates? Naturally you’ll be seeing like 4-5 people for the 3rd or 4th time — it just doesn’t work. 

* Do not talk dating with dates

Obvious. But not so much. I did this early and got punished and stopped. 

Many others still did this. 

* Hope for guys: the quality of the dating pool for girls may be deep in numbers but shallow in quality

So don’t worry about how there are so many guys. You cannot control that anyway.

Change what you have control over — yourself. 

* Personality goes a long fucking way

We all know this. Imagine being with a hot girl or guy who is vapid and stupid. Now imagine being with a moderately cute girl or guy who makes you laugh and makes your heart sink when her name pops up in your phone. 

* Improve yourself for you. Sincerely. Then, dating benefits will come 

I’m done convincing people of this. Either you get it or you don’t. But I’m comfortable calling this a truth. It works. Trust the process. But you should be doing it for yourself — you owe it to yourself. 

Here’s what scared me straight: imagining meeting a multiverse version of me who was the best version of me and picturing what he’d be like and how terrible he’d make me feel. I tried to become that guy. 

* Asian guys: stop making excuses

It’s not because you’re Asian. It’s because you’re letting it get to your head. 

I dated like 50/25/25 white/asian/other. All the girls were attractive physically. I even had a pseudo relationship with a hot black girl (until she tried to propose to me, yikes). 

Rid your insecurity and do away with excuses. And hitting the gym may help. 

But yeah, there are girls not into asian guys. But then again, this summer I heard at least from a dozen different girls “I never thought I’d _____ with an Asian guy.” 

Oh also, asian guys who are violently and/or emotionally abusive, go fuck yourselves. The stereotype is strong according to too many anecdotes. 

* Tinder has gotten worse very quickly, but Tinder Vegas is awesome

If you’re looking to just hook up in Vegas, fire up that Tinder and spring for Gold. 

I feel like Tinder in Vegas brings the app back to its roots: a user base comprising mostly young and hot people looking for no strings hooking up. 

Just put in your bio you’re in Vegas for XYZ period. It will work. And like 9/10 profiles are HOT. 

As mentioned I was 35 now 36, and hooked up with two smoking hot girls (age 26 was fine but age 23 made me feel a bit creepy...until we were hooking up...what?) back to back nights and we haven’t talked since.

* If you’re looking for relationships, CMB and Hinge worked well for me

Bumble must run on college interns because Bumble was fine early May then just got worse and worse over the summer. 

I get high quality matches and likes on Hinge for free. 

I get high volume and occasional high quality matches on CMB. 

Tinder is hit or miss. 

* Value NOT “shared interests” but ***shared principles***

No one gives a shit if you guys both like At The Drive-In or Godspeed You Black Emperor.  Congrats, you both listen to the ultimate hipster music before hipsters were a thing. Who cares?

I already have people in my life who share interests with me, people with whom I get along well — they’re called friends. 

You want to share relationship and life-outlook principles with your significant other. Quoting your favorite GB Shaw quote during a fight won’t do shit. 

If anything, having different interests makes it more fun. Lots of new things to try. And you know it’s real when you find yourself staring at her as she discusses her hobby passionately and you just keep thinking of how to participate with her or get her something thoughtfully related as a gift. 

* actions speak louder than words

What they say matters little. What they do matters a lot. 

We should know this by now. 

This is how I knew the one I’m with now is the one I want to be with for the long haul: she was the 31st different girl I had met, and I had a second date after a great first one — and for the first and only time, I showed up to a date 15 minutes early instead of 1-2 min early or late. I did it because I really liked her. She noticed (since I was picking her up) and she later told me she saw it as a good sign from me. 

* it’s not them it’s you

More times than not, this is the answer to “why can’t I find anyone?”

* it’s much better to show physical affection early than to play it safe

This is how you get ghosted even by people who liked you. 

No surprise, many girls (and everyone else) like to feel wanted. 

Don’t play games, don’t play it safe, don’t be gross. You’re on a date. You already find each other attractive. 

**SHE COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE THAT MOMENT WITH SOMEONE ELSE OR NOTHING AT ALL...BUT SHE IS THERE WITH YOU ON PURPOSE**

Yes it’s from Hitch. Doesn’t mean he’s not right. 

The date is yours to fuck up. Everything is in place. 

Little things like putting your hand on her back or shoulder blade for two seconds, or grabbing her hand to help her out of the car, or a playful slap of her arm. They work. 

Also, pick up on cues. If she’s on your left and totally moving her hair to the other side while talking to you, she is giving you signs. Too many signs to list. Research them. Act on them. 

You may get rejected, sure. 

Better than being ghosted and “not knowing” where it went wrong. 

* Don’t lie 

Duh. It’s a lose lose. If you get serious with her, she will find out. It’s also social and sexual fraud. 

* The One doesn’t exist. But Your One does. And that person may be online, or you might meet that person in real life. 

I didn’t learn this so much as it just reaffirmed something that didn’t need reaffirming. 

Stop looking for him or her. Fate nor destiny doesn’t exist. There is no grand plan. There is no cupid. Etc. 

This is all comforting. It means that it’s in our own hands. (Sure, “luck” is involved, but not so much luck as it is just fortuitous timing and placement in a completely chaotic world where we have virtually no control over what happens, and even then, we have no knowledge of what could have been or what could be). 

But the bottom line is that you don’t have to worry about there being only one or “the only one” out there — the only thing you should and can worry about is what you can control: yourself (your self-identity, your appearance and grooming and hygiene and style and look, your fitness shape, parts of your personality that are more pliable and definitely the negative traits, etc). 

For me to have met my current (and likely last) SO, sooooo many things outside of my control had to have happened. Even if, for example, I happened to show up to my yoga class 5 minutes later that day then she and I 100% wouldn’t have ever met since she went to my class for the first and only time, and I met her ***in real life*** (poetic how I spend all this time and effort and money on online dating only to find My One**^2** through in-person interaction).  

What I could control was my fitness, appearance, my sense of humor, and the ability to muster up enough “courage” to ask her out after a yoga class (probably what some/many girls would just hate happening in their yoga classes, especially if more men came just to make it “a place for guys to meet and ask out girls” but I legitimately do yoga twice a week to balance out my exercises). 

**And she said yes**. (And I don’t think that’ll be the last time I’ll say those 4 words about her and me asking her an important yes/no question; though technically she “rejected me” when I asked if she wanted to grab some coffee afterwards only to find me on FB that night — we had talked a little bit outside before class began — and apologize and explain that she was a bit taken aback and flattered and blushing when I asked her out, and that she mainly said “no” because she “felt gross and sweaty” after hot yoga, but that she wanted to grab dinner instead...and the rest is hopefully history forever in the making)

As I said, SO many things had to happen for us to even date. None of that I could control. But I could’ve been a disheveled slob and likely not gotten a date with her even if the stars aligned...but I can control whether or not I look presentable. 

* Bottom line: it’s chaotic out there, online and in the real world. Take solace in the fact that you can only worry about what you can control, and relative to the chaos, there’s very little to control 

Again, just physically, you can turn yourself from a 5/10 or 6/10 — depending on just how “off” you are with grooming yourself or how bad your haircut is etc — into even an 8.5/10 or something. 

**Step 1**: get a proper and possibly new hair style/cut. GO TO AN EXPENSIVE STYLIST JUST ONCE TO GET A RECOMMENDATION. Even a place that costs $35 for a haircut. They’ll tell you what best fits you. 

A haircut can make you look like a bum while another can make you look handsome AF. Compare World War Z Brad Pitt to Oceans 13 Brad Pitt, Limitless Bradley Cooper to Limitless Bradley Cooper after he has “cleaned up,” or *NSYNC Justin Timberlake to Justin Timberlake, or John Krasinski in the early seasons of The Office to his final season...and he keeps getting better looking now that he’s RIPPED....

**Step 2^^: hit the gym and watch what you eat. You don’t have to go full John Krasinski but there’s like a 95% chance that you can improve your physical health/looks, whether it’s trimming some fat, gaining some muscle, ridding yourself of the cancer patient look, dripping down from obesity, etc. 

Biologically, women are *generally* attracted to “healthy looks,” like good skin color, healthy shape, healthy hair/skin, ample muscle tone, etc. Many of these things help with producing better offspring and protecting the offspring. 

**Step 3**: Overhaul your wardrobe if it “sucks.” Hell, you can spend a few hundred dollars at H&M and have enough “stylish” clothes for years as a guy. 

There’s no single style. Pick one that suits both your personality and body type. Maybe you like skinny jeans but you’re overweight — don’t do it. Maybe you like the grunge look but weigh 130lbs at 5’8”. Well you can’t even wear loose flannel without looking like a girl who slept over at a guy’s house. 

Pick out stylish clothes that accentuate your best features. I have a strong jaw line and high cheek bones, so I keep my hair rather short and choose shirts and jackets that have collars that accentuate my jawline. I have nice arms and shoulders apparently (I had better have them, I worked out for them), and I often get complimented about them because I wear NOT *tight* shirts but shirts just loosely above “fitted” where it’s almost like I’m hiding them. 

**Step 4**: General grooming 

Accentuate your features, but also choose a style that matches your personality and life stage. Don’t be wearing lettermen jackets if you’re 38, unless you look young or are black (in which case they look young too). 

Grow a beard if your jawline is “missing.” Shave if you have a jawline and/or can’t grow a glorious beard. 

Cut your hair short or shave it if you’re balding. Grow it long if you have a small head and round face. Cut your hair if you have a square face and/or jawline, as long hair looks AWFUL on square jaws. 

Have the right facial hair. If you can’t grow it fully just go clean. 

Shower shower shower. Not just on date nights. Bacteria accumulate. You don’t want to have trouble getting rid of BO because you haven’t showered in 4 days. 

Wear clean clothes. 

Footwear is important. Don’t wear the same 2-3 pairs of shoes unless all 3 are very different, fashionable, clean, and they can match your clothes. And this applies only to first and second dates. Don’t wear your Jordan’s for a second time on your 4th date...at a steakhouse. That shit may have flown on your second date playing mini-golf and going casual because it’s summer and outdoors but good god man have some shoes that you can wear at a place that has cloth that doesn’t have unlimited breadsticks. And no, work shoes don’t count. 

FIND YOUR *OWN* SCENT. Believe it or not, that Light Blue cologne from Dolce & Gabana that you believe smells great? Yeah, only like 10,000 other guys in your area think so, too....and thus, it’s popular. You don’t want to end up smelling like everyone else. 

You can still wear popular colognes but I suggest ***trying Axe body spray*** to BLEND, not MIX or COMBINE, the scents. 

Yes.  Body spray. For 2 reasons (if you need another, I’ve had at least 5 girls tell me I smell great unprompted on dates, and another 4-5 friends say the same)

1) Reddit will tell you that Axe is for 13-year olds. Largely, they’re correct. But you’re not using it as your catch-all tool to smell like you’ve showered. You’re using it as a non-cologne fragrance undertone to blend with your cologne and make something totally ***unique as a fragrance that girls can only associate with you***. Of course, this matters more with girls you go on 3rd+ dates with or are in a relationship with. The body spray goes UNDER your outfit while the cologne outside if, with some cologne underneath. Small dabs though. 

2) you want to smell good naked, not just like deodorant but body spray and a hint of cologne, whereas with clothes on you want to smell like cologne with hints of body spray. 

Just do NOT smell like the last guy she just had dinner with. You WILL encounter that if you just wear cologne from Macy’s (nothing at all against Macy’s; they have all colognes that even the stores themselves don’t carry in stock, but it also means many men go there and buy the same ones you’re wearing). 

* **FINALLY: yes, self-improvement is the key. But do not do it for anyone but yourself. Do it for dating and you will never attain the level of improvement you need. It’s a catch 22. Thankfully.**

**TLDR: either you read it or didn’t. It’s your dating life. These are words from someone who dated nearly 3 dozen girls in a short time and learned a great deal.**


———————————————————–

**^1**

I’m fortunate to have been able to date at all. Yes I was the best version of myself. But...

First off, I’m an Asian guy — strike 1 for online dating, I’m 36 — strike 2, and my pictures are all years old because I don’t take selfies and I’ve had to I untagged myself from many Facebook pics during a job search a half decade ago — strike 3. Many will tell you that being an Asian guy alone = zero dates, and many will tell you being over 30 and especially 35 will hinder you, nope...still got dates. Oh, and I used pics from like 2011...which many girls called misleading because....well, I’ve gotten countless comments on me being “far more attractive” in person (someone even rated me as a 12/10). 

**^2**

Yeah it’s early but while age is just a number, it can also be an indicator of dating and relationship experience. We are both around our mid-30s, but no kids or divorces....just bad “luck,” and we both have and had zero desperation in finding a partner because we were both on the verge of taking a break from dating...

...but we managed to bump into each other and we are already in ***marriage***-talk mode, which, if we weren’t in our 30s with extensive dating and LTR experience each and we were 24 instead, we’d probably be focused more on ***wedding***-talk, as the former focuses more on how we’d operate as partners and things we notice that makes us great partners and the latter focuses on just being swept up in love — or infatuation — and *getting married* instead of *staying married*....it’s just two young kids not wanting a good thing to stop, without thinking about how the good thing can last and how much work it takes. My Also, since my SO and I have had many LTRs, this is one of the cases where we have bot the “just know” feeling but we’ve also logically thought it out)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/9cm0rj/here_is_what_i_learned_in_my_112_active_days_of/,409,"Yeah i mix up aventus and old spice for deodorant.

Shallow, I know, but just FYI. I still go out on the dates, and 100% always act the gentleman part. It is how I was raised and what I always aspire to when being the best me. All my dates deserve the best me, even if they’re not giving me their best. It’s how I always see what a true gentleman is.

Doubled my salary, have my own side business, work out all the time, have my own place etc. Generally happy, feeling good, like life is going somewhere. I have the money to go out and buy nice clothes and shit, etc. 

But my dating life has gone to shit. I haven't met anyone in the past two years that all this has been going on. When I ask people in IRL, they seem to cringe at me. I go on dates, but it's like, nobody is interested in a person who has their life on track? All I get is ghosted or rejected. 

3-4 years ago I was broke, depressed, never took care of myself, etc. and I had women throwing themselves at me, like would sleep with several a year, etc. I dressed like a bum, dirty sneakers, oversized clothing, did nothing but play video games, etc. Despite being a 'loser' through all my 20s, I always had girlfriends. 

What the fuck is up with this world? all you ever here is 'improve yourself if you want to date', except, I did, and now it sucks. It doesn't matter that objectively I'm way more attractive and feel more confident... if nobody will actually date me? I don't understand how my happiness is such a rabid turn off to people.

This should be the first step because realistically a lot of dating problems can be fixed with more mindfulness and intentionality by all parties involved.

BUT **there is a difference between an issue that just requires some communication and effort from both parties and an issue that is just a testament to how much two people should not be together.** Sometimes they are just not into you and/or vice versa and no amount of communication will fix that fact.

Someone that is into you will listen, speak on their side of the issues, and encourage you to work with them to find a middle ground, compromise or solution because to them, being with you is something they value and enjoy and see most problems trying to impede that as worth fixing. You will both make attempts to meet each other's needs.

With someone who is not into you, you will feel the need to communicate the same exact issue again and again and you'll be met with either verbal promises that never actually materialize, or they will react negatively to seemingly natural requests, e.g lashing out and making you feel bad for bringing a reasonable request up, or they'll just ignore it.

I'm sharing this as someone who learned it the hard way.

TL/DR: Pay attention to how people respond to your needs and how you respond to theirs.

419,e7cupm,False,Venting,131,Anyone else feel horrible for not being successful in dating? (24 M),dating,"I’m so sick of it. I hear so many comments about not having a girlfriend from my family and coworkers. Either they’ll ask why I’m not getting dates despite explaining myself so many times, or they find ways to make comments about it in conversation. They act like it’s the easiest thing in the world, they’ll say “just go on tinder” even though I’ve made it clear that I’m not comfortable with the idea of hookups, not that I would even be able to get them. 

The worst part is that everyone is absolutely enthralled by my younger brother, he’s the little darling of our family even though all he does is constantly pump and dump chicks like some kind of pickup artist. He’s a beefy jock type so it makes sense that he’d have more success. But I just feel like they’re always trying to compare me to him because the rest of the family (especially the men) are a lot more like him than me. It’s always been that way. I’m usually the lightning rod everyone gangs up on. 

Here’s the thing. I’m smaller, I’m nerdy, I’m less outgoing. I like to stay inside and read books or discuss various topics. I like myself though. I don’t want to change. I’m sick of feeling like everyone wants me to though and that to be a valid man I have to attract women and to attract women I have to be a certain way. 

You know, I’ve tried. I’ve approached so many women. I believe I have a lot to offer and that I’m not a loser, so I don’t have confidence problem. Whats bothering me is the endless rejections I have come to expect. I’ve kind of given up at this point because I always just know I’ll get rejected. It really hurts constantly feeling worthless and lonely, after a while you begin to think there must be something mentally wrong with you. But you can’t find the reason and that drives you crazy so you try on all these different philosophies about dating but none of them really ever fit.

Now I just want to be left alone to not date and tell people I’m just not really interested. But maybe I’m the biggest hypocrite of all because that’s a greasy lie. The truth is, late at night all I can think about is how nice it would be just to know that somebody I like actually likes me back. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/e7cupm/anyone_else_feel_horrible_for_not_being/,400,"Maybe some therapy would help? If you can’t afford it, there’s plenty of free online resources to help maybe evaluate your behavior and reflect if you might be doing something wrong. 

Example: (This one guy I was friends with for more than 5 years...great friend initially but I pity the fool who ends up with him. ) This guy comes from a divorced family where mom left. Christian and very dismissive about women. (I’m guessing his mother got tired of the abuse and just got up and decided to leave all her 8 children. Idk) 

One day said he would just buy a wife. He would take all of these girls on dates to see if they would like them and then when they would start to, he’d drop them. 

One day I helped him move and it was raining outside so he offered to drop me off closer to where there was cover from the rain. He then said, “oh you just wanna use me” and then made me walk in the rain with him. He would brag about trying to use his ex-girlfriend because her family was loaded. He talks about getting a girlfriend like it’s buying a toy. 
Things just got worse with him and he became a worse friend so I just stopped seeing him altogether. 

My evaluation of him is that this guy doesn’t even know what a healthy relationship looks like considering all the abuse he’s faced at home and NOW he’s tired of being alone and looking for someone to project all of those insecurities and trauma onto...when in reality he really has a lot of bad behaviors he needs to clean up.

There are so many friends of mine who many would not consider to be attractive at all. However there demeanor and attitude and manners is what has everyone falling for them. Human behavior never changes. We’re just becoming more lazy and want instant gratification for our approaches.

It may not seem like such a big deal if you're the type of person who constantly has new options to milk and attempt to win with, but it's actually really rough for those of us who have to wait months between decent chances of getting anywhere near a win. It's especially rough when one of these chances just turns out to be someone wasting our time or simply using us for whatever secondary objective they're really after.

What's sad is that if we could all grow a spine, communicate with one another like grown, responsible adults, and treat each other's feelings like we'd like our own to be treated this game wouldn't be so nasty and difficult.

425,caih1t,False,Giving Advice,282,I’ve “settled” before; here’s what happened. (Female Perspective),dating,"I’m a 28 yo female. Currently single and I’m just here to give a little story about a long-term relationship where I felt I was “settling” and describe how it went. 

I don’t really like using the term settle when describing this relationship or just any relationship for that matter because it has a negative connotation making it sound like ‘ohh I gave in and said yes to the ugly but nice guy’ - that’s not what happened in the story I’m about to tell and I find that in most cases where women and even men feel as though they are settling, it’s not a matter of he/she isn’t good enough, it’s that he/she isn’t the right person. 

I was 23 when I met him (were going to call him Ryan). It was a tinder date. I had pretty good luck on tinder. I met zero creeps, I met very decent professional guys, I matched with most of the guys I had swiped right on (of course not all wanted a relationship and I was respectful of that, I wasn’t offended, I understand what these dating apps are for - just politely told them that’s not what I was looking for or just didn’t pursue anything).

Online dating can be fun and very useful, especially for someone like me who’s pretty shy and introverted (but opinionated and definitely not submissive). Obviously physical appearance is the first thing anyone notices but then comes all the other important attributes (interests, lifestyle, goals/ambitions, etc.) and I do my ‘swiping’ based on the criteria I see/like in that order, especially because I’m doing this for serious dating (side note: tinder was not as saturated in 2015 as it is now. And I no longer use it for dating, due to the many fake/spam profiles). 

So here’s how I’d separate the guys I’m “swiping right on” - there are guys: 

- I really really REALLY like 

- I definitely do like

- I kind of like 

Ryan was a guy I kind of liked. He was a good looking guy (but not my type - dont scrutinize me, I’m allowed to have a type). He was smart with multiple degrees, and I could tell from the look in his eyes/face that he was a genuinely good guy (I ended up being right). We matched. He was easy to talk to/text. He was very quick in asking me out and since I was very eager to get into dating and hopefully meeting someone and getting serious with them, I said yes. Even though I wasn’t really that into him, I thought it wouldn’t hurt. 
Our date went good. He was very very easy to talk, I felt comfortable around him. I had fun. He was really good at ‘courting me’ (hate that word lol but ya). He was a gentleman. I learned that he had a really good job, he was financially stable at age 25! And he wasn’t bad looking. 6 ft, physically in shape, dressed well, well-spoken, great guy! I went home that night not really thinking or feeling anything. I just fell asleep like it was any other night. This story is getting too long.... so we eventually started dating. About a month in I broke up with him because it just didn’t feel right. But then two weeks later, I started to feel alone and I called him and said we’re not getting back together but let’s just go on a date and see what happens. We eventually continued dating..... It was very on and off because I struggled a lot with our intimate life, I had a really really hard time getting into it with him and we really tried everything.... even therapy....

Now I know everyone’s going to wonder why we didn’t just break up for good? Well on my end, it was hard because I had found such a great guy, who understood me, loved me, cared for me, was ALWAYS there for me, he was such an amazing friend to me and that was the problem, he was more like my bestest closest friend that I didn’t want to kiss and have sex with but I did it anyways because he desired me in that way and I felt that I should be doing this because he’s my boyfriend and this is what people do in romantic relationships. I was very open with him about my feelings and had expressed my struggles very clearly from the beginning and he would react by going from being frustrated and resenting me to completely ignoring what I was saying and being in denial about it because he had a bit of a superiority complex (it wasn’t that intolerable, I teased him about it quite often actually) so because of that, he had a hard time even comprehending that someone wouldn’t be “into him” but I’m sure part of him also felt hurt because his feelings/desires were not being reciprocated (at least not genuinely).
The craziest thing was, he was willing to stay with me, he never even considered breaking up as an option, he wanted to make it work and I just went along with it until I couldn’t. 

Our relationship lasted 1.5 years in total with many many breaks in between. We did a lot together. We traveled, stayed in and drank wine, cooked together, ate out at fancy restaurants, he gifted me many many beautiful things. But we also had our ugly moments too. Arguments about my feelings (or lack there of), our awkward sex life (sorry for tmi but I would mainly stay dry to the point where it actually hurt - I never had this issue with anyone else). Toward the end, he loved me but hated me at the same time. We ended on bad terms and don’t speak. I never regret our breakup. I felt suffocated and confused. I had met a decent guy who treated me well and loved me and wanted to give me the world but I just couldn’t bring myself to be into him. I found myself fantasizing about random men all the time while I was with him. He took me “ring browsing” at Tiffany’s once and as excited as I was I kept thinking “why am I here with him? I want this but not with him”, it was awful. I always felt this void. 

So here’s why I wasn’t attracted to him even though he wasn’t considered an unattractive guy. It’s because I have my preferences just like anyone else and sometimes (like in my situation) it’s NOT OKAY to ignore these “preferences”. It’s what we desire. I’m not saying it’s the only thing that matters, but it does matter and shouldn’t be ignored. I learned my lesson. I gave a guy that I wasn’t attracted to a chance and it didn’t work for me. 

So what I took away from that experience was not to swipe right on someone I kind of like. What I do now when I meet a potential someone in person or come across a potential profile on a dating site, I immediately picture myself having really hot passionate sex with them and if I like it and it excites me then I continue with reading their profile and deciding whether or not there’s potential. I know it sounds crazy but it’s helped me avoid situations like the one I described above. 

Now I feel like I’m going to get backlash for the passionate sex thing. People will say things like... oh well... women are only going to feel that with the “top 20% of hot men”. NO. That’s not true. Men on here really don’t give themselves any credit. They bag on themselves more than us women do. Maybe the guy I get excited for when picturing myself having really hot sex with doesn’t look like a Calvin Klein model with a perfect hairline and abs (I actually prefer an average body-type honestly) so don’t say things like that. That guy Ryan I dated, he used to get checked out by girls allll the time when we were out and I always felt confused honestly, I didn’t understand why I couldn’t see what they saw.

It’s a Hallmark holiday. Not significant. Just another day. Single isn’t a good thing for everyone some are okay with it others have been looking for years but usually find that every year gone by more traditional love and dating are out the window. I don’t think I’ll find anyone significant in this country. It’s all games and lack of commitment. Romantic love is like a unicorn and usually fades after seven years. Even between friends. I’ve found that European girls are fast to commit and have a better idea of what kind of guy they like. If after a decade has anyone considered that their SO may exist in another continent. I think it’s funny how contained men are in the states yet you go to places around the world men are free to love and express. Girls in the states preach for more sensitivity and expression yet we find ourselves constantly undermined and understood and largely under appreciated. I’m talking to all the blue collar guys who can’t get a girl to commit due to pop culture and the popularization of man hopping. I refuse to be a serial dater I don’t think it’s becoming. I also don’t find high count in girls progressive. It’s a bit a red flag for most guys since most guys count are naturally low.  I think dating apps bring the wrong people together. The good guys don’t bother and you end up seeing them pass up girls who are interested in them because of low enthusiasm in the whole idea. All for women doing as they please but ladies are you really happy? Do you ever think you could have had it good with an ex had you committed. I have a female friend who always talks about her powerful ex husband who if she had wisened up or understood her way she could have had it all.

While the media is bringing only negative, toxic news to your mindset, I will tell you how you can come out of this crisis more sociable and with more confidence than before.

When was the last time you were forced to sit at home with plenty of time, no restaurant to go to, no activity to do outside and no distractions?

Right now is the perfect time to look at your life and ask yourself:

Am I happy with my life?

Do I feel fulfilment in my relationships?

Do I feel lonely?

How would this crisis be different if I had a person by my side whom I care about?

Sometimes life gives you a chance to review the way you are living. Don't take it as a thing that is ''bad''. You have the opportunity to self-reflect and set some goals - Don't waste it with binge-watching Netflix. 

The choice is yours. 

Do you want to come out of this crisis the same as before? Nothing will have changed. Except that you will have watched every series on Netflix.

436,df2u2r,False,I Need Advice,177,"I [21 M] have absolutely no idea how to meet new women without potentially creeping them out, how do you meet strangers these days?",dating,"So I really struggle with dating. I’m 21, a little socially awkward, not entirely ugly but I’m a short ass, which doesn’t help me with tinder or other online dating apps. I don’t really like them anyway, I do get some matches, but they never go anywhere at all. It feels so hard to get to know someone that way. I’ve come to realise the big issue for me is that I see hundreds of women who catch my eye, but approaching them in a way that is sensitive to the fact that they deal with creepy, shitty guys day in day out, and managing to break past that barrier and get to know them is basically impossible. Because of this, I just never try get to know girls I think are attractive. It just seems like a crazy idea to me at this point. I should probably mention to begin with that I completely understand that women tend to have their guard up around guys they don’t know for a very sensible and understandable reason. It’s the creepy pieces of shit who go out their way to terrorise women that are the root cause of all this. it’s completely normal to feel like this. I feel however that this is a problem not just for me, but probably hundreds of normal, everyday guys out there, who mean well but just have no idea how to approach women while being respectful of how weird it is to be approached by a stranger.

Like, how the fuck do people meet each other these days man? It’s a mystery to me. After school finishes it just becomes seemingly impossible to meet anyone to date. In class at college I try keep to myself, and try not to sit next to any girls I find interesting cause I don’t want to be that creep that sits trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get a degree. I wouldn’t want to date a co-worker, for obvious reasons. Online dating completely sucks as a way to meet someone unless you’re intrinsically good looking, especially for guys. Average looking guys just dont get that many matches, and women get too much to the point that they have to be pretty picky about who they want to match with. It’s kind of a broken system. I’ve never been the type to try have a drunken hookup with some girl I meet in a club, again people just aren’t that attracted to me until they see a glimpse of my personality, and that can take time, and it’s hard to get that across shouting over the music at some stranger you don’t know. That leaves the same group of girls I’ve been friends with for years, who I see most weekends and have had some flirtations with over the years, but I know that none of them really see me as dating material. I’m at a point in my life where I need to meet some new girls and start dating, but I’m completely stumped as to how to even go about it.

It basically leaves a few options that all just seem crazy. Basically, just approaching any girl you find interesting or ‘sliding into the dms’ of someone you kind of vaguely know, which just seem ridiculous to me. Like no girl wants to be approached by some random guy when they’re going about their business, and no girl wants some stupid reply guy filling their dm’s up with stupid hollow attempts to get to know them.

I really just don’t have a clue how to meet girls. I’m not a completely lost cause; I’m not some fedora wearing neckbeard. I’m a little socially awkward, and it can take time to get to know me, but aren’t we all like that? It’s just that the girls I know well have known me for so long they see me as just a friend, a drunken hookup at the very very best, and me being a little socially awkward means that meeting new people is something I overthink to hell. I see what girls put up with all the time, with random guys approaching them on nights out and hopelessly trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get on with their day, and I never want to do that. So, my question is: how the fuck do you meet people to date? It sounds simple, but it’s completely beyond me. I just wish it was as simple as seeing a girl you’re attracted to, saying hey, and getting to know them. I wish the world could be that friendly, but everyone has their guard up these days (for good reason) and it just doesn’t work that way man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/df2u2r/i_21_m_have_absolutely_no_idea_how_to_meet_new/,383,[removed] ,2019-10-08 17:01:23

440,c6cbkr,False,Giving Advice,92,Attachment Theory and why modern dating sucks,dating,"So I love psychology and was recommended this book called ""attached. the new science of adult attachment and how it can help you find and keep love"". I read it all in 2 days and learned a lot about myself but also my previous partners. I will be putting some ideas from the book mixed with personal experience and what I've been seeing on this subreddit.

First there is a thing called attachment theory which is how we connect with others and how we interact in relationships. There are Four types of attachment styles: Secure, anxious, avoidant, and anxious-avoidant. I unknowingly fell in the anxious-avoidant and it has led me to not find a fulfilling relationship. 

A secure attachment person has healthy expectations for a relationship and can communicate their needs and desires. Note that having needs and expectations is a good thing and not something to be looked down for. A lot of advice I've seen on the page is about not having expectations. The people often asking for advice are asking how to bring up communications or desires which secure people already know how to. This makes up a pretty decent size of the population, i'd say about 50%. These are the people who easily find themselves in a healthy relationship. This doesn't mean they will always be in a healthy one and may end up staying in a unhealthy one because they can forgive their SO and don't keep count against them. They may also be able to communicate and their actions may lead to some changes in their SO but their SO (who is one of the other 3) may fix it temporarily and then fall victim to their attachment style. These are the types of people who are upfront about what they want or need in a relationship early on, have healthy boundaries, and will not deal with games early on.

An anxious attachment person will be constantly seeking attachment and commitment. They are very sensitive to negative signals. They can feel when someone is losing interest, any change will cause an alarm, and they may come off as ""clingy"". When their alarms go off that they may lose their partner or potential love interests they need to be calmed down and if they're not they may do things like over text, call, get mad, etc... They're fearful and may lash out. Some may try to punish their love interest to teach them to never do that again. They don't communicate their needs clearly out of fear of scaring their partner away from them. They make up about 25% of the population.

An avoidant attachment person is afraid of commitment. This person may do really well until they feel ""pressure"" or ""too close"". They may be proud of their independence and don't want to rely on anyone else. This can go to an extreme where they stop paying attention to their Love Interest out of belief that they should also be self-reliant. These people are the type to ghost after someone says they love them or they are showing large amounts of affection toward their  Love Interest. They don't communicate their need for space or for things to slow down. They rather do things to keep their Love Interest at arms length.

Anxious-Avoidant are a combination of anxious and avoidant. These are people who really want a relationship and they get anxious that their love isn't reciprocated so they push away and claim to be self-reliant. 

So what happens when each of these interact with each other?

Anxious vs avoidant tend to be a pull push cycle. Anxious person seeks closeness and tries to get closer while avoidant pushes the other away.

anxious vs anxious may end up in an extremely codependent relationship who are always walking on eggshells with each other.

Avoidant vs avoidant tend to fuck and leave. Never really committing and always looking for something better or just not communicating that they wish they could stay but are afraid.

Secure vs Avoidant are capable of lasting. Secure may not deal with someone wishy washy like an avoidant forcing the avoidant to either run away or deal with their shit. Secure may also give avoidant the space needed for a healthy relationship to be built. 

Secure vs Anxious are also capable of lasting. the secure can communicate to the anxious and ease their tension. The anxious may also push the secure to extremes or get bored of the secure because there is no emotional rollercoaster.

&#x200B;

So what does any of this have to do with online dating? Well the anxious and avoidant people are going to be recycled on these apps because their actions keep them on the dating market. Secure people are more picky and may commit once they find someone worth their time.

So how does one fix this issue? Simply communicate your needs and desires. If you're seeing someone and start freaking out, calmly say what's going on with you and what you need from them. Make sure you date secure people and people who are putting in the effort. It's already hard enough finding someone who like to spend time with but dealing with someone's attachment style is hard if you're not a good fit. Figure out which one you are and work on fixing it.

tldr online dating sucks because insecure people stay recycled on those apps. Figure out which one you are and learn to communicate.

442,dmizzz,False,Venting,121,What the fuck is wrong with people?,dating,"I've posted about this guy I met last month a few times so I won't go into too much detail but I am passed the point of feeling sad and onto being pissed off and just disappointed. 

I met a guy in early September and we hit it off very well in messages. We hit it off even better in texts, he was so attentive and sweet, and this was before we even met. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is. We met and he could not have been more excited and expressive about how he felt. When we parted ways after our first date, he told me he already missed me. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is.

So this kinda stuff continues. He tells me to leave a goddamn toothbrush at his house the first time I stayed over (and 2nd time we hung out) because he just *knew* we would be spending a lot of time together. He can't wait to introduce me to his friends, he wanted to wait to sleep together because he didn't want to rush and ruin things, etc. etc. Hindsight is 20/20, and maybe this all should have been a warning but I guess I thought it was genuine excitement. Even though I was a little like ""WHAT""...I felt very similar and I ate it up.

He got distant and cancelled plans that he set up. I try not to read into it and didn't mention any concerns until it was twice in a week. He assured me over the phone and in person when we saw each other again that he was still just as interested and he just got busy and stressed. I left it at that. He made another plan. Then cancelled that plan. He didn't talk much the week of that and went away for the weekend. Sent weird, confusing texts and at that point I was like, ok what the hell is going on??

I got no straight answers. I told him very clearly, if he isn't interested that he needs to be fair to me and just tell me so. I thought we both enjoyed hanging out and that we wanted to keep doing so and get to know each other. I got no response to that so I took that as my answer that he wasn't interested in dating me. I then later on was told that I was wrong in thinking that. 

I took a few days to not give any energy to the situation and came back to see what the fuck was happening. Why he can't just say what's on his fucking mind like an adult. If you act weird and someone questions it, just say what is going on. He tells me that we should meet up and talk and get on the same page. I let him know if it's something he can say over the phone, there is no need for a meet up. Because the whole ""we need to talk"" thing is making me think it's because he doesn't feel the same way that I do. Once again, I am told that I am wrong and he wants to explain things. 

The day comes to meet up. I am anxious as fuck and wondering if this is all even worth it. But I'm very curious as to what he has to say. An hour before he texts me that he is not coming. That he doesn't feel comfortable. That I was being too serious before. That he scares easily. 

WHAT. THE. FUCK is wrong with people. So you come on strong, get distant and weird and I question it and that's me being too serious about things? A big part of why we clicked is because I thought we were on the same page about dating. How the fuck am I going to get to know someone if I don't spend any time with them. Okay, cancel on me once or twice, things come up and life gets hectic. I get that. But again and again, yes I am going to question if this is something you want to pursue. I gave him multiple chances to say he was too busy at the moment to date. Or he lost interest. Or he met someone else. Be a fucking adult and tell someone that. Playing games and sending cryptic messages for weeks is not the way to act. ESPECIALLY when the weeks before that was nothing but great conversations and great dates and future fucking planning. 

What is wrong with someone like him? What the fuck could not be said. What is so fucking scary? How do you tell someone you think you need to talk, then tell them you need to talk BEFORE YOU TALK? What a colossal waste of my time, my energy, my feelings. 

I did like him, too. Through most of that shit I still liked him. And I'm not going to say I acted cool and collected the whole time. I eventually lost my cool and send some long winded texts. But nothing crazier than all the shit he said to me when we met. Yet, it comes back on me. And then I start to wonder if I did something wrong along the way, that scared him off. But fuck that thinking, I liked someone and I wanted to spend time with them. I thought that is how you date. 

I told him that there was nothing to talk about and I didn't want to speak to him again. I can never bring myself to send the classic ""you're an asshole. You wasted my time. You lead me on,"" etc etc texts because it's not my style and it's not like it will resonate. The crazy part is that I have been out with other guys since I met him. I ended up not connecting with anyone like I did with him, but I still put myself out there because it's too early to know for sure about anyone in 1 month. That's why I said I wanted to get to know each other to figure out if it could be something. 

What the fuck.

444,fwfwyy,False,Question,90,Is dating sex?,dating,"Throughout my entire life looked for something special in a relationship. The romantic film kind of relationship. But the more I got older the more I realized that most people don't care about trying to find someone special. Most people care about trying to satisfy them for awhile. And to some people, they may even call that dating. Which doesn't make since to me because dating to me is making a choice to be with someone you value in your life but in my dating experience and seeing the some of my exes evolved over time. It seems like people just see dating as sex know. And I still can't comprehend how someone can see dating as just sex...",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/fwfwyy/is_dating_sex/,378,"I have a theory on this. It's the idea that as we gain experience, we have more examples to reference for how things actually are.

Unfortunately this impacts the older of us more than the younger. You have to consider that by the time you're in your 30's, lots of very stable, emotionally available people who want committed marriages and who hold enough stability to make said marriages last tend to already have found one another. So what's left is in no small part individuals who have suffered bad breakups, cheating, their own promiscuity, or some other bad choices that helped contribute to relationship woes. Then you spend a lot of your time filtering through all of the damaged people to find the one or two who are of high quality who just happened to come out of a bad situation at little to no fault of their own.

But then you have to ask yourself that with so few of those people to choose from, why would they choose us when they have such a wide pool for selecting?

And the bottom line is that humans pair-bond to mate. Note that most animals can walk 24 hours after birth, and many are fully-functional within the first year. Humans take 18 years before they can function fully in the world. This is because our brains are so large compared to the rest of our bodies and as such, females had to evolve large enough hips to carry and birth our young. Because of that, female humans couldn't run from predators if their hips were much larger, which wasn't really an option for evolution. So what happened instead is we evolved to give birth very prematurely, well before most of the development would have been finished, which is why infants are so utterly helpless that they would immediately die if not continuously cared for.

Because of this, we evolved to pair-bond with our mates for the sake of caring for human infants. It's just a requirement. We know that we can inspire pair-bonding in animals through the use of particular levels of neurological chemicals such as I believe, serotonin.

Basically, while I don't want to downplay the idea of love or make anyone upset, the bottom line does appear to be that love is a construct of emotions crafted by nature so that we pair-bond to have sex and then care for our young. Men are biologically engineered to seek out multiple females for reproduction so as to best present the opportunity for our genes to manifest, but because females are the sexual selectors in most animals, including humans, many males end up not selected at all, while all females tend to have mating opportunities.

In fact, you have twice as many female ancestors as male. This is evidence of this and couldn't be this way unless almost all women mated and many men did not. This literally means that some men are mating disproportionately to other men, and some men aren't mating at all because they aren't being selected by women. You know women do the sexual selecting because if men did, all men would be mating, and they aren't.

So that is my theory, coupled with some of the facts of mate-selection. ",2020-04-07 07:04:35

447,f9r3p5,False,I Need Advice,111,"1,5 years ago I posted here about an amazing date. Now, I am completely (heart)broken from the break-up with the same girl... I am lost and don't know what to do.",dating,"Since this is a subreddit for dating and my issue is about a break-up, I am not sure if this post is allowed here... However, I think I really need some advice on how to deal with things, since I am completely lost right now. Sorry if it is a bit of a story, but I really feel the need to write this off me.

Around 1,5 years ago, I created post here about how I've met this girl during my roadtrip through the US, after the roadtrip she came over to visit me once again (she lives in another country), and I really started to like her. After this post, we visited each other multiple times, both fell in love and ended up in a relationship. It was great. While it wasn't my first relationship, it surely was different then the ones I've had before: everything felt much more intense: my feelings for her, my happiness every time I saw her, texted her or called her, everything. While normally I wouldn't think a long-distance relationship would be something I'd be interested in (my last relationship before that ended because of the distance), this time it wasn't a problem at all. Everything felt great and for me, it felt like we belonged together.

But ofcourse, no relationship is perfect. Sometimes our personalities collided: while I often say/do things out of emotion, she often did/say things from a more rational point of view and had a hard time showing her emotions to anyone. This resulted in us sometimes not understand each other why the other one did/say something and could cause a discussion. But despite all of this, I was still happy to be with her in the long run. We both worked hard for this relationship.

Last January, the first big issue came. I was at her place and we had a pretty big fight in the morning, which resulted in a break-up. However, I stayed there the rest of the day because I didn't want to leave yet and she didn't want me to leave yet... The evening came and I had to head home (had to drive for 6 hours to get home). Saying goodbye at that moment was horrible. We spend around 30 minutes sitting in my car crying in each others arms, before I eventually drove of. The drive was horrible. I was constantly in tears, couldn't focus on the road so had to stop every time, and even had to vomit a few times. So I texted her how I felt and the situation I was in... and she called me. She was in tears as well, saying we might have made a big mistake. Now, many people are not a big fan of restarting a relationship after a break-up for multiple reasons, but it was obvious here that we both still loved each other and couldn't let each other go yet... We didn't want to pretend nothing happened, so we decided instead of heading fully into a relationship again, we would 'lable' ourselves as 'back to dating' to take some of the pressure off. A week ago I flew to her place once again, and we had an amazing time! No discussions, no fights, everything seemed great.

But then, one week later, she called me. She said she has thought about us and everything a lot, and she said her feelings concerning 'being in love with me' have faded away and she sees me more as a friend. That call broke me. Personally I thought we were heading in the right direction again, but I guess I was wrong. I can't help but blame myself.

Due to the distance, she has send me a letter explaining her feelings. When this letter arrives (it hasn't yet), we will make one final phone call, to give both of us the opportunity to ask questions and make sure no things are being left open. Then, we will break contact for a while. We both don't want to lose each other out of our lives, because we still care too much about each other. We want to continue as friends, but both know that is only possible when I am completely over her and have learned to love her as a friend instead... But thinking about not having contact with her after that call is hard. These last few days were horrible. I can't focus on my work or study (I am a student pilot, so I had to cancel all my flights for this week due to a lack of focus), I start crying in the most random moments... I am a mess. I don't want to sound pathatic, but my heart is broken and I don't know how to get over this... I have the feeling I have lost my soulmate and love of my life, and I can't stop blaming myself that it now is over...

So yea I think that's enough dating for me for the year.

**Edit**:  Had a few people ask what the argument was, so I've copied my other comment.

I had mentioned how a few people have told me I kinda looked like Obama. She got unreasonably angry and said how much she hated him. Her reaction threw me off so I decided to steer the conversation away from politics. She was too riled up by that point and said I ""have a lot to learn"" and ""don't know anything about life"". 

She's a bit older than me and this was the third time she had said something like that to me. I had already told her once already that it's extraordinarily rude to say shit like that to someone. So I said it again, only this time I added ""I don't have to take this from you, or anyone for that matter"". 

Then I put my jacket on and was halfway out the door and WHAM. 

I'm not a doctor or anything but I don't see how anything I said warrants that kind of behavior.

I think her anger might not have been so much about politics, she might just hate Obama because her ex husband also kinda looks like him too.

457,ec7e39,False,Other,34,I feel like I’m actually doing this right for once,dating,"I’m (20m) having my third date with this lovely gal(21F) on Friday. We’re going bowling! We’ve been going at this slow pace that I’ve never gone before, and I haven’t had anything like it. My last actual girlfriend was unable to go on dates because her family was controlling and didn’t know about me. Her mom tracked her phone, watched her like a hawk. So we only saw each other at school. Her mom questioned her when she saw me at my McDonald’s job for 5 minutes. Another girlfriend I had after her only lasted 3 weeks and we only had one date and then saw each other and fucked 2-3 or more times a day. That was nice, besides her emotional instability. That was when I was living in Orange County. Here, in my small hometown, I figured I wouldn’t meet anyone because there was no one to meet. I was wrong.

I met her when I saw her in the building I’m always in at the college, which is the theater building (I’m a music major). She was panicking looking for her wallet and I helped her look. I did some circuits around the inside of the building and she went to the student center to the lost and found. I kept looking and I made a circle around the building. She came back a while later and I was still looking. I stopped for a minute to practice piano but something just pulled me into looking. I couldn’t just stop. No way. So I saw her in the theater again and she was kind of amazed that I was still looking. We exchanged names and went on our way. Next time I saw her she was working at the local grocery store and she shook my hand, said she actually found her wallet. I told her she could find me at the theater building Mondays and Wednesday’s. We saw each other again soon after that and basically said we should hang out but we didn’t exchange contact info. Next time we saw each other was the 50th anniversary concert at the college and I performed with the vocal jazz group and she sung with the chamber choir. She gave me her number but I think it was a texting app. She never responded. I don’t think I saw her for another 3 weeks and I almost completely forgot about her. I was going to sleep on one of the couches in the theater building  and she got my attention and we added each other on Facebook and that’s when I asked her on a date.

This slow pace that we’re going feels like it’s going lightning speed. That’s because it feels natural, and she’s actually interested in me as a person. For the first date we got coffee. That was really nice but super nerve wracking. I ordered a mint tea with honey and lemon because my voice was shot and I had a performance that night (I was supposed to be on vocal rest but I made an exception). When we first sat down I froze up. I kept opening my mouth but no words came out. I visibly expressed some level of frustration and then I excused myself to the bathroom, splashed some cold water on my face and came back. It was all good after that, but I think my nervousness made her nervous too. We ended up talking for 2 hours and played chess (we didn’t finish though). And I think the staff was lowkey stalking us because they thought the date was cute. When we parted I thought about kissing her, but I didn’t and we only hugged. Overall it went well. Her eyes were quite dilated I noticed and I’m sure mine were too.

Next date we went to a nice restaurant and saw Tom Hanks A Beautiful Day in the neighborhood (I HIGHLY recommend the movie, especially on a date!). When we were at the restaurant I sort of confessed my crush on her by casually slipping in “the crush is real” in another context but implying the double meaning. She did tell me that this was the nicest date she’s ever been on. We were planning on seeing frozen 2 but it was showing too late. When we saw the movie it was top 10 one of the most emotional movies I ever saw. I cried and she definitely noticed. But I had my arm around her the entire time, and when it got to the part in the movie where the journalist was asking Mr Roger’s wife what it was like to be married to a living saint, and her response being that she doesn’t like that word because it implies that that way of being is unattainable. I said “what a beautiful way to be” I looked at her and we kissed. A lot. I put my other arm around her and she held my hand. When it was over I told her about an emotional self growth/self love moment I had. I drove her home and she made me absolutely melt because I walked her to her door and we kissed, talked some, I looked to my left and she moved forward to kiss me on the cheek. Something about that made my knees weak. Before she went in, she came back out and said “one more” and kissed me again.

Melted.

What a beautiful experience. It was genuine, it was a lovely connection, and I could argue that it was a spiritual experience. I felt 100% myself the entire date. I have Asperger’s syndrome and I told her that the first date. She said her brother has it too. That’s an important detail because I spent until I was 16 or 17 with a forever alone mentality, until I had my first real girlfriend that was a toxic relationship, and kinda grew as a person and my self concept changed so radically that I feel like a completely different person. Only recently have I actually considered myself to not be severely socially inhibited.

We’re having our third at the bowling alley and I might take her to a thrift store nearby and the ice cream parlor at the merc if it’s still open. Super excited about that, and she’s looking forward to it too. She’s lovely guys. I’ve got a good one potentially.

458,e71xdh,False,Giving Advice,76,9 SImple Datings Tips for Introverts,dating,"First dates are stressful enough; but when you are an introvert, they can be panic-inducing. You already don’t do well with meeting new people, but meeting someone you know will be “sizing you up” is definitely shallow breathing time. So, as you think about the upcoming event, you start re-living all of the past disastrous first dates you have had—your short, curt responses to questions asked, your inability to keep a flow of conversation going, those awkward “good nights.” And the shallow breaths are now accompanied by that grinding in the pit of your stomach.

While no magic wand can take your introversion away, there are some things you can do to master the art of the first date.

The Preparation  
1. No Drastic Changes  
Should you decide that you want some new shoes or even a new outfit for your date, go for it. But don’t make big changes. Don’t buy a pair of shoes or an outfit that isn’t “you.” And don’t get a brand new haircut.

Here’s the thing about such changes: You will spend the date being very self-conscious because you are not comfortable with such a change. You haven’t had your own time to get used to it, and now here you are on a date. Yikes. The goal is to increase your comfort level, and dressing as you always do will help that.

2. Pick a Dating Event That’s Short  
Meeting for a drink or coffee or attending some short event is usually the best for an introvert. There is comfort in knowing that it will be short up front, and you will have far less dread or stress. And, if thing goes well, that short chunk of time can always be extended into dinner or something else.

It’s much easier to approach the date this way than to plan a long evening, then try to cut it short. Actually, this is good advice for all first dates with strangers, so don’t feel that you are somehow different.

3. Choose a Place or Event You Know  
Going someplace new can add to your discomfort—you won’t know your way around and you’ll be distracted trying to familiarize yourself with the place. If this is the short first date, choose a coffee shop, simple restaurant, or a small bar you already know. You will be familiar with the table arrangements, the location and parking, the menu, and the people who will be waiting on you. All of these things will let you focus on the person you are with.

4. Pick an Activity You Enjoy  
If sitting across from a stranger and making conversation is awkward for you, why not choose a date in which you will be actively doing something? Weather permitting, you could go to the zoo or botanical garden; you could go to a wine or food tasting event or a street fest; how about a bar that has air hockey if you’re good at it? Being involved in an activity gives you more to talk about, and it allows you to “be you.”

5. Practice a Bit  
When job candidates go for interviews, they often practice answering the likely questions with a friend. A first date is a bit like an interview, let’s face it. Get a friend to sit down with you and ask you some likely questions. Practice both your verbal and non-verbal responses, including facial expressions and other gestures until they seem natural. Then, turn the tables. You come up with questions to ask your date, then practice being an active good listener as well.

The Date  
6. Ask Open-Ended Questions  
If you have practiced with that friend, you have questions to which there are longer answers than just “yes” or “no.” Ask them, and practice those listening skills with eye contact, head nods, and small smiles (and laughs if they are genuinely funny). You want that individual to know you have a genuine interest in others and in him/her specifically. Plus, how else do you get to know someone if you don’t ask questions that allow them to open up and show you who they are?

Instead of asking them what they do for a living, ask them what they like best and least about their job. Just don’t keep firing those questions out of nervousness. You won’t your date to feel like it is an interrogation. And if you have practiced the likely questions you will be asked, you will know what to share or not. Oversharing on a first date can be a bit awkward for the other person. Giving all of the details of your last breakup is oversharing—save it.

7. You Don’t Need to Hide Your Introversion  
You may be able to “fake” an outgoingness for a short period of time—especially if you have practiced this before—but you are really only doing that to make what you think will be a good first impression. If this first date turns into a second one, however, and s/he wants to take you to a large social event, your secret will be out. You don’t have to blurt out that you are an introvert, but as you talk about your interests and hobbies, it is likely that that aspect of your personality will come out.

8. Plan Your “Escape” in Advance  
If you’re seeing all sort of red flags, take note. Here are just a couple:

Your date’s talk is all negative about other people—last relationship, boss, co-workers, etc. This is not a good sign.  
Your date treats a waiter or waitress badly and/or loses his/her temper when something isn’t cooked just right—this isn’t a kind person.  
Your date is a narcissist and can only talk about him/herself, never asking you a question.  
An extrovert in this situation might very well be a bit confrontational and announce that the date is over. Introverts tend to bite their tongues and endure the pain for the duration. You don’t have to do this. Set up your excuses ahead of time. Have a friend text you about an hour in and have a signal to text back. Then the phone call can come that presents a situation that requires your immediate attention. Or start feeling poorly and go to the restroom. When you return, explain that you are ill and really need to go.

A fake excuse, mind you, should be used as a last resort; if and whenever possible, it’s best to be honest about things. You can bow out of the date with a simple “I’m sorry to do this, I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed with things and would prefer to go home.” In preparation for this moment, it’s a good idea to drive separately to your date, as well. No need for an awkward car ride home.

And Afterward  
9. Don’t Ruminate  
Introverts have amazing memories—detailed memories—because they take everything in. This is both a blessing and a curse. At work, it is often a blessing because introverts observe and listen before drawing conclusions and often come up with good creative solutions.

After a date, it can be a curse. Introverts tend to re-live every single moment, kicking themselves because they said something stupid or because their awkwardness/anxiety was showing. Give yourself a break. You are exaggerating and focusing on your perceived “bad” rather than on the many good things that probably happened. Focus on the positives of the date and what went well instead. This gives you confidence for a second date or to move onto someone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/e71xdh/9_simple_datings_tips_for_introverts/,365,Go dutch.

Every time I’ve felt things are not working out and I might end up looking for sex/attention elsewhere I break things up before I even meet someone. Maybe that’s why I am single at 35  but it’s better than cheating.

Just found out yesterday the woman I’ve been seeing “exclusive” for six months and whom I’ve been to trips and already had a lot of memories has always been with someone else all this time.

You never get too old to feel disheartened and disappointed and it is really hard to not blame yourself and get a hit on your self esteem.

I wonder why it is so hard just to say they want sex with someone else or just accept we are just a hook up. Self centrism and selfishness that’s what it is. 

I am hopeful I’ll find someone. It’s never too late.

460,cfy8g6,False,None,90,My parents never taught me anything about dating. The Internet helped me learn in two months what they could have in years.,dating,"Coming from a conservative Christian family, my parents never taught me about dating. They just told me stuff like :

""Boys are of the devil."" (So stupid because I have a little brother)

""Go to school, graduate, find a job, get married."" (Like it's that easy?!)

I really love my parents, I do, but I hated it that they didn't teach me ACTUAL and PRACTICAL skills on how this is done and I kind of blame them for my failures.

That's why I'm so thankful I found Reddit. Two months ago I was this naive, vulnerable immature woman when it comes to dating.

But after learning after several dates and a break up, I learned a lot.

I also learned soooo much about dating from YouTube and from Reddit and I'm soooo grateful for it.

Truly, this is a learned and applied skill and whatever success we accomplish is the result of hard work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cfy8g6/my_parents_never_taught_me_anything_about_dating/,365,"They are right though. It will definitely not be easy, but worth it. Don't you want love? You will NEVER find it sleeping around. NEVER. That's sex. You are believing the lies the little boys tell you. If you aren't a TRUE believer in Jesus Christ, you believe lies. What happens is parents teach their kids to not tell people the TRUTH. To be ""nice"" to people. This is why Jesus says you have to be reborn. 

 

# John 3:3 King James Version (KJV)

**3** Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

&#x200B;

It's so you can tell the TRUTH again. So you can believe in TRUTH again. Once you learn to lie as a human being your brain believes lies too. That's the TRUTH. Think of it as science if you want. It's just what happens to our brains. Your brain is negatively charged when you lie. It believes lies, it tells lies. This is why you become depressed. Depression is negative thought. When your brain is positively charged it believes TRUTH, it tells the TRUTH. That's how you become happy. By telling yourself and others the TRUTH. Jesus is the cornerstone for TRUTH. 

 

# Matthew 21:42

“Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?” 

&#x200B;

This is why they killed Him. He spoke TRUTH. It wasn't just that He was saying He was the Son of God, it was the fact that He was offending people by telling them the TRUTH. Imagine Him telling someone they were fat. He would tell someone the TRUTH to help them. He wouldn't be doing it to be mean, but that's how they would take it. They thought He was just mean. Look at my post history and see how much people downvote me. They hate what I am saying because I am telling TRUTH. I know what love is though. They don't. They date to have sex. They will lie to you just to have sex with you. You are going to find this out when you realize they keep lying to you. You are going to believe their lies until you see the lies for yourself come TRUE. Then you are going to keep wondering why they keep lying to you. It's because you believe lies. You more than likely aren't going to believe what I am saying because I am speaking TRUTH, and you quit believing in TRUTH. You will NEVER find love though if you don't believe in TRUTH. 

&#x200B;

Don't make yourself more depressed by sleeping with a bunch of guys. You will regret it. Jesus is real, so not believing in Him makes you depressed because it makes you delusional to not believe in Him. ",2019-07-21 11:55:27

462,c88tz3,False,Venting,68,"I'm absolutely gutted, from 100 to 0 in a instant.",dating,"So, I really haven't been that interested in dating anyone for a very long time, for at least 5 years. Sure I've met people that I liked but never really clicked, or they have other issues which stop me from wanting to be with them. I haven't really been looking... But I haven't been turning people away either.

4 months ago, I met someone who I thought was freaking amazing.  Very pretty, smart, funny, similar personalities, similar interests. She was absolutely stunning. She wasn't perfect, but initially we got on like a house on fire. Honestly It's been so long since I've felt a genuine connection with a female. I'm typically pretty awkward, but things just seemed really natural and easy going between us. We seemed extremely well matched.Issue was, that this was a camping trip and she had come from another part of the country. So we only saw each other for a few days before separating. For the last four months, we have been talking every day, and calling weekly. Things seemed really healthy, and I was becoming optimistic that I had finally found someone.

But things between us slowed down in the last few weeks. Largely because of me having a rough time with life in general.

* My sister tried to commit suicide, I saved her life after she overdosed.
* My dad has been extremely low with depression.
* My friendships have been suffering, due to me finding out about one of my good mates cheating in his relationship.
* My granddad is very ill, and likely wont leave hospital again.
* One of my mates died in a car crash.
* I lost my job (redundancy). And have been struggling financially.
* I failed study because of the above.
* I have felt really low, and depressed. Feeling like I don't have much support.

I let her know what was happening, and she didn't seem that worried at all. Although I wasn't reaching out to her as much as normal during this time, she would always respond straight away. She said she understood, and was really caring and supporting of the situation. So I planned a trip to go visit her and my brother, after things settled down. At this point we were not in a relationship, but were still really close. My plan was to see how things went, and perhaps consider asking her out if things went well (I knew for sure she liked me).Keeping in mind, I have family where she lives, and was graduating soon. The job market in her part of the country is ideal for what I'm studying... So moving to be closer to her and my family was defiantly an option. Any relationship with her wont have been long distance for long at all.

I booked flights, and she was really excited. All systems were go.... Until today. She messaged me, saying that she probably couldn't make it to our date, since she had to work instead.... I was really confused, since we had been talking about this for awhile, and she had told me she had taken the time off work.I then saw something on one of her mates snap chat, which to me looked like she was with someone else at a party.So I asked her whether she was seeing someone else. Her response, ""Yea, sort of... We have been staying at each others house, and seeing a lot of each other. But we are not really dating"". She then goes on to say how he is her ex, and they were together for 3 years a couple of years ago, and how they have caught up, and things are starting to pick up again.

I then asked weather I could have done anything differently, and weather things would have worked out if we were in the same city. Her response was that yes, she probably would have dated me if we were in the same city, and that she did like me.

So well, fuck. There's my weekend plans ruined. At least I have family up there, so my plans now are just to catch up with my brother, and help him work on his project car.Just feels like a really shitty ending, to a really shitty point in my life... So I've got a plane to catch in a couple of days, to go spend some time with my brother. Which is fine.... I was just really looking forward to seeing this girl. It's been so long since I've actually developed feelings for someone, and now I'm crushed.

464,dkgtth,False,Venting,62,"Thanks to this sub, I finally learned to take the high road and be honest….",dating,"45/F here.  In the past year I haven’t had any action in the dating scene other than a couple bad & brief first dates.  Lately I’ve been feeling like it’s time to “scratch that itch,” as they say, so I turned to Tinder for help.  It’s not something I normally do, but what can I say; sometimes a girl has needs. And Tinder delivered!  Got matched with a very good-looking guy, my age, no red flags in his profile or our texts.  We decide pretty quickly to meet up soon, rather than text endlessly.  

&#x200B;

So we meet up tonight for a drink at a bar near my place.  He looks like his photos and is very sweet, there's instant chemistry, the conversation is flowing.  Before long we’re making out.  I bring him home to my place and things get hot and heavy. For a little while, I’m a happy girl.  But then…

&#x200B;

In the middle of us having sex, he says – and may I just stress here that this is our first date – “I love you so much.”  I don’t reply, and he says it again.  

&#x200B;

Me: “You do know this is our first date, right?”

Him: “I know, but come on, say it back.  It’s just words, it would be so hot to hear you say it back.”

Me:  “Nope.  Not saying it.”

Him:  “But it’s just words.”

Me, shaking my head vigorously as my desire begins evaporating: “NOPE.  I’m not saying that.”

&#x200B;

Suddenly things aren’t so fun anymore.  I’ve been with this type before – the love bomber, or whatever they’re called.  He’s also saying things like “You’re just what I was looking for,” and “I’m so glad we met, I really want a girlfriend again” etc. etc.  Alarms are going off in my head and I’m having instant PTSD from all the previous similar guys I’ve met.  They flood you with affection and say all the things they think you want to hear on the first date, and before you know it, you’re being stalked or emotionally abused or they want to move in together after two weeks.

&#x200B;

NOPE NOPE NOPE.  Bye bye desire.  But he’s still in my damn bed, saying he wants to ""do me all night.""  So I say I need to go to the bathroom, and I leave the room to go sit on my couch. 

&#x200B;

Even though I already know what I need to do, I log on to r/dating for a boost of confidence.  I read similar posts about all of your frustrations, and your awesome advice to each other.  I know I need to tell him this isn’t going to work. 

&#x200B;

After a while he comes into the living room, confused as to why I left the bed.  At first I say, “oh I’m just catching up on my work emails.”  He tries to kiss me and I resist.  He says, “So… do you want me to leave?”  

&#x200B;

I take a deep breath and explain that I think we’re looking for different things, I was only looking for a night of fun, but not anything more serious than that.  He takes it very well and says “oh okay that’s cool, I’ll get dressed and leave.”  And he does.  He says while walking out, “Hey let me know if you ever want more fun.”  I say I will, but I won’t.

&#x200B;

So I did it.  Instead of lying there all night, watching the clock, agonizing over what the morning will be like, what to do next, feeling bad about not liking him when he likes me (yep that was the old me) etc. etc... I just bit the bullet and was honest.  And it feels good.  

&#x200B;

So, thank you Reddit.  It took me a long time to gather up this kind of courage, but it sure feels good to be up front and express how I feel to a guy.  And to not lead them on, for fear of hurting them.  I know now that it’s ultimately more hurtful to disillusion them.  Or ghost them.  

&#x200B;

Sleep well, everyone!  I know I will.  

&#x200B;

Yeah, as a single man I've let myself be swept into feelings of frustration and anger over women's ""impossibly high standards"" and the supposed disadvantage a male has in the dating world. I don't know why, but it's tempting to feel like a victim, like the world is unfair, to become angry and frustrated over it.

I gave it some genuine thought and came to these conclusions:

&#x200B;

***1***: I have some pretty high standards myself. Age (-7 or +5 compared to my own), location (at 40-50mi I'm starting to think ""that's way too far""), education (college-level+), job (must be able to contribute to a household and must be passionate about their job), looks (not expecting a supermodel, but must be reasonably fit, reasonably groomed & decent style, must speak to me on a sexual level,... luckily I don't have narrow tastes).

And that's just the basics, then there's common life goals and values, personalities that mesh well together, some similar interests + areas of being complementary,... Yikes, just typing it out I realize just how high my standards are... It's not just women, I suppose.

&#x200B;

***2***: I used to focus on the happy couples, the guys and gals who seemed to have no problem whatsoever getting dates, hookups and ltr's. But I realized that not everyone is constantly hookup up, or building a future with their high school sweetheart. I was blind to all the people I know – male and female – who have been single for a long time, never got into a relationship etc. And they're quite diverse... They're not all stereotypical ""weird uncles"".

Many were too busy with their careers or other interests, never thought that love and relationships were all they're cracked up to be. However, I do acknowledge that the population of 'forever alone' people has many people somewhat lacking in the looks and/or dating/social skills departments.

I was a late bloomer in many regards, but I've had several girlfriends and ltr's. Many of which started on the woman's initiative. I'm thankful for the experiences I've had in those relationships, and the lessons I've learned. Many of the eternal singles I know never had such opportunities – and I now humbly admit I could've been one of them, if it weren't for those opportunities.

&#x200B;

So in summary: to the ladies, my apologies for having been so quick to play the victim card – I don't have it as bad as I thought. And to myself: a regular dose of perspective can go a long way to prevent bitterness and cynicism.

Well now I have something going on with someone, and while I really like this, I look back to the time I was single and realize it wasn't that bad. Clearly if someone likes me now, then all of those doubts I had were untrue, I just couldnt see it at the time.

You learn just as much from being single as you do when you're in a relationship.

478,9ucv89,False,Giving Advice,107,"You will always be able to tell if someone is into you by appling the "" two knock method""",dating,"
After being in sales, you'll  realize that sales is alot like the dating world.  In the end you're selling a product. If someone  is interested they will bite. If not  they'll  move on.

Either or you have to be in charge of you and realize the genius of you.

Just like sales I knocked from door to door which was ""b2b"". Grant it the job was shit, but I learned a valuable lesson. This lesson was when to move on and learn ehen someone  isn't interested.

So here comes the two knock method.

Two knocks just means two tries you give to the person to show their interests  in you. After two tries you feel and hear or see nothing you move on.

If on fb you add a girl and you don't  feel anything at first or she's  short give it a second chance. Odds are we're  human. Maybe she was busy or maybe she had somewhere to go. Nevertheless, within that first knock you feel around and gather atmosphere and how she responds to you. If it feels flat then she could be i to someone else and not you.

Second knock is most likely dealing with  hanging out. If she mentions she going somewhere and you wish to come along say hi or something  and she never gives a time its because shes not interested. You only need to ask one two times to hang out or date.  That is the maximum. If she doesnt dm you or text you a time she's  not into you. She's  dropping hints  that she'll  wish to go where she goes and she doesn't  want you around.

Take that hint. Ask her no more. Seek her no more. Contact her no more. If she shows interest from now on it's  her responsibility to find you. She most likely wont because just like in sales the customer will either bite what youre giving or slam the door in your face. 

Two knocks is all you give. When the door opens it will be effortless if not theyre not into what you're  selling. When you internalize that you'll  never have an issue with someone wasting your time because  they'll  never be able to.

480,d969sc,False,Tinder/Online Dating,169,Tinder and Bumble for a week. A Meta-analysis.,dating,"**Introduction:** Hello everyone, i'm Alex and i've been visiting this sub-reddit for a year now, i always saw a lot of posts about OLD and how unfair and uneffective it was, especially for the boys. OLD is slowly becoming the standard way in which a guy and a girl meet for a relationship, let's face it, almost everyone has Tinder. So i decided to try myself to take  some results out of it and share with everyone to have a nice discussion about it. Also that's my first post and english is not my main language, if something comes out bad i will modify it as soon as possible, you can also correct me please.

**Background:** I'm a 25 years old guy born in Romania and raised in Rome currently living in Frankfurt,Germany and i don't speak german yet,i study nursing sciences and work in the construction field to pay my course, i don't have anything particular or exciting, i'm not a fancy hipster who loves art and likes to travel and taking photos, i'm not muscular and i don't always have positive vibes going on (wtf). In short, i'm a normal guy with no particular ability just a big interest in social dynamics and the evolution of modern interactions between people.

**Purpose:** To open a big discussion on the effectiveness of the OLD and the cons that comes with it. Also i made a list ofthe main topics:

1. Which app is the most succesfull.
2. What kind of conversations come up during the interactions.
3. Do looks matter? Or is the interaction more valuable?
4. Ghosting percentile.

I need some participation to answer those topics so feel free to share your numbers and experiences.

Also that's not a meta-analysis but that word looks too great in the title to pass on it!

**7 days on Tinder and Bumble:** So i downloaded both apps on 19th of september and set up the profiles with these photos and without any description (added my height because that's one of my strong points).

**Tinder results:** 29 matches

1 girl texted me

3 girls got a text from me

2 girls answered

0 dates set up

**Bumble results:** 14 matches

10 girls texted me

0 dates set up

I should say that all the girls i've talked to ghosted me at one point or the conversation died. There are only 2 left which i'm still talking to and i feel like they will stop texting very soon.

**Conversation examples:**     1.   [https://imgur.com/7twVMcH](https://imgur.com/7twVMcH)

5. [https://imgur.com/bPpp3Ki](https://imgur.com/bPpp3Ki)

**Conclusions:** I have to be honest with you, i couldn't wait for this to be over, it was nice during the first swipes getting a lot of matches, later on the days passed and every conversation i had was not stimulating, poor, boring and most importantly it never came to a conclusion, of a date or a hang out.

I also was very frustrated when they stopped answering out of nowhere and for no reason, to me it felt like these apps are used just like instagram, to show off the appearence and nothing more. Many girls have their instagram on their description (always swiped left on those) and the majority of them are so clichè with the traveling, photography, art, positive vibes, fitness related stuff and so on. I've found no one interesting.

One thing i noticed is that even if i didn't enjoy the swaping thing i would always be attracted towards it, i've found myself continuously  reaching for the phone to swipe and check the girls, i find it very detrimental.

To close this topic out i'd like to say that i don't feel like these apps are made for genuine people with genuine purpouses (sex or relationship), it's more about showing off and texting with someone when bored. I don't feel like if you don't match with some girls or if someone ghosts you or doesn't answer you back means that you have something wrong or that you're not good looking or your eloquence is bad. But those are just my opinions, let me know yours and i hope you liked it, if this discussion has some success i will do a 20 or 30 days osservation. You can test it yourself and make your own post, let's be creative!

482,ffrx1j,False,Other,37,reconnected with a girl i met 4+ years ago,dating,"It all started in 2015 when i (m25 then, 29 now) first met her (w21 then, 25 now)  via mutual friends. We both were single at the time. She never had a bf before and zero experience at all, on the other side i already had 2 pretty shitty short term flicks. We started to hang out more often and eventually i had a feeling that this could work out, so i did send that risky text, asking her about what she feels. I'm a pretty shy and introverted person so this was anything but easy for me and the reason i did it via text and not in person. She turned me down, not because she didn't like me but because she  felt more like being just friends would feel better to her. Back then i thought ""fuck yeah, i got friendzoned"" and sadly did not invest that much effort into the friendship anymore. I always told myself it was to get over my feeling to her, but in the end it was kind of a dick and selfish move.

Some months passed and i eventually met my now ex gf of the next 4 years. In all that time i maybe had a handful conversations with her, mainly on birthdays and new years etc. It still felt like there was some kind of connection even when we havent seen in all those years and barely talked. I actually was interrested in keeping closer contact and build up on that friendship now that i'm not single anymore and feelings probably couldn't hurt me. But my gf at the time was a really jealous person and did not want me to have contact or a friendship with a girl i used to have feelings for. So we never met in those 4 years, when it actually could have been so easy since she studied in the same town as i was living in for the past 2 years.

2020 rolls in, i'm a fresh single again and actually pretty happy with that. At first i didn't thought about her but she recently started being quite active on social media (she is a cosplayer) and it got my attention. I asked her to met up and she was in for it without any hesitation. It took us almost 2 months to finally set up a day but in the end we got there. Since then we have met more than once, just the two of us and sometimes with mutual friends and this past weekend she slept at my place because we were out with friends and she couldn't catch her train in time. ""Nothing"" happend, we just talked for hours straight (you know that drunken trashtalk you do) until it was already early in the morning and we totally messed up out sleepcycle by only getting 2 hours of sleep in the end.

I had to get up at noon for a football (soccer) game and told her she could stay in my appartment as long as she wants to. As soon as i left for my game i felt like i probably missed a chance there and couldn't help it but text her about how good it felt to reconnect with her and that i haven't been that happy in a long time. I once again send that risky text asking her about what she feels and if she still thinks of me as ""just a friend"". Even if she did, i would have been fine with it now, i learned so much in these years that i wouldn't have called it ""friendzoned again"". To my surprise she answered almost instantly and hell this fact and the actual response cheered me up like nothing did in a very long time.

She is in for the ""let's see where this is going and if it works out, why not"". Later we talked about the sleepover and what would have happend if i made a move that night. She said she probably would have gone with it, but she is very happy i didn't since we both were still a bit drunk and that i showed a lot of respect for her to not take advantage of that. She thinks it was way better to talk about it before and if i haven't send that risky text, she would have done it later that day.

Now here i am, looking forward to dating a wonderful woman and so excited for what is about to happen in the next days, weeks, months or even years. :)

She was this giant pretty cute 6'1"" tennis player who could most def crush mere average built 5'9"" boy like myself. We vibed (so I thought) from DMing each other so I asked her out on a dinner date at a Japanese restaurant. When I saw her in real life, she was just as expected; tall. We had a really friendly dinner but there was an issue with the order. She ordered beef teriyaki dinner plate but instead they brought out chicken teriyaki. When it arrived, by her looks, the waiter immediately recognized the mishap so he promised he'll bring the correct order and left the chicken teriyaki since the wait time was long. Without hesitation she started digging into the chicken teriyaki and by the time the beef teriyaki came out, she was already finished with it. She then started inhaling the beef teriyaki like Kirby swallowing all the innocent waddle dees while I was half way done with my dinner plate (guess I was doing most of the talking since she was too busy focusing on eating but damn that was a spectacle). When she finished her second plate, she looked at me straight in the eyes and let out like the loudest burp I've ever heard. Then in a cutesy way she was like ""Oops I ate too fast"" and sat back rubbing her full stomach. In my mind I was like ""What... the... fuck"". If this was all recorded in like a video, you probably can see my hair get blown back due to the sheer force of that expelled gas oof.

I could've nudged her to ditch them just for one night since I wanted to get to know her more but I obliged. After dropping her off, I texted her that I'm down to hangout again but never got any response thereafter.

TLDR; A girl I took on a date ate 2 whole dinner plates and burped at me, to which she later ghosted me after I paid for her dinner bill.

Edit: Thank you all for the recommendation. I'll def focus more on taking my date out for coffee or something relatively cheap but worthy activity.

486,ctzugi,False,Venting,84,"[Venting] Today is day 1 for me. I just got back from the gym, and I'm a bit of an emotional mess.",dating,"Today is day 1 for me. I've been going to the gym for 3 years, and today after a long time, my past kicked me in the balls all over again. I left the gym wanting to cry.

Growing up, I was the shortest dude in my class, and I'm still short compared to people around me. I was one of the few Indian kids. I also wasn't very strong. I used to get singled out by the gym teachers in high school to compete with girls, was never allowed to compete with guys on sports events (btw, I don't think women are weaker than men, or that there is anything wrong with having to compete with women, because hey, I'd love to be as badass as so many women I know). I used to get bullied in so many ways.

""Your mother must be scared to look at you"" ""Why are you so pidgeon chested"" ""Don't worry man, you'll find someone""

I used to get valentine's day cards saying ""I like the smell of your armpits"". I didn't have any BO, but people wanted to see me excited, and then watch my face drop.

The girls who asked me to dance at school parties did it because of a dare, and only wanted to make fun of me.

Guys used to push me into girls, and then everyone would call me a creep. As an Indian guy, I'm already very sensitive to girls not feeling safe around me (yes, we have a terrible reputation, and we collectively need to get better). I hated it. I hated being the reason for other people not feeling comfortable.

So I made myself really smart. I got really creative and artistic. I became a student leader. I made myself weirdly popular, respectable, and untouchable just so all of the bullshit would stop. I never got strong, not for lack of trying. I never attracted or genuinely excited anyone.

At the end of college, I experienced heartbreak because the girl I fell in love with after 3 years of knowing her didn't feel the same way about me, and fell for my best friend. So I graduated, and let myself go completely. The only thing I held on to for dear life was my career.

3 years ago, after a medical emergency, I started getting my act back together again. I started from the bottom of the bottom. I started keeping up with my creative pursuits again. I started doing everything I could to be the best man I can. After 3 years, I've only now managed to achieve where most people start. So I'm calling today day 1 with the hopes and dreams that one day I'll be good enough for someone to appreciate me for just existing, and for that person to accept everything I have to give to them. But I'm also emotional, because I don't know if I even have the potential anymore, and I'm operating on 0 confidence.

Tl;dr: I'm trying but don't know if I'll ever be good enough to be able to fall in love because of past experiences, and that made me emotional.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ctzugi/venting_today_is_day_1_for_me_i_just_got_back/,342,There are over 500 million women in India... why don't you try your luck back home? ,2019-08-22 16:30:52
487,7yfcdh,False,None,11,Biggest dating mistakes I’ve made,dating,"22f here, Let this help you guys out, coming from a screw up like me. Learn from this, and avoid doing what I did. 

1. Seeing every guy/girl you meet as a potential love life. 

The truth is a big pill that’s hard to swallow, but that mindset is a sign you’re desperate to fall inlove. Don’t be. Falling in love with you is a privelege reserve to only one person. Stop looking at a person and thinking this could be the one. That’s just adding pressure to yourself and unwanted expectations along the way. 

2. Opening up to people too much. 

I used to think that people will open up to you if you open up to them. No, not really. Well,at least not immediately. 

Let them earn the real you. It takes time. 

3. Rushing 

There was this boy I met, Philip, It was going good for the first part. But I think I scared him away because I wanted to be with him as soon as possible. 

You see everybody is afraid of the idea of committing, thats why dating is hard. We’re afraid of the risks.

4. Focusing too much on a person 

Enjoy your life. If he doesnt reply, so what? Then go do something you enjoy. WatchTV, go jogging, talking to him isnt the only thing you can do. 

If he cancels, then go make other plans. 

The only person you should focus on is you. 

To whoever reads this, Love is hard. But how do you know you can love someone else, if you cant love yourself ? 

🌸",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/7yfcdh/biggest_dating_mistakes_ive_made/,346,#1 is sad actually. That screams desperation if you think every guy you meet is potentially the love of your life. Its natural to be excited about dating someone and wondering where it could go but this shouldn't be happening everytime you meet someone new that has date potential. This says you don't have enough going on in your own life that you end up focusing and rushing... which is another two of your points.  ,2018-02-18 16:38:23
488,ccot7g,False,Tinder/Online Dating,250,Ghosting is just rude and hurtful,dating,"So I'm messaging this girl back and forth for a week straight before the date flirting, getting to know each other etc. 

We go and have the best first date Roller Skating.. no times of silence, both having a laugh. After the Roller skating we drove back near hers. Watched the stars whilst chatting some more.. she came to me for a kiss before we parted ways. No indications of the fact she didn't have a good time.

Following days replies slow dramatically with ""work is really busy"" ""might not be able to see you at weekend i suddenly might be busy"" then they just stopped. I'm sorry but I've been brought up so if you just don't like someone.. or the chemistry wasnt there you could just tell them. How difficult can it be to say ""I'm sorry i didn't feel a connection, good luck dating"" instead its radio silence doubting everything you did on the date not knowing if it was something you said or whether she'd simply started talking to someone else. Its emotionally draining to put your heart into dating for it to get so easily rejected. 

TLDR; A week of constant messaging from online dating. 
1st Date went really well (at least i thought so).

490,bf6e0g,False,Tinder/Online Dating,135,Ways for guys to improve your online dating profile.,dating,"When you date online, Tinder, Bumble, OKC, you are literally selling yourself. 
You are telling the world:
""hey pick this one, I'm not a serial killer and I'm actually a pretty cool guy to be around."" 

That being said, here are a few tips for your dating profile to help with your sales from fellow swiper.

 Pick your brand and stick with it. I'm talking to you 25-34 year olds. This could actually work for girls too but I haven't seen many girl's profiles to give an accurate assessment, maybe you guys can post some girls tips in the comments. 

Back to it: Perception is reality. Seriously think about who you are trying to attract.

Tip 1: If you have a picture with a kid, I'm going to assume it's yours. 
If you don't want me to assume it's yours, don't have a picture with a kid. 
It doesn't make you seem eligible or paternal, it doesn't send off signals to women that you are okay with kids or want them in the future, it makes you seem like someone who already has a kid. 

Nothing wrong with having kids, but if that's not what you're going for and you don't want people to assume that the newborn on your chest is your kid, don't do it.

Tip 2: If every picture on your page is 6 of you and your closest bros at the bar/a wedding/night out, chances are you all look the same and I don't know who you are. 
One pic, maybe two is okay. 
It shows me that you're socialized and people have deemed you worthy of being around but anymore than that is straight up chaos.
I shouldn't have to work to identify you on your own profile.
I don't want to see your entourage, I want to see you. This can be especially bad for you if the guy you are standing next to is hotter than you. 

Because now I'm looking at your friend thinking:""okay nice.."" and then the next to last image is in fact, you alone, not the friend I had been looking at in 6 of your other pictures. 
Oof, welcome to shadowlands aka digital friendzone: a place where even if you are cute, I know I can't swipe on you because I already acknowledged your friend was the most attractive one in the crew and planned what our kids will look like in the future. 

Limit the bromance pictures.

Tip 3: No matter how funny you think it is, you wearing a speedo/banana bathing suit/being seminaked/wasted/
from that one time things got crazy with your boys doesn't really paint the best picture of you. 
Same goes for doing foolish, dangerous stuff.
I'm talking to you, guy welding in your underwear with no protection. 
Get your shit together man. 


Tip 4: If you have a pictures where you are suggestively embracing females similar in age, I'm going to assume she is your ex and you can't let go or she is your current partner in some poly relationship thing. At the very minimum you've swapped bodily fluids before. That's just what's going to happen.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Tip 5: If you have a picture of your dog, you should be in the picture with your dog. You are a package deal with the dog, the dog doesn't come on its own, he doesn't need his own image, it's your profile.

Tip 6: I dont give a fuck about your truck. I am from California, I am not fluent in Chevy.
Also why? Why would you put your car on your dating profile? Maybe some people are totally down for that but do you really want people to date you for your car?  

In hindsight, I realize this may be a geographic thing. 

Maybe there are some women who need to know you have a truck before they swipe right on you. 
If you fall into an area with those requirements, carry on. 
I just want there to be more to your life than your lift kit.

The same goes for profile bios like: 
I own my own house. 
Like okay,
my guy, we get it, you're adulting. 

It's important to note that owning your house in no way directly correlates to you having your shit together. 

Tip 7: After hella swipes, unless you are sitting pretty at 12.5 on the hotness scale, chances are your face is not that interesting on its own, so write something in your bio. 

ProTip: Noone gives a fuck about you liking tacos. You're basic as fuck.

And do not put something super douchey like: 

""No one reads these things,"" - They do.

""You want to know something just ask me."" - hey, what kind of toothpaste do you use?

 ""Not going to waste time filling this out"" - News flash bro, you just filled it out. 

Most of these things have a pretty short character limit. 

You're inability to sit still for 5 minutes and describe yourself says more about you than you think.

Stop being difficult and put something in there so I can start a conversation with you about something substantial outside of ""I like your face."" 

It's not edgy or ironic, it's annoying. 
Why show up in the first place if you're going to half-ass it? 
I get it, you're a rebel, ""blahh fuck the patriarchy"" or whatever. 

Don't use your bio to complain about ""No one ever ever responds on these things."" 
It's probably because you don't have anything worth talking about on your profile and 3 of your pictures are subjectively funny memes, just saying.

News flash 2.0: You're not cooler than the rest of us lonely bastards trying to connect with someone to make existence you know, less lonely. 

'Do not pass go' tips:

Don't take pictures holding money. -just......why?

Don't take pictures chugging alcohol. - ""hellzz yeah, I drank a lot of posion really fast, in complete disregard for my abused liver."" Yum. Boyfriend material.

Don't use your golden days/high school pictures if you don't still look like that. 
- That is a lie. You should not lie.

If you have kids, put it in your bio or in your features that you have them. 

Don't surprise me with your four kids after I enjoy talking to you for a bit, that is a dirty trick.

If you're bald, don't use pictures where you had hair, that is also a lie. 
See above about lying. Chicks dig bald guys. 
Live your truth man.


Tip 8: Stop using cropped pictures, cutting people out or putting emojis on their faces and giving the excuses of ""I don't take pictures.""
I still see that chick's hand on your stomach from that time at the beach.
Motherfucker, take a new picture. 
Make an effort. 


On second thought, all that extra work of cropping and pasting probably took longer than you just taking a picture.

I think I look pretty good, abs and whatnot, I'm just not ""big"". I dont set the bar high for myself, I know I cant date women much taller then me. I have almost no expectations for women other then dont be overweight or rude to people who dont deserve it. Other than that, I have super low expectations. I've joined a few dating apps and jeez are they soul crushing. I'm up front about my height and get almost zero matches or even interests. The only women who tend to show anything are overweight women. I'm sorry that's a standard I set for myself and I make sure I'm in good shape. I'm not attracted to overweight women. Now I dont know where I sit on my looks, gay men tend to love me and that's cool and all but wrong team. I've had some extremely good looking women in my life that like to hang out with me and keep me around but never in a romantic way. Which is fine, I dont expect myself to get some of the girls I've made friends with, as they are straight up 8s or 9s. So I dont think I'm a bad looking guy then. I feel like I'm just going to end up alone because it's not fair to even be in a relationship with someone you're not physically into. I'm just so defeated. I cant be the ""man"" women want and I dont have much energy left to put into this. I just dont get why a lot of short women dont date around their height. I'm too short for the short girls and I'm too short for the average girls. I feel like if I say any of this out loud people will just attack me for being a woman hater. I mean women physically change their appearance to make themselves look better with makeup but I'm too short to date even though were the same height? Ugh. I'm just sad.

Edit: I understand you may be going through the same struggles but some of you have a lot of hate behind your words. I dont believe in spreading hate like that, even if I've been the one suffering in silence.

Edit 2: Alright guys, I wanna thank a lot of you for the support. My takeaways from this, there are a lot of women who care, some that dont. A lot of other angry short guys here.

We continued talking on and off today, just general chatting because I was working but I wasn't unresponsive. I just went to message him and see how his night's going and saw that he unmatched me.

I'm not looking for an explanation as to why; I know I won't get one and it could be a million things. I know it was just a few hours but it seemed like we have a lot in common and have similar senses of humor, and I was excited about the date. 

The carelessness people treat each other with on dating apps is just so frustrating and these tiny rejections are starting to wear me down. I took a 5-month break from OLD at the beginning of this year and think I might need another one.

This isn't me trying to say anyone owes me anything if we haven't even gone out yet, but it's hard not to get bogged down by it.

Also I've asked guys out after just a few messages and then had them turn out to be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. I'd rather waste a few hours chatting online and getting to know them a bit than actually spend the time getting ready for a date and the money on drinks only to find out they're a piece of shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/e2s7d6/the_apps_are_wearing_me_down/,329,"<I'm not looking for an explanation as to why; I know I won't get one and it could be a million things>

Ive been single for 3 years now and in this time no one really has caught my attention. I've dated but I don't usually see someone for more than 2 months. After my breakup I focused a lot on myself and I think this has changed my mindset. I recently went to my best friend's wedding and noticed that love is something that I lack and want but I don't think I'm capable of anymore.


When I saw how they looked into each other's eyes at first made me feel like the feeling they have is something immature. Something I use to believe in but no longer. Almost like something I grew out of. It wasn't until I made the best man speech it really hit me that maybe I'm wrong. My friend was kind of the goofball friend who fell in love in college and completely changed. He's a doctor now with a wife. She changed his life and made him a better person.

I  want someone I can grow with and share memories with like them. Unfortunately, these things aren't something you can just ""get"" but is acquired over time. I just feel maybe I'm the problem.

Objectively being more physical attractive on dating sites will get you more matches, it just will. I’m not a physically attractive dude, I am about average I don’t work out but I eat very well and firmly believe I’m repping team dad bod. I’ve been single for about six months and I’ve been dating seriously for maybe 4-5 weeks at this point. 

In that time what I’ve noticed is that every genetic piece of advice you get is both correct and incorrect. I am not physically fit or attractive I have a relatively attracted face but objectively my female friends have put me at like a 5/6 I’m as they’d put it “Fuckable but nothing on Ryan Reynolds.” 

I offset this with my personality, now the issue with online dating is how can you use a personality to hook someone in a few paragraphs/A photo.

What’s worked for me is embracing my flaws, I’ve got a picture on my profile of me imitating fat Thor. I’ve got one where I’m in a fucking dragon onesie screeching like a fool. They are fun photos and I’ve gotten more conversations out of those than any of my professional pictures, which I also have on because I’m dressed up and look nice. I tell people I’m a massive nerd in my bio and people ask about those hobbies. You don’t have to be Ryan Reynolds to get matches, but you do need to create a hook that makes someone WANT to talk to you.

I’m not saying it’s perfect or guaranteed, but I’ve gotten more success out of going all out and embracing my flaws and making jokes out of them than trying to hide them.

I get about 85% of my dates from offline, without even trying. 15% online. Online requires more effort because you have to meet the person twice: once online, and then again offline.

Because I can't reply to everyone, I just want to say thanks so much for all your replies, the concensus is more or less unanimouse that **""If it's not a Hell Yes, it's a No"".** The *reasons* for interpreting such mixed signals as ""No"" are still worth debating....

PS/ 2nd Edit: I'd like everyone to remember that while many women do give mixed signals and ""lead men on"" the motive for that is not always manipulation!

Feeling like they're not good looking enough, like they're not interesting enough, not tall enough or make enough money, etc. Let me tell you, I've been there so many times before. I've been on and off dating apps over the past several years, all at different times in my life , and for different reasons (looking for something casual, something serious, just out of boredom)

I've had a decent amount of success on these apps (by success I mean simply landing a date with a girl, regardless of whether anything more happened with her after), but I've definitely had more failures than anything. And like everyone else, I'd beat myself up and constantly wonder what I did wrong: did I not choose the right pics? Was my opening line poor? Was I too straightforward? And so on

This bothered me for a long time, because I genuinely thought I wasn't good enough for a lot of people. But this past year I've made a genuine big effort to improve myself, physically and mentally. I'm 20 days away from turning 30, yet I'm in the best shape of my life, I look fantastic and have been dressing better, and I've finally learned what it's like to be a truly confident person. Also importantly: I've been noticing a lot of girls checking me out, smiling at me, etc

Why do I bring this up? Because this past weekend I wanted to ask a girl out that I'd been crushing on, only to find out she has a boyfriend. I wasn't necessarily bummed about it, more like ""Well, I don't really know anyone else I'm interested in, maybe I could get on Bumble and see what's up""

Then I stopped myself, and I thought, I've made all this positive, great progress so far, why mess it up now? I'll probably get on Bumble or Tinder, not get many decent matches, and then be left wondering, again, if it's because I'm not tall enough or not make enough or whatever. I've gotten enough good vibes from people in real life to know I can do better than what I'd potentially get on an app

I know I'm not the only person who's keeping away from dating apps for the sake of their confidence/anxiety, and I also know that plenty more people still struggle because they think they're not enough

But you know what? You are dudes. All of you. Are you a little shy or introverted, maybe awkward and not sure how to talk to people? That's perfectly fine. There's lots of people who are like that. Are you worried you're not good looking enough? You're probably better looking than you give yourself credit for, and if you feel like there's room for improvement, it's not as daunting as it may seem: get yourself in shape and get some new clothes. You'll see how wonderful it all feels

This isn't something that happens overnight either. I've been working on myself since the beginning of the year, and with each passing week I'm still learning new things about myself, about mindfulness and confidence, about positive self-esteem and loving myself. It hasn't all been smooth sailing; I've hit a few road bumps along the way, but something else I've learned is how to better deal with those bumps. Setbacks don't feel so bad anymore; the highs are gradually getting higher, and the lows aren't as low

This can be you, because if I can do it, you can too. It's just going to take a lot of patience, dedicated effort, and persistence. If you stick with it, you'll get there, I promise

But wherever you are right now in your dating life, just remember: don't take Tinder, Bumble, whatever you're using, too seriously. Most of the people on there are either on there for the attention, don't know what they're looking for, or have such ridiculous expectations that they're probably not worth the trouble anyways (if a girl's deciding factor is how tall you are, or a guy decides based on how quickly you sleep with him, they weren't for you to begin with)

These two pics are from the last month or two. They're both probably two of the best pics anyone's ever taken of me (for different reasons):
https://imgur.com/7uDsRTI

https://imgur.com/0ygcDPg

Sometimes when I'm feeling a bit low I look at them and remind myself, shit, look how far you've come, and how much farther up you could go still. And, again, I'm just under three weeks away from hitting 30. I know people from high school (my age and younger) who've let themselves go, have basically given up, etc. I wasn't the best looking or most athletic when I was in high school or college, but I wouldn't trade what I have right now for anything

Again, this isn't something that is unique to me. I don't have any special powers or talents or shortcuts that got me here. It just takes times and perseverance. But I don't have a doubt in my mind that all of you could reach where I am too (if you're not there already) 

Love yourself, and the right person will come around. That's why I decided against installing a dating app: I'm not in a rush, and I have too much on my plate to be worrying about why I'm not getting the matches I want

I've been an active user on this sub for a few weeks now and I just want to start off by saying how much I appreciate those on here who offer empathy to those who are getting ghosted, friend-zoned, misled or straight up rejected. It always hurts, but nobody is alone in this and we all feel the same pain at some point or another. So thank you to the ""empathizers"" out there <3

Here to offer some basic advice, title says it all really. If you're coming to this sub asking for advice on how to understand or interpret something about the person you're dating (what they're looking for, what it means if they text at X frequency, are they dating other people, do they see me as a lover or just a friend, etc.), often times the best solution is simply to talk about it openly with that person. Of course your approach and delivery will matter (e.g. don't come off as assuming they are sleeping with other people because your question might be interpreted as an accusation), but generally I think this advice is more applicable than people might think. I understand that sometimes it's just a question of courage: it's much easier to create a throwaway and ask this sub knowing whatever the responses are, it's not the response you'll necessarily get from the person you're dating. But sooner or later, the only way to get that response is to ask them directly. 

Well that's it. Kudos to everyone who are putting themselves out there despite your past shitty relationships, your rejections, and your insecurities. For the vast majority of us, *dating is* ***not*** *easy*, so for all the would-be lovers out there, keep your chin up and remind yourself that whatever stress you might be feeling when dating someone new, chances are the other person is just as stressed as you!

519,c61hkv,False,Venting,153,Modern Dating: an observation,dating,"To start off: I speak in “us”, “our” and “we” on occasion, because at the end of the day, we’re all in this together. Whether we want to accept it or not.

Here are some things I’ve noticed about dating, and dating apps in general, that might be summarized best with a comment from a conversation I had with my dad: 

“The issue here is that you’re trying to force something to work that, inherently, does not work.”

While there are success stories from people who have found love and stability via these means, I’m keying in on the fact that those are far and few between heartbroken reports of ghosting, catfishing, benching, breadcrumbing, half-night stands, and all of these other trendy coined terms to describe the slaughter going on out there in the dating world today. 

It has become easier and more “effective” to build rotations of 4+ people and networks of individuals that require little to no emotional investment or effort, are a text away from hooking up, with almost Amazon-like speed deliveries of a person from the internet to the flesh, to satisfy instant, and likely fleeting, carnal needs. First sign of trouble or friction? Next! Get back on that app and keep swiping, keep avoiding, stay expecting. Chasing that perfect “hit”. 

(Sure signs of abuse are exempt here, once you know, you go.)

Let’s say you develop genuine feelings, and somehow decide to date a person seriously moving forward. Can you guarantee that they’re not using the app while dating you? No! Can you guarantee that they meant it when they said they’re not on the app anymore? No! Among other scenarios that can play out here, the point is, TRUST has likely been lost in the foundation of the relationship, wherever it may end up...Unless both parties make it their business to respect and maintain it. Therefore, most relationships are already set up for failure, and at this rate, none of us should really be surprised that it turns out that way. 

Which leads me to the next point: most responses to dating failures seem so numb and devoid of true passion and deep reflection, that there is no real fight remaining for relationship building and sustaining as a purpose.

Relationships require time and attention, and it’s far too tempting nowadays to siphon that time and attention into superficial things like social media, likes, and that perfect selfie. Why? Because these “things” likely light up the reward systems in our brains like the addicts we’ve become, making the addiction to gratification and stimulus more important than our boring, monotonous, real-life connections to one another as human beings. Why settle down with one person and pay attention to building and growing slowly with them, when you can indulge your senses on the buzzes and vibrations of validation, flashing lights, fancy animations, jazzy notifications, bells, and whistles, and haptic feedback from your smartphone to dive back into the endless possibilities of the digital double life?

Also, recognizing a genuine connection in its infancy, and having it suddenly disappear without a trace no longer has the emotional protection and m support of a strong and morally grounded community to catch it and guide it back to where it needs to be either nurtured or ended with maturity. This may be a side effect of the absence of delayed gratification... massive-scale learned helplessness, or even the evolution of snack-sized wisdom in memes failing as substitutes for bonding over discussion and rumination on real issues and the reasons behind them. 

Instead, it’s seen as “Oh well, that’s that. Tough beans. Just move on.”...Insert a collective, giant, proverbial shoulder shrug. 

Modern dating has become a careless, free-for-all with no common standard of operation nor agreement, lacking measures of excellence. And most importantly, no real marker for when to stop and unplug! Too often I’m seeing people accept these destructive behaviors as natural, to the point where it is evolving into something common and acceptable. It’s being rewarded...and what is rewarded, continues.

And here is my last point: Many of us are failing to call a spade a spade. 

How many people have intentionally removed themselves from sex and dating long enough to truly reflect within upon the behaviors and beliefs they’re bringing to the table that mimic.. parents, role models, or TV? How much of this is learned and replayed through us, ruled by emotions only, without logic and reason? Versus a tried and true collection of “Yes, this works because it works, and I’ve spent time with my peers and colleagues to elaborate upon why it works...and observed the results that show that it works.”

How many are unconsciously seeking to satisfy some repetition-compulsion to repeat past trauma in new relationships to gain a sense of control and power where they once felt helpless and weak? Do we have the courage to address these topics?

How many people are willing to admit that they’re wrong? And that we’re probably going about this the wrong way? 

How many of us are willing to do the real, ugly, painful work so we can finally have healthy relationships with each other?

520,apaqfc,False,Venting,86,30 day challenge of asking how new ladies,dating,"So I have a heart condition that is getting worse and worse, I may not have much time left on the earth. I am seeing a heart specialist about getting a defibrillator placed in my heart, but that has its own list of complications and risk.ANYWAYS, i am 26 yr old male.  I decided that since I may die at any moment due to sudden cardiac death, why not take risk in the dating world. Because of this I am going to be on a 30 day challenge of asking out a  minimum 1 new girl each week, a total stranger, it could be a gorgeous girl i see at the grocery store, or a cute girl at the gym. No more going back and forth in my head ""cmon man, just walk up to her, tell her shes beautiful and ask for her number"" I am just gonna do it.will keep yall updated on how this goes each week.   Give this  an upvote to hold myself accountable.  


EDIT\*\*\*   
 okay so I asked this girl out from the library, she was sitting in the cubicle next to me, ive seen her around and we have exchanged words in the past so she isnt a total stranger, but we are going to dinner Tuesday night! (:

Edit 2/13/19
Sooo went out last night with the girl. Dinner went great, she had a blast. She left her juul in my car last  night and she wants to hangout today and have me drop it off(hanging out the next day seems like a slippery slope, so I told her I would swing by on my way to work and drop it off).   I also have a hilarious NSFW story about the date but Idk if it would ruin the wholesomeness of the post, so maybe I'll just keep it to myself....anyways dinner went great and she invited me to go see hippie sabotage with her, not sure If I'm gonna take her up on that.   
Have a really busy work schedule the rest of the week but hope to ask out at least one more girl by Sunday. 

EDIT 3-10-19
sorry for being totally awful at updating this. Okay so it's basically been around 30 days. I've been super busy with work and applying for grad school. Anyways...um life's been great! Having another doctors appointment the end of the month. The ladies have been great! TBH I started getting really picky with the girls I felt worth asking, only cause I really wanted to be excited about talking to the girl. One big issue I ran into was that the girls seemed to be much more interested than I was. One girl I've been seeing regularly, I go over to her place and she's made me dinner and I've taken her on a few dates, starting to know her sister pretty well also. This is bad cause Idk if I'm looking for a LTR. 
Another girl has been a blast hanging out with, but she seems more invested than I am. We are going camping next weekend so I'm thrilled about that. 
Another girl was really sweet, I started up a convo with her about her shirt and then got her number that way, haven't gone out with her, not all that interested. 
Another girl just wanted to be a booty call but I'm not looking for any hookups so that was short lived. 
I've also been interested in asking out a coworker but I've heard from others she has a bf, however she's never expressed that to me. So not sure what to do.
All in all I'm definitely gonna keep this mentality up, I've learned you got to be selective with who you ask, you can't just ask every girl you find attractive cause you need more than just physical attraction to keep interest. It's been a great experience and I would love to read how yalls attempts went!

525,c1g0yj,False,I Need Advice,162,Where do you meet single women after college without looking like an absolute creep?,dating,"Here's what I've (22M) tried so far:

1. Dating apps - duh. My first choice since the woman can just unmatch if she isn't feeling it. I had some matches and conversations, but they didn't go anywhere. The vast majority of girls on there that are around my age are just looking to party or to stroke their ego, or if I match with someone that is genuine, they just don't respond. I've read up about the stats of Tinder matches, and it's just a giant waste of time from a statistical perspective. 
2. Meetup - as in the website/app. Well, the problem is that I live in Silicon Valley, and 99% of the meetup groups (I shit you not, check it out if you don't believe me) are related to AI, big data, machine learning, startups, or VCs. Like for fuck's sake I already spend enough time at work every week, I don't want to spend what little time I have left talking about work. There are a few ""actual"" social groups on there, and they're either for boomers or they're pretty much dead, as in one event per month with two people going. 
3. Gym - I go couple times a week, but it's not a very good place to strike up a conversation. It's crowded, and people all have their workout routines to go through. It simply does not seem appropriate to approach people in that environment. I've also heard from women that they absolutely hate it when guys try to talk to them at gyms, so I'd prefer not to get told ""get lost creep"". 
4. Work - I spend the majority of my waking hours at work. Unfortunately it's a tech startup which means there is more sausage than Oktoberfest. The few women that we do have are significantly older or married/in a relationship. Plus, it's just unprofessional to date a coworker. 
5. Nightlife - I'm not a club person, but I like going to bars. Unfortunately, most of the bars around here are for people in their 30s and 40s. While I could go to SF over the weekends, I haven't been able to get my friends to go with me (it's a long trek considering traffic), and I don't know how women feel about a lone man drinking at a bar. 

I'm also looking into joining a climbing gym because I heard a lot of young people here enjoying it, and it seems like a better place to talk than a gym. I'm open to any advice, but at the end of the day, I can't pretend to be something that I'm not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/c1g0yj/where_do_you_meet_single_women_after_college/,317,holy shit ... how would any girl find you sexy with all these damn excuses you got.... ,2019-06-16 22:44:58

Many thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/fatbnf/at_what_age_should_you_worry_if_you_have_never/,315,"Here’s my take - never chase women and never chase money. 

Here’s why - women and money are both results of success in your pursuits. 

So in the case of money, It will come if you focus on creating a diverse skill set, networking with people who are successful in your field, furthering your education and working on building relevant experience.

With women, they will find YOU if you take care of yourself, pursue what you’re passionate about, genuinely enjoy being around and getting to know others, and are confident in who you are. 

You still need to put yourself in a position where you are exposed to many women (social events, bars, volunteer organizations, special interest clubs, club sports, etc) but don’t look at them as dating prospects but more as people who you can get to know. 

You HAVE to be confident in the fact that you will be ok no matter what happens. Internalize than and make it your motto. People come and go, jobs come and go, experiences come and go. If you develop that mindset you’ll learn to enjoy the process of meeting people and going on dates but if things inevitably don’t work out, you can just brush it off and move on.

529,eu623e,False,I Need Advice,109,This guy is keeping me on the hook until something better comes along and it sucks,dating,"I met this guy on Tinder over the holiday break. We have a lot of common interests and there was a connection straight away, and we have messaged every day since. We had our first date a couple of weeks ago, a week after matching. We talked a lot, we kissed, it felt like I'd finally found my match. But I've noticed over the last week or two his conversation frequency has massively dropped off - it used to be we'd be talking constantly from start to end of the day. He'd check in with me and ask about my day. Now it feels it's a chore for him to talk to me at all.

I've asked him about it and he says he's still interested, he just doesn't have a lot of time to throw my way. But that sounds like bullshit, right? His time now really shouldn't be that different to when we first matched, so why is there a problem now compared to when we first met? I get that conversations die off a little after a while but to not even ask how I'm doing now and then? Ugh.

Also, there's no sign on the horizon of a second date. I've tried suggesting meets but each time he's had to cancel for one reason or another. And every time I try to bring up the what's going on conversation, he says he's still interested and we'll do [insert amazing plans here] next time we go out without ever actually planning said second amazing date.

Aaaaaand now that I've typed all this out, it seems crystal clear I'm in limbo. Anyone know how to self-resuscitate, or gracefully pass on to the other side? Have you ever been in the same situation before? What would you do?

All a man has to go on when he first sees a woman is how she looks.If he doesn't find her attractive theres not much that can be done nature tells him move on,he can fight it but it's an up hill battle.

I dated several women that I wasn't attracted to they had nice personalities and where  good women,but It felt as if I was climbing and endless rope the whole time forcing the relationship.I knew I could never fall in love with these women.

""I'm not just here for sex"" I read this all the time online.Sex is nature's way of letting a man know and feel love ,acepted and desired.The way women need hugs, kisses,txt doors held open,flowers or gifts and their birthdays remembered to feel desired,men need sex.

I dated several women in the past and the eventual ""you only care about sex"" line always came out a few months into the relationship.I have a high sex drive 3 or 4 times a week would be normal for me but that's not all I care about.I care about a woman being funny,interesting,intelligent,having goals,I care about her dreams and passions,but none of that makes me feel wanted or desired.

I read a comment before  where a woman said"" she cooks for her man does laundry cleans the house""

I'm a fairly successful guy, I actually pay people to do all that,and my mom would do it if I let her.

My point is doing my laundry and cooking doesn't make me feel wanted and desired it makes me feel like your my mom.

I had a GF cheat on me with another man she explained why. She said she found him really attractive she would go out of her way to see him and they would have all kinds of sex.Meanwhile she would never initiate anything with me,and when we did have sex she was less animated than a sex doll.

Men and women are fighting nature in this era there's a complete disconnect.

My only advice to guys is don't chase women if she likes you,you won't have to ,she will go out of her way for you.

The only thing I can say for women is of the guy is around he likes you.l,he likes sex to but that's how he evolved,so if you like him don't make him jump through hurtles.

532,g6dxan,False,Other,40,People need to take a step back and look at the reality of things.,dating,"People overthink dating way to much, especially in regards to texting and online dating, often they will subconsciously assume that dating life is like what it is on some tv show or in movies or how they see everyone elses lives. 
That dosent reflect reality. 

A lot of people have insecurities or are insecure because of either how they were treated from past relationships or because of how they were brought up in family dynamics. 
And this can cause major trust issues. 

Unfortunately the way we see the world as kids will often shape how we see it as adults and can lead to unrealistic expectations of ourselves and others. 
Especially in unstable or manipulative family dynamics. 

(edit):  Alot of people do not know what they actually want or need and how to communicate that in a healthy way. 
We go by what we “think” we should have or do in a relationship, not what is actually best for us, because there is so much stigma from society and other people in general. 
Therefore some may find themselves in relationships or situations that they never actually wanted wether they know it or not, making them confused and miserable. 

Every relationship is different and has its own dynamics depending on the people in it. 
You go with what feels right, depending on the situation. 

Just because someone wants to take things slow or dosent text you back frequently dosent mean they are not into you. Or that they disappeared suddenly or left for a while. Things happen in peoples lives. 
And if they do ghost you, then they are not worth your time. 
You move on and try again or work on yourself if you think you have to. 

Often more then not people that take the time to get to know eachother will have better relationships then those who rush into them simply because they feel they have to be in one to be validated or valued as a person. 

People have thier own lives outside of dating and to have a healthy relationship you will need that.

She seemed really interested and was setting times and just seemed keen on meeting up with me.

When the day we would meet up arrived, she told me just a couple of minutes before that she would be bringing her friends (she said 5)*. At first, I said ""ok sure"" but deep down I was pretty nervous because the whole thing was unexpected.

When the time came, she brought like a whole crowd (and I mean like 15 or so [in total]*) of friends and I have never felt this uncomfortable in my life. I knew that all of them knew that I was trying to date their friend, and I just wasn't mentally prepared to handle that [the girls were giggling when I tried to talk to the girl I was originally interested in].

Just when I thought I'd handled them well, she brought in another group... and another group... [4 groups of 5, 3, 4 and 3 in them, and yes, SHE BROUGHT 3 DUDES too]* it was like they took turns and waited outside so that they could specifically come in to talk to me [whenever a group would leave, the next group would come in like the wave system you'd see in a video game lmao]*. I ended up being thrust into conversations with new people that I just didn't want anything to do with for the night, life's been busy enough with all the work I have and I just didn't feel like having small talk with loads of strangers who I knew nothing about. 

[While I was trying not to seem too disinterested while talking to one of them about the stuff they did, out of the corner of my eye I noticed that girl just... observing me and smiling in a funny sort of may the whole time and actively tried not to get into the conversation even when I tried to pull her into it]*.

[Sooner or later]*, they all just ended up just hanging out with each other [outside, leaving me alone in the place]*, so I just left when I realized that I'd rather be spending my time finishing my work than entertaining this sh\*t.

I felt like I was humiliated by her and the whole group who's probably laughing at me for not being chatty or charismatic or wimping out.

I know that some girls like to test how well their next potential partner will integrate with their friend groups, but I just felt like she forced me into a social situation that I didn't want to be in, and I now fear ever approaching any other girl ever in my life. They will ruin your day.

EDIT#1: Looks like her friends know one of my colleagues from work and I really find it sickening that this story could possibly leak into my work life. I just wanted to meet a girl that was outside my social circle so that even if it didn't work out, things won't go any further than that.

535,evorrs,False,Question,154,"Women who are in a relationship with someone who puts in less effort than you, why?",dating,"not a rhetorical question. I am actually trying to understand the priorities of such a relationship dynamic.

I have friends who are in LTR or are married to men who visibly put in much less effort than the woman is putting. Small things such as deciding where to go on a date or arranging for activities that will make them spend quality time together are done by the woman. She will plan for days and get him an elaborate gift and he will respond with a 'thanks, babe!'. Like that's it? The catch, however, is that they seem quite happy in this dynamic. It seems as if it is expected of her to be putting in more effort than the guy is putting. Is it? These friends btw also think that I expect too much out of the men I am dating. I am wondering if that is true, or if I am chasing something that is ungettable, or if one person in the relationship will always put in less effort and it has got something to do with personality types. I understand that there are differences in love languages but I still would want the guy to show me his emotions as much as I do to him.

536,ehjvv1,False,Giving Advice,43,"If dating doesn't serve you, take a break",dating,"So I'll just throw this out here...

I read so many posts from people who are fed up with today's dating culture, OLD, flakey people, getting ghosted, emotionally unavailable people, etc...

And all I can say is...

If dating doesn't serve you...

*Take a break.*

I've played the dating game for almost two years now, since my last LTR ended, and I've had so many bad experiences. I've always chalked it up to meeting the wrong people, bad luck and today's dating culture...

At some point I sincerely felt burnt out. I was depressed and lonely and just couldn't understand why I always had such bad luck in finding someone, anyone, who would just appreciate me...

And then I met up with an acquaintance and we just chatted and I told a story about a night out with a girlfriend of mine.

The story itself isn't relevant but it was one of those evenings where you meet up for ""one drink"" which then turns into a full on party night. And I told him how there are just some people that you can't meet up with for just one drink because it always ends up like that, the two of you just always end up escalating. 

And then it hit me...

It's not them.

It's me.

Those friends you can't just grab one drink with?

*I am also that friend*.

I am the one who let's it get to a point where we order shots at some point although we both agreed we shouldn't.

I am the one who let's it get to a point where we stay out until the morning although we both agreed we should head home before midnight.

And it's the same damn thing with dating.

I attract what I send out into the (dating) world.

I set myself up for failure simply *because I'm trying too hard to find a connection*.

I attract emotionally unavailable people because *deep down inside I am emotionally unavailable myself*.

Because being emotionally available means more than being open to date and have a relationship. It means to be content with yourself and that includes being content *on your own* and having a settled sense of yourself. 

I am just trying too hard to build connections instead of just letting them build up naturally.

And that means I am not available. Someone who's trying that hard can't be truly available, in my opinion. 

Many of us are just so desperately looking for someone to complete us, swiping left and right as if we're choosing an outfit for the night. As if we'd match with just about anyone and get the perfect relationship as long as the other one wants one too.

We're simply setting ourselves up for failure by trying too hard.

And we get depressed because we don't get the results we so desperately crave.

So all I can say is... I am done with dating. But not in a bitter way.

If I happen to meet someone and we just click, I am more than open for that. But I won't be chasing anything or anyone anymore.

I am done trying to make something happen, putting the focus on something outside of myself. I am taking a conscious break from dating. I deinstalled tinder and I won't be glancing around the room anymore when I'm out with friends.

I'll focus on myself again. 

I'll date myself first and foremost.

Well, technically there was more then just one, and believe me I wish we could’ve just sat in that car and did that the whole night but she’s going out of town tomorrow and had to b up early today so I had to take her hm shortly after. However, I got to kiss her some more before she got out when I dropped her off, so that was good.

Honestly as a 20 year old who had nvr even held a girl’s hand (let alone kiss one) up until this girl I’m with now, it’s all a bit surreal.

538,fknuu9,False,Tinder/Online Dating,118,Tinder date did a runner after dinner,dating,"I've been out of the game for about a year now, just enjoying living on my own and not thinking twice about having a partner. However about a month ago I decided out was time to put myself back out there and signed up for Tinder. I got a couple of matches immediately and the chat didn't really go anywhere, but after about a week I got a match which seemed really promising. We talked for a few days via the app before swapping phone numbers, talked about everything and agreed we'd meet up after another couple of weeks. She was incredibly sweet, seemed really genuine and most exciting of all, keen to meet me and see where it goes.

I suggested going for some dinner, just a casual place I know that does really fantastic Italian food. Then we'd go just up the road to a nice pub. She was happy with this and felt comfortable enough to let me pick her up rather than meet me there (I told her to give my name/number/photo to whoever she liked to make her feel more comfortable etc).

I picked her up on time, I had bought her some flowers which she seemed to really appreciate (said that no one had ever bought her some on a date before) and the chat in the car on the way to the restaurant was cool, no awkwardness etc. Dinner was lovely and she said that she would definitely go back there. I paid for dinner and we left to go to the pub for a drink. She wasn't expecting me to pay and said that she would get the drinks as she didn't want to feel like she owed me anything which is fair enough.

We made our way to the pub and parked up somewhere I could potentially leave my car if we decided to stay for more than 1 and we needed to get a cab home. She asked me what I wanted to drink and said she was going to toilet then will go to the bar. She asked me to go and find a table at the other end of the pub (the quieter end). I text her to say where I was sat and she text back immediately saying ok, be there in a minute.

15 minutes later I'm still sat there like a spare prick at a wedding. I got up and walked round the pub to find that she wasn't there anymore. I text her to say ""have you seriously done a runner??"" and she messaged me back after about 5 minutes to say her ex was at the bar and she panicked and left. She had mentioned during the date that her last relationship ended badly and that she has a restraining order against him. It sounded plausible but I still wasn't convinced. Why would she not text or call me to say ""I'm outside, let's go somewhere else"" etc?

I don't think I've ever felt this humiliated. Especially since we talked about our worst ever dates earlier in the night, and to think she couldn't bear to spend a whole one with me! I don't understand how I could have read the evening so differently to her.

542,aoimgx,False,Giving Advice,55,Friendly reminder that people come on here for advice,dating,"I've seen a few posts recently where people have been decrying other people's questions as ""cringeworthy"" or ""pathetic"". I've also seen a lot of people hammering the OP in the comments calling them all sorts of names for asking a question.

People come on here to ask very vulnerable and personal questions. This is an anonymous social media site. People come on here asking the questions that feel too stupid to ask family, too personal to ask friends, too blunt to ask potential partners. People come on here saying ""I have no idea what to do here, please help me"". Instead of laughing at the poster or acting as though we're so far ahead of the person asking a question why don't we provide gentle advice instead? Teach them what we know instead of putting them down?

Why am I saying this? I have been in a relationship for two years with a girl I met online. Growing up I wasn't close to my father and really didn't have a male authority figure to go to when it came to dating. It was very much a case of figuring it out as I went along, making mistake after mistake after mistake until finally I didn't. I come on here when I get the chance because I genuinely want to help other people with what I learned, what worked for me so that they can have it perhaps just a little bit easier. I wish I had known about this subreddit when I was dating and could have asked questions here; I also suspect that I would have been called 'cringy', 'desperate', 'clueless', 'moronic' and a litany of other insults that are bandied around by a select few on here. It would have shattered my self-confidence and I might not be in the situation I am in today.

And just to clarify, there is nothing wrong with being direct or straightforward. Sometimes we all need to be told to start thinking clearly and make a decision. All I'm saying is that attacking a poster's character or integrity on an advice forum is neither constructive nor useful.

--------------

On the other side of the coin, this is for those of you asking for advice. We all have baggage we carry and we are all unique individuals. Perhaps you're describing a situation that resembles a particularly negative one I've experienced. I will therefore be more inclined to urge you to stay away, when in reality that may be the worst possible decision. I've seen (an admittedly small amount of) comments and posts on here that have echoes of ""men are garbage"" and ""women ain't shit"" which while I think are perfectly valid opinions that probably have some sort of backstory to them, I urge you not to take as gospel just because someone else believes it. Heck, I even ask that you question what you're reading right now, and if it seems like a bunch of nonsensical drivel then please downvote and move on.

My point is this: people are all different and nobody has the perfect answer to your question. We'll all try to provide advice the best way we can but at the end of the day you've got to combine that with your own intuition and make the decision you feel is best.

548,9wcqao,False,Giving Advice,63,"I’m a member of the US Army, let me help you protect yourself against relationship fraud.",dating,"Background: I am U.S. Army infantry soldier with four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I was lucky enough to see some cool stuff in my life. We always had a camera on hand or some combat photographer who traveled with us. I collected hundreds of photos during my travels.

I become a recruiter temporarily for the Army. This is known as a Department of the Army Selected Recruiter (aka DA Select Recruiter). It’s a 3 year commitment and then you go back to your job. Part of being a recruiter is having a social media presence. A professional Facebook page or something like that you can post your recruiting stuff to and photos of your “Army story”. I had hundreds of photos of on my FB page. I’m now back at my normal job and no longer a recruiter so I deleted my social media page.

I first found out my pictures where being used for scamming a few years ago. A nice older lady contacted me (50’s). She has had a relationship with a fake me for sometime. She couldn’t believe I was actually a real person. The fake me was in Iraq and then recently moved to Africa to fight terrorist. The fake me needed money after a few months because I was almost out of food because the “bad guys” destroyed it and I was running low on bullets. Thank god she was smart enough to look further into my pictures and found the real me. I looked up my name and 11 fake accounts popped up in Facebook. The name was usually slightly misspelled or maybe Rank was different or first name was different. Some where easy to delete and others not so easy and Facebook refused to delete them for sometime. Even having friends and family report them did no good.

It end up getting to the point I would have to search my own images and variations of my name monthly. I’d have those accounts deleted and wait another 30 days to do it all over again. The scammers then moved to other social media platforms. Dating websites/apps, Instagram, and so on. To many for me to look into so I just waited until another women would contact me letting me know she has been dating the fake me for sometime on whatever app. My pictures are all over the Internet now and used regularly. I have even seen a fake Department of Defense Military ID used to make the scam more believable. I’ll add a link to it later once I find a good place to host since r/dating doesn’t allow pictures.

So now I’m here to maybe answer some questions and give you advice on how to be safe from the fake me. 

1) Every service member has a base. Normally those bases are local known as CONUS (continent of the US) and a few have some OCONUS (outside the continental US). CONUS would be like Fort Benning GA, Fort Drum NY as examples. OCONUS would be like Germany, Italy, Kuwait, Alaska, Hawaii are common ones. Other services would be similar just different locations. This leads to #2

2) Regardless of service NO ONE is stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan or any combat zone permanently for multiple years. Deployments usually last 1 year or less depending on service before they go home to their main base mentioned in #1. Navy do like a 6 month deployment on ships, Army rate now is 9 months to a year, Air Force maybe 3-6 months and so on. It all depends on their mission, but no one is deployed for multiple years to a combat zone, not even the super super secret Special Forces guys. CIA May be different but those guys wouldn’t tell you they are CIA or even have pictures on the Internet. If your in the other branches feel free to add in your deployment length. 

3) We don’t need anything. The military takes care of us well. They will never leave us high and dry starving in a foreign country. If a “service member” asks you for money its automatically fake. If he is real and stateside and asking for money he is a looser.  You should stop contact them immediately because he isn’t someone you want in you life.

4) Fake ID, I recently have received a fake ID card of me. It’s laughably bad but to an untrained eye it may look very real. No person in the military will send their CAC Card (Military or Department of Defense ID) to a strange lady. If they do then once again they are an idiot and not someone you would want to associate with.

5) People in the military while not deployed have normal lives. I goto concerts, shop for groceries, wash my car, wear civilian clothes. I don’t live Army 24/7 and wear my combat uniform or dress uniform every waking moment unless deployed. If he shows up on a Saturday night wearing a dress uniform for a date he’s a fake. Our work hours are normally 6am to 5pm on average. There might be some slight differences in time depending on duty but that’s a normal service member schedule. A Military Police Officer or someone working as a nurse might have odd hours but your average person has a pretty set schedule unless something “special” is going on. Only time besides deployment someone might wear their uniform 24/7 will be if they just entered the military and are going through boot camp, basic training or a military training school, those are only temporary though.

6) Other service members can’t look up anyone else record. Don’t call your local recruiting station and ask is this person real. There is no database we have access to that will give us that information. Only thing you can do is if something seems wrong have a friend who is a vet or service member tag along on your date and shoot the shit with him (valor check). It’s kinda bad taste but better safe then sorry. OR you can do it yourself by asking for their military email. It’s not top secret to give it out. For the Army it usually looks something like First.MI.Last.mil@mail.mil. Notice the .mil at the end and not gmail.com? If I was wanting to be a douch and use my military status for the ladies why would I care if someone sent me an email to my easily accessed military email account? I’d be like sure.

Please vote this to the top and spread the word and maybe save a friend from heart ache or financial ruin. I know my grammar sucks and I probably have some serious typos. This is what late night reddit posting on a phone looks like.

552,hbd9yw,False,Question,186,How is it possible to even get a girlfriend?,dating,"I just don't get it really, online dating is obviously useless in that regard, but even in really life, lets say I start talking a girl. Even if it goes well and I got her number, the next day she has more than likely forgotten about the interaction and I don't why a girl would have enough reason to meet up somewhere again because of a 10 minute conversation she had with a stranger. Like why would a girl meet up with someone again because of some small talk; does that even happen? 

The only other circumstance I can figure working out is if you see a girl often enough and talk enough that you can maybe get a chance, but once you are not in college, apart from maybe the workplace, I don't think too many situations like that exist.

I dunno, I just don't see how it is achievable to set up, and impress a girl enough to even go on a date.

My boyfriend of 4 months believe it or not we met on tinder. We both had genuine interest, good intentions, and the chemistry and communication was there, and we worked for it. Not everything was perfect; we misread each other, misinterpreted, etc. but we really liked each other and saw potential. 

I had been single for well over 4 years up until him. Lots of “almosts”, flings, short term dating that fizzled out, and a handful of “casual” encounters that were mostly fruitless and disappointing. I used tinder, okcupid, rarely bumble.. 

The day I met him was seriously in my head the last time I was going to use an app. I was going to let it go, and wait for the universe to make its magic. And then we matched, and that was that. 

Be patient and be kind to yourself. Decide what type of woman exactly you’re looking for. Put it out into the universe, and be ready and willing for it.

I've been dating this guy and I am thinking it is going really really well. I think he is boyfriend material, but am wondering if he could start feeling the same?

We've gone out 5 times. He waited until the third date to ask me back to his, so I am thinking he is looking for something more stable than just a hook-up. He wanted to see me for a fourth date knowing it would be an early night with no possibility of sex due to schedules, which I also think is a good thing. 

He told me that he showed his friends my pictures and said they are all very curious to meet me. He did try to invite me to his friend's bbq but I was working... From what I am told guys typically don't bring you around their friends unless they are thinking about something long term. 

He will be away to visit home for a few weeks but made sure to see me the night before leaving. He said things like to make sure I don't forget him while he is away, and that he wasn't excited to go home anymore since he would be leaving me. He even made it a point to text me during his layover.

554,bgukoq,False,Giving Advice,93,A personal guide to how I went from being friendzoned and constantly rejected to not having a problem meeting women and going on dates.,dating,"Well after I loss 90 pounds I learned some things that helps with meeting new women:


•Find a hobby that you enjoy. 
 
 -it gives you something to talk about
 
 -women love hearing about your passions

  -it gives you confidence in SOMETHING. Since I didn’t have confidence, I try to find the good attributes about myself and it eventually builds up to solid, unconscious confidence.


•have some good wingmen
  
-if your friends have a hard time getting girls, y’all will just look like a group of weirdos. They don’t have to be your closest friends, but be around interesting and funny people. A group of women can often hang out with a group of guys and then they try to pick which on they want so make yourself stand out. 
 
-it’s easier to start a conversation with at least one other person with you. Girls go out in groups, you should too.


• just talk to her
 
 -I personally go up and ask how they are doing and ask if I can stay and chat. If there are things like beer pong or pool, invite her to “get her ass beat” she’ll wanna be competitive.

  -BE FUNNY. I had no confidence in my looks so my humor was an attribute I focused on. Once you get her laughing, don’t stop. I promise if you see an ugly guy with a hot girl who isn’t rich, it’s guaranteed that he is hilarious.
  
-ask her if she’s from the area or visiting. It’s always a good start up question. (Helps if you are traveling because you get to talk about traveling)

  -honestly, asking how her day is going works too. Even if she says “good” “fine” “okay” you can follow up with how your day is going in detail. If she engages, she’s interested, if she doesn’t, she probably isn’t.
 
 -EYE CONTACT EYE CONTACT EYE CONTACT. Chin up, shoulders back, hands visible. Look at her like you have interest in her. As my friend put it, look at her like you want to fuck the shit out of her (not in a creepy way) (alluring, seductive eye contact that says hey I like you) Essentially you want to completely give off the vibe that you are talking to her with interest and not just some stranger who wants to have a little chat.


•Good hygiene.
  
-there is no “bad hygiene day”. At least not to the girl you are trying to talk to. First impressions are everything. 


•it’s like door to door sales
 
 -it’s a numbers game
  
- door to door sales taught me how to hear “no”. No big deal, just knock on the next door. If you have a good approach, it WILL work, but like sales, everyone doesn’t want your product. Rejection is okay.
 
 -use what works for you and learn from your mistakes. If you think “shit I shouldn’t have said that” or “shit I should have said that” then just try it next time.


•Have at least one female friend 
  
-remember that girl who friendzoned you? Tell her you want to get out and date but you want to fix your approach. I was in the friendzone, but she was still a great friend. She told me she had a single friend but I better not ruin it by talking about politics. I laughed and she didn’t. She told me that nobody wants to hear about politics and religion all the time (or any controversial issues) and it scares people away. I didn’t even notice it until she told me and now that I look back a few years, I wouldn’t want me either. There might be something you unconsciously do that scares people off. Now I know what NOT to talk about and my success rate went up.
  
- she can put you with friends. If your lady best friend goes out a lot, she meets new girls all the time. One thing we all know is that cute girls have cute friends. It also gives you and the new girl a conversation starter. Say your friends name is Jane, the conversation could start about how funny it is that Jane set you two up and now y’all can talk about memories with Jane to break the ice.
 
 -she will make you the best tinder profile. I know a guy who’s attractive but had no luck on tinder. He gave his lady friend his phone and he got 12 matches daily. Girls know what girls like.


•good places to go
 
 -yoga. I personally enjoy yoga for myself but there are always women in there. It tends to be more successful when you establish that you are in the class for self improvement and not for eye candy. It actually makes you more interesting since most guys are too “masculine” for yoga. Don’t be surprised if you get approached. One thing going to yoga does is it gets you comfortable talking to women. They might be curious to know what a confident, comfortable, non creepy, single guy is doing there and they will ask. Just do you and enjoy yourself.
  
-meditation classes, like yoga this is another place where women (especially college aged) go for self practice. You might bump into someone who does yoga and boom, you have something in common. Ask her where she goes and if you are super lucky, she might go to the same place as you! Now you have a familiar face at the meditation place and yoga place. Also, young adult meditation classes typically have things like picnic days, bar nights, and other social events. Social events are meant for you to be social after all, this is your chance. Even if you only become friends with these women, you can use that to meet more women. They might have single friends and so and so forth.
  
-a bar. I try to go in a group of no more than 4 men so it’s not intimidating. Bonus points if you have 2 or 3 girls with you. It’s easy for a group of people to strike up a conversation with another group of people. Even if you go alone, everyone is drunk and doesn’t have their walls up so talking comes easy. Always smile when you approach.
 
 -the club. Essentially the same thing with a bar. On the dance floor, go up to her laughing and smiling and ask to dance. Look fun and be fun. If you are turning up with your boys and you feel a butt brushing up against you from behind, it’s a good chance she wants to dance. I was dangerously in the friendzone with everyone I tried with about 2 years ago and now I normally dance with 20 to 30 girls in the club. I typically don’t try to get numbers just because I genuinely go to dance, but I’ve had a few offer their number. My first time st the club, i talked to some girls and convinced them to come to the dance floor but I didn’t know how to dance so we ended up standing around until one of them literally grabbed my and started dancing. After they left, I looked at the guys who were getting all the girls and then looked at the ones standing around with their arms crossed. As a guy you can see the lack of confidence in them to go dance and if you can see it, women DEFINITELY see it. so I decided to do the exact thing that the successful guys were doing and after a few visits to the club, I became comfortable with my approach. I may sound like a hoe but I promise on a night where I danced with 20-30 girls, I got rejected by another 15-20. I personally don’t consider myself attractive, but confidence goes miles.
  
- the military. Being in the military helps a lot when you go to pick up girls because if you can’t think of anything to say, you can at least bring up being in service. And I don’t mean go out to boast and brag, I mean it’s a good response to if you’ve established that you aren’t from the area and she asks “what brings you to the area”. Realistically, there are a lot of women who love military men. Because of that, you need to be CAREFUL when looking for something long term. If I go out for a good time, I can mention military (tho I typically don’t) but if I’m looking for a relationship, I tend to save that until after I know she wants me for who I am so I don’t risk getting with someone after my benefits. If you’re in the navy, you get to travel everywhere and all sorts of crazy ass stories to talk about so you get comfortable talking to women pretty quickly. Not to mention that boot camp gives you confidence boost because you eat, sleep, breathe, shit, and shower with 100 alpha males for 2 months straight. You come out being EXTREMELY confident and sometimes borderline cocky. 


Go to the gym fellas. If you feel like you are too skinny, eat right and work out. If you feel like you are too fat, eat right and workout. I put on 20 pounds of beer belly but I can still get around. Try your best to maintain your top shape. You will be happy with the body you worked for! Women love a man of action and commitment and going to the gym is a great way to establish it. The best time to go is whenever you REALLY don’t want to go. I’m not some jock hotshot who has girls drooling over him. I still have insecurities. I still get nervous talking to really cute girls. I still have down times. But all of this has helped me improve greatly and at least got me to the point where I feel like I can go out and find a partner in the a week. I prefer to stay single and enjoy that while I’m the military. All of this is based off of my personal experience so I can’t really speak for anyone else. I’ve helped a few guys get out of the friendzone and into the dating scene with this advice and I hope I can help some other men across reddit. Please let me know if this works for you or not. My PMs are open for anyone with more specific questions.
 
Just remember this, even the hottest guys on the planet hear no. Rejection is okay guys.

I know that sounds bad, but I feel like I haven't had a ""fuck yes I want to date you"" situation in a long time.

Is it just me, but I miss the feeling of having a crush on someone and it feels like it's been forever since I've felt that. I'm 27 and before all this Covid stuff, my group of friends would always go out with each other to clubs/bars, but we would never meet anyone new. I know that it's one of the issues, but are other late 20's experiencing this?

When I bring this up to people, they always say ""you gotta find someone on a dating app,"" but I really don't want to meet my SO on one of these apps. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with that and I have many friends who have met wonderful people from dating apps. I just want that ""crush"" feeling before I get into something serious and I feel that apps don't do that for me? I am on all of the apps, but I just feel like it's so superficial!

Does anyone else feel like this? I know that Covid is making things WAY worse...I'm just worried because I'm catching myself saying ""They would be good for me, maybe I should try it out,"" instead of saying ""I have a crush on this person and I want to see if they have mutual feelings.""

Now you have to think whether or not they'll think you're a creep for merely approaching them or worry about them changing their mind about the nature of your sexual escapades despite both of you being intoxicated beyond mutual consent. A lot of this comes back to men being the responsible one with the outrage culture destroying whole careers of people off of an unsubstantiated accusation. The same does NOT happen to women as they're often given a slap of the wrist for the same crimes that destroy men. Not to mention the lack of vindication when a false rape accusation is exposed..

And you think we're gonna have feelings of excitement with the prospect of a new date? How? I say something wrong I risk losing my entire career.

TL;DR - Get off of online dating, be confident and approach/show interest, be active/interesting, realize your standards.

Hello Everybody!

I've seen far too many posts on here from women complaining about how hard it is to find guys. Dating is hard for both genders, but unless you're 35+ you should have no issue finding dates. Here is a guide on how to do so.

1. Don't be overweight. I'm sorry, but that's the way the world works. Overweight guys get the same shit overweight gals do. Sure there are some lump cuddlers out there, but they're a rariety. Looks are half the battle. Humanity is superficial. We know, get over it.
2. Turn off online dating. Online dating for guys is utter...shit. Okcupid did a study and 80% of the women went after the same 20% of men. Let that sink in. So many guys just don't give a shit about online dating, even if they're on it. Why? Cause if they didn't their egos/self esteem would be shit (and for a lot of them it is). So they don't take it seriously or anything that happens on there seriously. I've also found that online dating may lead to a ""burden of choice"". Some women I know would go on 2-3 dates a week (each with a different guy from bumble) and complain about not finding someone. Everytime she'd have the slightest inclination that something is better on the next swipe, she'd drop her current person.
3. Go outside. Literally, go out and do anything that doesn't include yoga, cafe, and eating. Here are some things I've observed. All of these I've seen typical bros, nerdy engineers, pot smokers, practically every flavor of guys.  

   1. Coed sports. I live in a major city and everytime I join a team, it is usually 4 gals per 10 guys.
   2. Meetups. I've been to all sorts of meetups. Ranging from fitness ones, to bonfires, to drinking, art, and everything in between. The ratio here is even worse than Coed sports. I went to a ""singles"" night. 20 women, 70 guys. Yeap. There are Meetup group owners who create fake accounts of attractive women to get guys to show up.
   3. Cooking classes. Not counting couples. Most of the time it is a 3-1 male to female ratio.
   4. Festivals. Esepcially anything related to beer (brewing for example). Metric ton of guys walking around
   5. Live shows. Especially anything that isn't hard core electronic. While I hate labels, think ""hipster"". Live music with an actual band. The underground/dive bars that aren't destination bars are great for this too. Just be sure it is in a ""young"" area.
4. Approach. Get this bullshit execuse of ""if he doesn't have the balls to approach"". No, don't give me that shit. You're using that to put up a mental defense to execuse not taking chances. To execuse not making yourself vulnerable. Learn how to show interest. You don't have to approach, sure. If you do it, you'll get a ton of dates and meet a lot of great guys. But if you don't want to go that far, learn to show interest. Look at a guy. Seriously just stare at him. Then when he looks at you smile for a few seconds, then look away. Boom, there's the secret sauce. The chances of that guy approaching you just went up tenfold. If you're sitting there eating looking away, reading a book, or literally doing anything other than staring at the guy...90% of the guys wont approach. Guys are conditioned from an early age that approaching is bad/rude. No idea why and each guy usually develops this differently. But most of them are to scared of coming off creepy, rude, or bothersome. Not only that, but guys notice other guys approaching and striking out in bars/public places. It just takes once or twice of seeing a gal get angry at a guy for approaching for them to get turned off from attempting it themselves. Some guys I know approach constantly at night. A lot of them constantly strike out. Usually its because guys approaching in public is tough. What do you expect them to talk about? How you and him both like drinking beer? Hard to build a raport off of that.
5. Be interesting. Don't give me this busy bullshit. Everyone is busy. You're going to be busy for the rest of your life. Don't use that as an execuse to not be interesting. If I ask you about you and your answer is ""Religion/God, Coffee/Food, Yoga, Beach, Drinking, Dancing, Travel, and Work"" (or worse less than that), you're as basic as they come. Goes for guys too, but if you want to get the great guys don't be basic. That simple. Find something that is interesting to talk about. Volunteer, be passionate about something.
6. Learn to have a conversation. Some of my girl friends suck as conversations. Guys approach them in public and its like they're interviewing her. Then they ask me why it didn't work out. Ask questions about, show emotion, show interest. Not doing this gives off this vibe that you're expecting HIM to impress you. Don't do that, they pick up on it fast. Chemistry goes both ways. Don't expect it to just happen, it needs a catalyst.
7. Realize your standards. Some women I know are cool people, but by god do they shoot high. They may be a 5/10 in the looks and personality department, but they'll only give the time of day to guys who are walking models with super successful careers and other great shit. Hey, if you can snag someone like that and they don't have a shit personality...do it girl. But don't lock yourself down to 10/10s.

I hate to plug, but seriously look at Matthew Hussey on youtube. Most of his free videos bring up points about dating (especially when it comes to getting guys) that is 100% true. There is a lot of solid advice on there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/bjrlli/a_womens_guide_to_dating/,286,"Hahahahahaha damn girl I'm 36, was overweight even more so than i am now and met my FINE as hell boyfriend on Bumble last year and we are going strong.

567,ep1vn9,False,Other,138,I thought he was the one.,dating,"I met him a few weeks ago on a dating app. 
We chatted, conversation was going so great. 
I tried to manage my expectations, because we all know face-to-face interaction holds the real weight. 

First date, it was unreal. 
I've never ever felt like this before.
I've never felt so comfortable with an internet stranger, so connected on so many different levels. 
Conversation flowed like a dream. 
I smiled so much my face hurt. 

I've never actually been in a relationship before, so if you'd just ask me what I wanted in a partner, I could only give you a vague description with no concrete details. 
But this man, I thought *he's exactly what I wanted*. 

We talked, joked around, held hands and hugged. 
Pretty sure that's no big deal for most, but for me I've never felt so comfortable with someone on the first date. I am a very guarded person, but with this man, I let down my walls *just like that*.

He told me he'd always felt the need to rush home on his first dates.
But he told me, the worst part of our date was that it had to end. 
And I told him I was so scared, because I've never felt like this before. I felt so afraid that this wasn't real. 
And he told me not to overthink, to just follow my heart.
And for the first time in a long while, I let myself believe his words. 
I really, really believed that he's going to be someone special in my life. 

But fast forward 2 weeks, plus after another date that went well, he stopped putting in the same effort. 
He used to text me once or twice daily, but conversation died down, and he didn't try to continue it. 
I told him to let me know when he's available for our next meeting.
He said okay. 
And then he didn't reach out for a few days. 
Then I suggested a date, he told me he had something on. 
And then nothing, no alternative date, no explanation that he's busy. 
Then I suggested another date, *nothing again*. 

By this point, my heart sank. 
All I wanted was some kind of indication that he wanted to make the effort. 
But there's none. 

*So I let him go.* 
It was the hardest decision I've made in a while.
I told him that thank you, I had fun but maybe we're not really right for each other. 
This time, he actually replied, saying that he's just tired. 
But he agreed to my statement that we're not really right for each other.

If he had just said that he wanted to give us another try, I would have caved in. 
All I wanted was less than a minute of his time to just simply tell me that he's busy, and will get back to me later.
*But he didn't even do that.*
I wasn't even worth a minute of his precious time.

I know deep down I deserve someone who's willing to put the same effort as me into making a relationship work, but I still can't help but think *maybe I was wrong, maybe I should have just waited*. 

And I'm just trying to get all this out so I can feel better.
It hurts so damn much. 
*Because he made me feel things I've never felt before.
Because he made me believe in love again.* 

But alas, I guess *we're just not really right for each other.*

Or maybe I might regret this forever.

Edit: 
Thank you for all the responses, guys. I accept all of them even though some may think I'm coming across as needy/clingy. That might be true. And I agree I should work on myself too.

Also, I'm from a relatively conservative country so I don't think kissing on the first date is all that common. I have been on a couple of dates and none I felt as comfortable. 

Another thing was that he did mention that he's been ghosting pretty much every girl before me after the first date, and never really got to the 2nd date. Is that a red flag? I'm not sure but it did make me think that perhaps he's just waiting to do the same to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ep1vn9/i_thought_he_was_the_one/,288,Don't use dating apps. ,2020-01-15 12:45:56

But at least for me, when I am swiping, eventually I'll get to a point where I literally swipe left through 50+ people in a row that I would classify as unattractive.

Make sure you make effort in your dates.

570,gsvvbg,False,Venting,83,Stop Stigmatizing Virginity,dating,"Some of us are virgins in our 20s or older not because we are religious, prudes, asexual or crazy but maybe just maybe we would like to do it with someone who respects and cares for us as people and not objects for their sexual pleasure.

Edit: I'm a virgin for several reasons. One i cannot be aroused by someone I have no emotional intimacy with. I rather sleep with a old friend of mine, even with the bad history we had, then a man I know knows nothing about me and will never be interested in how I feel what I have to say.

2. 99.9 of men who approached me wanted to sleep with me without even knowing my name while claiming to want a relationship. But their insistence on sexualizimg the conversation and going to their house so early in dating revealed their true intentions.

3. I am a introvert and I had very few if any friends throughout my life until fairly recently when I joined a commune. Even then my social network is pretty small and that translates to less opportunities to meet men thay may share my interests in real life. So I have to go through the trash on online apps in hopes of finding that one gem of a guy out of 100s that is interesting, interested in me and respects my boundaries and is not interested in hooking up. It's very hard to find.

Edit 2: I am so happy at how many people resonated with this. Its great to be reminded you are not alone and a freak of nature, even when the society around you treats you like one for being a virgin. I never expected the amount of responses and support I got from people lol. Also, positive note I met a guy today and he was very chill, respectful. Maybe because he is Eritrean ?

Also that she's still probably down for coffee. I declined because I didn't want to interfere with any of that. I'm glad it wasn't bad..

All in all, 9.9/10 would recommend just taking the plunge. Psyche yourself up, do whatever you have to do. I won't lie it stung a bit, but a few minutes later I was back. Maybe it'll be slightly awkward when I see her again but I'm past caring. Next time I like a girl enough to embarrass myself for, I'll be posting again👍

Sincerely,

A increasingly confused and frustrated guy

_-_-_-_-_-_-_--_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-



Made this today during the time on which I should have been on a date had I not been stood up once again. Figured I'd put my frustration to use with something so that you guys can have a laugh either with me or at me.

In all seriousness though, I am doing my very best to keep any frustration and jadedness out of my interactions but it's getting harder and harder. It's starting to look like I'm going to have to take a break.

Why do girls agree to a date enthusiastically and then either ghost or just not show up? What would be the harm in saying ""sorry I'm not interested"" and unmatching? At least we wouldn't be wasting each other's time!

Since I started seriously doing the online dating thing 2 months ago, I've had 21 girls agree to a date in principle. Of those, 1 has come through. 12 have flaked (even though 10 of those confirmed they were in fact coming the morning of and just never did) and 8 have just stopped replying when asked when they were free. I mean just... why? I see girls complaining in their profiles all the time that they're looking for someone who's serious, that they want someone to finally take them on a date, someone who makes plans and sticks to them. These are the same people who then turn around and mess me around instead of just letting me know they're not interested when I ask them to meet up. 

And I get what people say about why people ghost, but the fact is most of these situations we haven't had each other's social media, numbers, last names, addresses or anything like that. Even if I did blow up and go psycho on them (which I absolutely wouldn't) it would be a matter of unmatching and that would be that!

It's the exact same flow chart as approaching in any other form of communication. If it's online dating that frustrates you, perhaps consider reflecting on what you do differently online versus in person.

And I wish to build a life with that person. I am not religious. I just belive that love and sex is intertwined and should be between 2 people who will take on the world together. (also take into account my definition of virginity means no sexual acts of any kind) 

So there is a man I am interested in, and we have been chatting for over a year now and finally the topic of sex came up and I explained my views that I am waiting for marriage to have sex and I explained my views on the subject.

His response was first shocked, he first asked how can a attractive woman not have sex into her 20s? And then went on talking about how my views are a bit childish, but good at heart.

Since telling him this information although we chat everyday he is more interested in me. Although he has brought up marriage in the past with me before this conversation twice (I rejected him both times before), he seems to be pushing for marriage again. And wants to meet my parents and tells me about how he can be a good provider.

My question is why is it now that he knows I'm a virgin is he pursuing me even more than before, it's almost like he's scared to loose me now that he knows.

It's as if lately we encourage highly emotional decision-making in dating and rationality is getting lost. When did it become not OK to have some doubts when first getting to know a new person? Why isn't it OK to question or challenge your feelings about a new person? Serious relationships can develop slowly. Can't it be argued that a slow steady relationship build is preferable to quick and careless, so to speak? Using critical thinking in new relationships sounds good to me, rather than going with highly charged instincts. 

Full disclosure, my recent semi long term relationships started with ""hell yes"" and little questioning. And they were all bad decisions in the long run. So this question of *where did rationality in dating go* is partly personal as well as a general observation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/fwma3s/explanation_for_hell_yesno_culture/,277,"I think you're misunderstanding the concept.

576,dd8hb2,False,Venting,234,I've been ghosted by 28 of my last 30 attempts at dating,dating,"First of all, by ""attempt at dating"" I am refering to having either matched and subsequently talked to, or met and subsequently talked to a girl. I dont count getting ghosted directly after a match by not getting a reply to my first message.

Also, I have stopped double-texting long ago. If you dont reply to my message within a week, or, even worse, leave me on ""read"" for a whole week, I consider myself ghosted and will remove you from my contacts.

I consider myself an average looking guy, a 7 on a good day, slightly chubby. I work out but I guess I need to work on my diet as well. 25, got my own place, own car(s), working in IT. In many ways I am a stereotypical introverted nerd, with the exception that I usually dont have troubles communicating with people. Which makes it even worse to be ghosted, since it just shows that even more ""socially adjusted"" people are worse at communication than a ""socially awkward geek"".

Since the beginning of 2019 I had roughly 30 shots at dating women as outlined in my first paragraph. From a dating app standpoint that might not be alot, but what can a 6-7/10 chubby geek do, amiright?

Of the 30 girls I met 8 of them through normal means and 22 of them through OLD. Honestly I dont try to differentiate between the two, OLD should just be a shortcut to meeting people the normal way anyway.

I actually **got a second date with ONE** of them. In fact, I got all the way. Best sex I have ever had honestly and we had a brief FWB thing but it ended when she actually got a real boyfriend, since I wasnt looking for a serious relationship at the time. Still, she was probably the most mature out of all of them, and she was 22 years old.

Another **one** was up-front with me, albeit only 6 hours before our first date. Apparently she had another date the day before and the guy was so great she was going to just roll with it. Might have been an excuse, might have not, but at least she told me anything.

And thats where the ""positive"" experiences end and the sad shit starts.

**Three** of them ghosted me after the first date. Fine, I probably didnt make a good first impression. Maybe I just wasnt attractive in person. Maybe I was overbearing, or too quiet. Maybe there just wasnt any spark. But please, telling me ""Sure, we can do this again."", then ghosting me two days later is the worst of the worst.

**10** of them ghosted me after exchanging numbers, which is probably the weirdest thing. In modern day dating culture exchanging numbers is pretty much the equivalent of being ""in"". If you give somebody your number you kind of let them into your social circle. So why ghost them right after? It literally happened to me that I got a girls number, we exchanged like 5-6 messages on Whatsapp and then I was left on read forever. Why? Just why?

And the **15** others, well, they all ghosted me on a dating app itself, which I dont consider worth talking about, because its (sadly) just par for the course. Get a match, talk to match, get a better match, ghost first match and so on and so forth. Ive learned to not even waste a single thought on people who ghost on dating apps, because its just that easy.

Overall it paints a rather sad picture. I am not mad for not having gotten laid with 30 women, in fact over half of them had in the end turned out unattractive for me, but even then just getting to know them for some much needed perspective is always fine for me.

What makes me sad is just how less others tend to care anymore. Dating is no longer about getting to know other people and see if youre compatible, its fishing for your perfect opposite which will never exist and everyone else is just thrown aside. And OLD is nothing but a game these days, except with real people. 99% of people on OLD actually have zero space for more people in their lives, they just like the brief distraction and confidence boost of playing the game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dd8hb2/ive_been_ghosted_by_28_of_my_last_30_attempts_at/,282,"Do you actually have any interest in these women or are you just trying to date any female that seems like she might give you a chance? You are more likely to have meaningful and lasting interactions with women if you actually have something in common, even if that means less ""chances"" of dating someone. 

People not responding to you while chatting on tinder is not ghosting. They lost interest for whatever reason. They don't owe you an explanation.

Is it just me or is modern dating damn frustrating and depressing?,dating,"I am \[28M\] and I've never had a serious relationship before. I was one of those people who didn't really look into dating until I was probably around 26 years old when I finally achieved my career goals - I am a fulltime health professional and own my own house, car, things I want in life etc. Doesn't mean I didn't take fancy on anyone or thought about dating but I was more focused on my career, enjoying life with friends and family prior to that point.  I did like someone at uni, been close with her and unfortunately before I can make a move, she moved to the other side of the country because she changed uni and we pretty much drifted apart.

I've done every dating app under the sun since I was 26. Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, POF and just recently CMB. You guys probably know what sort of people you get on those apps. Dead accounts, bots, people who ghost you for no reason, people who deleted their account despite you guys having good banter, people who only want sex etc. Bit of a nightmarish journey (I even had a girl who said that 'I dont date enough women' when I complimented her on looks...I mean seriously?). Been on tons of dates with mostly disappointing results (but plenty of hilarious dating horror stories as a result). Hell, I even signed up to eHarmony this year after one of my close work colleagues promoted it because one of her friends found her husband on there (""Because if people pay money for it, they'll know what they want and actually want to date""). It's been 4 months or so since I signed up. Matched with a dozen or so girls but most of them dont respond to any messages (Oh great, just like those dating apps). Dated a few. And guess what? Not much different from the 'free' apps.

And when you finally nail a second, third, fourth date, it just fizzles either due to red flags or ghosting/rejection. I speak to my sister and my female friends about my dates and yes, we all screw up sometimes but most of the time, they pinpoint the issue being with the date and not me (""It's not you, it's her""). I am kind of introverted but people would describe me as bubbly, kind, funny and easy-going. I dont think I am bad-looking either (I am no Henry Cavill but I score plenty of matches easily on apps). Why is it this difficult? I take breaks for sure from dating but when I finally head back in, it feels like running a gauntlet of unpleasantness to the point where I think I should just give up and become that cool single rich uncle who's always travelling the world.

Not only that, you have to put up with the judgement of your colleagues, friends, family and relatives. ""Oh are you being picky?"" ""Why do you not ask her out? She looks nice!"" ""Wait you dont have a girlfriend?"" ""Oh so you're not seeing her anymore? See you scared her off!"" ""You'll find someone - you just have to put yourself out there!""

I know modern dating is hard but is this what other people have to put up with too?
Maybe I should stop 'trying/being pro-active' and let destiny take its course -  ""You'll find love when you stop looking""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/du79j7/28m_okay_ive_had_enough_is_it_just_me_or_is/,276,"You sound like a geek.

583,bvf6pe,False,Venting,77,Great Date Takes a Hilarious Turn...,dating,"Hey guys, i’ll try to keep this brief but this is hilarious and I had to share somewhere, so here I am. I (21F) am not a big “dater”, i’ve been single most of my adolescent life all but a few flings, the longest of which lasted 6 weeks! Lol with that being said as I am coming to the end of my college  career I have had a lot more free time and my girl friends decided they wanted to hook me up with someone. So they set me up with this guy (22M) who was a mutual friend through one of their boyfriends.

They gave him my snapchat and he snapped me almost immediately. I didn’t know what I was expecting but when I opened it I was actually pleased, he was really handsome. So we talked back and forth for about a day or two and then I gave him my number and we arranged a “date”. We went to a bar off campus, one of the nicer ones where drinks are kind of expensive. I didn’t know what to expect from him in person, he seemed cool through text but that can be deceiving.

After a couple of drinks I really actually like the way he was acting and treating me but obviously everyone puts their best foot forward on the first date. Anyways he made me laugh and smile for like 3 hours or so and after he asked if I wanted to go back to his place with him to hang out some more. So I agreed... I didn’t get the vibe that he just wanted sex.........

We left the bar and he drive me back to his place, “Whenever you wanna go home i’ll give you a ride just say the word” is exactly what he told me. He lived in this nice apartment complex on campus, while we waited on the elevator he kissed me which I was okay with. His place was nice, and tidy. His roommate fled to the room almost on cue when we came in. We sat on his couch and ate Ice cream, he said it was all he had to offer which was cute.

Anyways, we watched a little bit of Rick & Morty, then the alcohol caught up with me and I had to pee. I asked where the bathroom was and he showed me then I went. I peed, and stared at myself in the mirror for a second. I go back out to the Living room, and there sits my date.... Only he doesn’t have any clothes on, and no underwear either. LOL, and his dick was hard......  and big.

I stood there in shock, partly because he was naked, and partially because of the size of his dick lol. The only sentence my dumb ass could piece together was “Oh my..” He just looked at me I couldn’t read his expression, but my mouth dropped open and i covered it with my hands. He laughed a little and said “No?” and started covering himself up then he told me he was really sorry and asked if I wanted him to take me home. I felt really bad but I said yeah, I really liked him physically and like we clicked but i’m not a first night kind of girl. When we got to my place he apologized again. I told him it was fine honestly and then before I got out of the truck I said “Let’s hang out again, & maybe i’ll see your dick again sometime soon.” He smiles and laughed really hard, he said let’s definitely hang again and apologized and kissed me and told me good night.

Lol I really like him he was goofy and that just was really funny and I’m supposed to see him again tomorrow, kinda nervous lol! If anyone ends up caring i’ll update this haha!

I carried the conversations and eventually she asked to chat on Messenger instead. She said she swiped me right because I’m an INTJ and I couldn’t really put this anywhere, lol. Conversations started to be finally more two sided. We had the “past relationships” thing come up and she talked like she is always wanted by guys and she treated them like trash, but: “you’re different, you’re funny, good looking, etc”. She kept sending me actually REALLY good selfies. She even sent a few one captioned “no makeup lol” and she was still beautiful.

We eventually set up a date after a few weeks of talking (work and stuff got in the way on my part). The day before we were meeting she told me how “this city’s air makes her skin look like shit” but she still sent a selfie and still nothing to be bothered about. She also kept saying how she is out with her friends and guys keep checking her out. I was like weird flex but ok. The day comes, she texts me “I’m not wearing makeup today btw” but I was like okay sure it’s fine, I prefer “natural” look anyway. We meet up and wow. I’m not all about looks but her face looked NOTHING like the photos she sent me and the ones she used on Tinder. I’m not saying small details looked off, but I swear nothing looked “right”. 


She hugged me and told me I look so much hotter in person than on my photos (I hate photos of me and I guess it shows lol) and I simply said “yeah sorry but I can’t say the same”. She obviously got awkward and admitted that she likes to draw and play around with photoshop, etc and she always touches up photos. I figured if there’s chemistry, fuck the looks let’s give it a go. The date was so bad. Like top notch awkward. I ended up telling her I don’t want anything I don’t have time for a relationship and I just don’t feel the vibe. She said “oooh I don’t want a relationship, I’m always like this with my friends”. Okay sure, I walked her to her bus and headed home. She kept texting me for days. I told her I’m busy with work and we haven’t talked for 2 days now.


What did she expect? I’d fall in love with her through text and I wouldn’t notice/care about how fake she was? She said the friend thing because she thinks she can eventually “win me over”?

I managed to contract a horrible flu from him, have been dead to the world for two weeks ... and now he's asking for clarity.  


I left late at night, telling him that I was uncomfortable. I texted him on the way home apologizing for the drama.

I want to just leave it as is, but he has asked for specific examples for why I was uncomfortable...   


The place was so stinky that it was as if the air was thick?? If it was my job to clean the place up I honestly would have no idea where to start, just burn it down and start fresh? As soon as I stepped foot in the door I felt like I should get out ASAP. He was a really nice guy, a bit socially awkward.

Me and this guy made eye contact... Pretty normal but then i looked away and then i looked to cross the road and he was still looking. 

Then we crossed the road and he started chatting to me. Seemed pretty normal. 

Then he was like “you’re really pretty, you must think i’m nice too hehe” i had my headphones in so kinda missed bits of it but then he asked for my name and where i lived. I said east. He said he lived west. 

Then he said “oh you seem really nice can i get your number or something i’d like to get to know you.

 I was like okay...gave him my number. He’s like when are you free. I’m like not until Friday/Saturday. He for some reason won’t believe this although i’ve told him i have deadlines... 

Then he was like cool, can i have a kiss i was like LOL no. Then he was like “come on don’t be shy.” And i was like “i’m alright thanks.” But he just keeps asking, then asks if i can kiss him and i’m saying “no. I don’t do that.  Sorry.” and then i’m like “right, i’m going this way now...” and he’s like “ok hug goodbye?” 

So i was like fine whatever, and then he kissed me on my cheek and i was like a bit annoyed but it’s a minor i suppose... until i realise he isn’t pulling away like you usually would post hug, he does that lingering around thing fairly close to my face and he then says “how about a proper one now?” 

I was like “are you for real?!” Like i’m pulling away quite aggressively and he’s still got me in the hug at this point. And i’m shouting “seriously, get off me” and he’s like “okok haha well i will definitely see you on saturday.” 

No you definitely will not. 

I’ve blocked his number etc. But it’s still grinding my gears that this happened. He genuinely seemed alright at the beginning. 

Not sure how i always seem to attract the nutters/unreliables/uncertain/inattentive/dishonest ones. 

But a guy i just started dating also decided today that it was too soon for him to date after being out of a relationship for 1.5 months (which is totally fine), but he told me to book mini golf for our next date a few days ago and then we hadn’t spoken over the weekend. I told him i’d booked it and he said great can’t wait and then i’ve been busy this weekend with uni work so today messaged like are we still on? And he was like i had a great time with you but i dont think im ready to date or anything yet and i don’t want to waste your time. I said that’s fine but annoying cause already booked it, he kindly paid me back. And said its a shame as i was looking forward to it and it was nice that we both weren’t wanting anything serious. I think it ended on alright terms, he said he just needed to figure stuff out with himself but he enjoyed meeting and talking to me. Didn’t really have anything to say. So that’s that. 

I’m not annoyed that we’re now not going to date, it’s not a big deal and if he needs time, that’s totally understandable and i said that to him. What i don’t get, is that had i not contacted him, when would he have contacted me?  I gave him the opportunity earlier in the week to be like oh no i don’t want to do anything, before i booked the activity. So i just don’t get why that happened, if i didn’t want to do something or i changed my mind, i would let the person know, when i change my mind. 

Anyways i’m tired of dating. Just gunna do me for a few months. 

Good luck to you all though. Today was a crappy day for relationship things. April & May have both been equally crappy for relationship things actually.

the problem is - he kept letting me know that he was still on the fence about us because he had feelings for another girl as well, and was trying to make up his mind between us two. he even brought it up in the middle of sexting! And it obviously ruined the mood. 

nevertheless I found him genuine in that he was always 100% honest with me, and I believed he really was a good person despite the fishy situation with the other girl. but recently he started showing the obvious signs of starting to lose interest (barely keeping up with the conversation, avoided talking about meeting up, I always had to initiate the talking.. you know the deal).

I knew this was probably because he was already leaning towards the other girl, but I was annoyed that he had resorted to this mild ghosting, instead of letting me know the truth.

I initiated a conversation with him yesterday and we actually had a nice talk unrelated to his situation, but I still felt like something was not right. It just wasn’t the same anymore and he still seemed painfully distant.

today I decided to take that step and let him know that I needed to break contact (I don’t like ghosting and I rather let people know I won’t be talking to them again, even if it’s awkward) because I could see this was clearly not going anywhere. 

I went completely against my feelings here, I did feel a lot for him (still do), but I couldn’t deal with this anxiety any longer. I just feel like I was being strung along and now I realize that he probably only wanted me to hook up and sext. 

His reply was a quick apology and wished me well. I can’t help but think he let me go very easily and this dampens my mood even more.

I feel really fucking sad right now but a part of me knows it was the right decision. all I can do now is let time pass and take these feelings away.

It’s hard to believe half the year has gone by with lockdowns and pandemics and what not. I had really hoped to make this year a good one, after recognizing what some of my challenges were and having a plan to overcome them. 

I had realized some time ago that a lot of this year may well go by before any sense of normalcy or safety returned. More than that, I’m sort of accepting that this whole year may well be written off. I have tried Skyping and video calls with potential dates, but it just isn’t that easy to really progress anything until you meet in person. 

I say to other singles on this sub, it’s probably best to just accept that this year won’t likely bring substantial positive change to our dating lives. And honestly, that’s ok. It’s a difficult situation that most of us can’t do much about.

He seemed really nervous and fifteen minutes into the “date” he said we could go back to his place to hang out and play guitar (btw.. he lives with his parents still). The date continued and I could tell he wasn’t picking up on my jokes or sarcasm. 

We went to an open mic at another bar and I said we should go on, since he kept talking about how he plays guitar and is in a couple bands and I do stand up comedy. He was pretty against it and was adamant about not going up, so I said we could leave if he didn’t want to do it. We leave and I suggest we go to a sushi place down the block. 

On the way, he tries to pull a “you have something on your face, what is that” weird, creepy, non consensual kiss thing and I rejected it immediately. The whole night he kept saying I was being “mean” (I wasn’t— I’m seriously overly nice but can be a bit sassy/snarky at times).

The look on his face when he sat down— it looked like he wanted to kill me. Seriously, it looked like he HATED me. But I kept it cool and was asking if he liked the sake, gave him some history of rice wine, kept talking to make it less awkward. He finally said “you’re kinda annoying me.”

I thought he said something about the sake, so I said “it’s an acquired taste.” “No, I said you’re annoying me.” “Oh.. we’ll I’m an acquired taste.” He then condescendingly asked how long my last boyfriend and I were together and if I annoyed him as much. I told him that he was being rude and apologized for annoying him, but he was free to leave if he wanted to since the sushi was for me anyway. He said “yeah, I’m gonna go.” And he left. 

I’m not even upset. This guy had zero, and I mean ZERO, sense of humor. He couldn’t pick up on my sarcasm to the point that he literally thought I had watched only Beavis and Butthead for the last 10 years. 

I think, and my friends agree, that he was just upset that I wasn’t going to hook up with him that night and that’s why he got so upset. But it still hurt my feelings and was incredibly embarrassing to be left at a restaurant. I really don’t think I was being annoying (I’m a phenomenal date—especially first dates). He was just a huge douche canoe. And even if I was annoying, he could have gone about it a different way. 

Anyway.. just needed to vent. Btw, I literally hadn’t seen this guy since we were 8. Ten minutes after he left, I got a text saying “We’ve been friends all these years, no reason to act like that... sad.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/a7iumk/on_our_first_date_i_was_told_i_was_annoying_and/,263,"26 and still lives with his parents?

Also, dudes are most comfortable being the one ""on stage"" on a date; the funny one, the entertaining one.  A funny woman can be intimidating, or...see, funny people (or people who think they're funny) love attention; its an end in itself.  Historically, the funniest woman I ever knew was also a manipulative compulsive-liar attention whore.  So now I find women who make an effort to be funny or entertaining suspicious.

599,eaga7x,False,Tinder/Online Dating,267,I went on my 4th date with a girl from Tinder which ended pretty bad.,dating,"LENGTHY STORY FROM TONIGHT'S DATE.   


So I've been seeing this girl (lets call her ""S"" )for a month now and I haven't made any moves yet because something in my gut told me to hold off until I felt like she was more comfortable around me and what not. Tonight I picked her up, bought our tickets to see Black Christmas (which was ok, but not great), and then proceeded to go to a bar across the street. I don't drink because it just doesn't taste good to me so I don't mess with it. We have a seat at the bar and the bartender comes up to us and says to S ""What would you like to drink?"" S then says ""I'd like a cranberry vodka."" The bartender then turns to me and she ask me the same thing and S says ""Oh he doesn't drink, which is so weird. I've never seen him put any alcohol in his body."" The bartender gives me a look that screams ""leave this chick alone cause she's probably crazy"". She hands S her drink and I say to her ""Damn, why'd you have to out me like that?"" in a jokingly voice. S says ""I just find it weird you don't drink and it's awkward when we go out and I drink. We can't keep hanging out if you don't drink cause it's awkward. On top of that you didn't even pay for my drink which shows your not interested in me. You also haven't initiated anything."" So i'm sitting at the bar like ""Is this chick nuts?"" and say ""If i wasn't interested in you I wouldn't ask for you to go out on dates every weekend, so I don't understand what you're talking about. Plus I haven't made moves because I don't even know if you're interested in me and I know how you get, so i'm not taking any chances until I know you're ok with that. I'm trying to not step over your boundaries. If it's a problem with you that I don't drink do  I need to leave or do you want me to stay?"" S pulls out her phone and calls her friend to pick her to take her to another bar because ""I was going to leave her"". Never said I was going to leave, I just asked did I need to leave because me not drinking bothered her so much. I have to drive home and she was my date so it's also somewhat my responsibility she makes it home safe. I said "" You know that's actually pretty rude you would call your friend to come pick you up when we are on a date and after I said we could go to Indian Queen, but you just assumed I was about to ditch you after you're the one who complained about me not drinking."" She then said ""Well you made it seem like you were gonna leave me. It's not the first time it's happened."" I told her stop comparing me to other guys she's had bad experiences with because not every guy is a fuck boy, smh. She didn't like when I said she was being rude and tried to cut me off during my sentences but I wouldn't let her. She then threaten to leave the table and walk away. I told her ""Go ahead I won't stop you."" I sat at the bar and waited for her friend to pick her up and then I took my ass home. This the 4th dates and not ONCE this month has she said Thank You. Never in my life have I encountered such a rude individual who claims that all the men she meets are fuck boys most of the time. Now I can see SHE is the issue and never takes responsibility for her fuck ups.

TL;DR: A girl stormed out on our 4th date because she was mad I didn’t buy her alcohol (when i bought everything else) and was annoyed that I wasn’t drinking alcohol at the bar when she knew i wasn’t a drinker. 

Update: for those of you saying “you should’ve known” i would’ve BEEN ended this a long time ago but I’ve never seen her act like that until tonight.

Update 2: for those who are saying “why are you going to a bar and you don’t drink?” She wanted to grab a drink before we left so we went across the street. She’s known for a month that i don’t drink and it’s never been an issue until now and idk why.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/eaga7x/i_went_on_my_4th_date_with_a_girl_from_tinder/,268,There’s plenty of fish out in the sea brother.

After a lot of thought, I’ve decided that due to my financial situation (a lot of student loan debt, no savings) I’m going to stay single for 4 more years. In 4 years I will be in a better place financially.. I’ll still have student loan debt, but no credit card debt, a higher credit score, and at least $10k in savings. 

While I know this is the best option given my situation, It makes me really sad to come to this realization. I’ve been single for 5 years already and accepting that I’ll be alone for 4 more years is heart wrenching. I also feel like my opportunity to have a family/child is quickly slipping away.

601,deh41n,False,Other,132,Please don't ghost other people..,dating,"Yeah where to start here.. Im writing this down now because needed some time to process it.. So I (25) matched with this girl (25) on Tinder like over a week ago. We connected really fast and had a whole lot in common. I thought she was out of my league but whatever. We talked for like over a week and she was really cute to me, something I never had experienced. She was always happy when I did an audio message. ""I love your voice"", she said every time.

We planned a date for last thursday and we both were really looking forward to it, we also were both very nervous in meeting. Actually we wanted to meet up way earlier but I was on vacation and she had to work, so our schedule didn't really fit each other.

To note: I had taken advices from girl friends and how they met their respective partners and what I could take into my account. One thing was a friend got gifted a flower (no rose) on her first date and maybe I could convince to like me even more, I thought. So I bought a flower (I don't remember what kind) plus I bought new perfume for out meetup.

So then there is thursday, we messaged all time in the morning like we did the whole week. We both agreed on playing black light minigolf. It was something active to do but not to stuffily going out and drinking a coffee or something. She lives an hour drive away and arrived like an half an hour early. I live 10 minutes away from the place. When she told me that she is already there, I got into a polo shirt and put on my extra bought perfume. I put the flower into my inside pocket of my jacket and drove to the minigolf course. It took sometime to find a parking places but finally found one so I walked to the address. And there she was. She looked even more beautiful than on the pictures she shared to me. We hugged like 5 seconds and it was really intimate. So I gave her the flower she liked the gesture but was not super excited. We brought the flower to her car and then went on to go playing. We both payed and she went to the restroom. I waited outside after like 5 minutes, she got out and said to me she goes to the car to get a blistering plaster. This was the last time I saw her and heard from her.

I waited and waited and waited... nothing. I looked at WhatsApp - no profile picture nor online status visible for me. Went on Tinder - no more match. Facebook and Instagram - not visible for me. Snapchat - deleted. She blocked me on every single social media account. Why? WHY??? I just don't get it. I can't find a reason. Do I have a crooked nose? Did the gifted flower seem creepy? Was it to much? Whats the reason? She just drove and ghosted me right away.

I told the cashier about it. She was really nice and understanding. She offered me to go get friends and play. I called my roommate and explained it. I drove home, threw my bag in the corner and immediately hugged one girl roommate (I know it doesnt matter) and began to cry in her arms. I just couldn't get over it. What did I do wrong? I started trusting her and kinda felt some vibes coming between us. The thing also is that I opened up to this girl the day before about what I feel about my future plans, additionally we talked about intimate things like sex and stuff. Something I never had talked about to anybody because Im like a late rookie regarding that topic.

Anyway we helped one new room member, who was just moving in, unload the car and we as a group of four decided to play black light minigolf at the end of the day so that I was distracted from what happened to me.

I talked about this with my friends but I just wanted to get this rid of my heart. One advice: please guys do not ghost it seriously can fuck somebody up heavily like it did to me. If only she texted me when she was in the car and didn't want to spend time. It would have been hard but okay. The darkness in me still haunts me four days after the incident. It hard for me to get the pictures out of my head.

Thanks guys for listening. Sorry if you find any mistakes, English is not my first language. Also FUCK YOU LISA!!

603,beh8ub,False,Question,58,Need medical help. I'm about to close the deal with a lovely girl I'm dating and I can't stop farting acid demons.,dating,"UPDATE:

(scroll down for original post)

&#x200B;

Before heading to her place I dipped into the HaHa cafe comedy club to rip a couple planks and with them some gas. I thought this was a great sign and that the gas could have only been associated with whatever meal those nuggets were. Laced with broccoli my guess.

&#x200B;

But as I was washing my hands I saw how bloated my guts were, big ol' gas bubble. Dead give away another low pressure system was making its way to the launch pad.

&#x200B;

I swung by Ralph’s to pick up some strawberries and Tangerlos… These fruits are un gas related it was really just not to show up empty handed because she just had a long day. 

&#x200B;

I arrive at her place… I called it a “backyard bungalow” …to explain what this is, in California homeowners outfit garages or backyard structures into studios. This is important to the story because these structures are very basic when it comes to ventilation. Her bathroom had NO FAN. Just a small window above the toilet. It was already cracked, there was no breeze, I could smell bleach so she already cleaned up the bathroom… I looked around the bathroom for anything that was a scented spray… Nothing, not even perfume. Could you imagine Chanel no5 in my ass? Or Chanel no5 farts? There was scented lotion but how is that gonna go? I wipe my ass with rose water crabtree and Evelyn hand lotion? What if it stings my asshole?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*Thought came to me\*\*\* You know those Poo-poorii sprays that you spray onto toilet water and it knocks out the smell? What if I spray a version of that either directly onto my asshole or onto the fabric of my briefs where my fart gas passes through? If the product could some way coat every airborne feces particle of my ass steam with a pleasant smell…. Well, problem solved. 

&#x200B;

But I had no spray and I don't know if such a thing exists. Would love to see that on shark tank.

&#x200B;

To add some color to the story, this girl is a stunner 5’8 Hungarian brunette with a glowing smile. She has a very warm personality and can carry an intelligent conversation. She has a strong spiritual practice that I attribute to her levity, countenance, and big ol' smile. She is a Physical Therapist so she has these great strong arms hands shoulders. 

&#x200B;

She is the tantric type that likes a slow build, push to the edge and back off of it. I am all about this and have the control to play with the brakes and tease the climax. 

However.

That is a hell of a lot of 'abdominal manipulation' read: Marches infantry to the trenches. Twice I interrupted to go to the bathroom to do a standing downward dog followed by pushing my fist into my guts trying to knead this gas bubble from stomach to my butthole. On my second visit to the bathroom I got a nice exit. But like the tantric sex I needed the release slow and controlled… I’m wording this silly right now, basically I didn’t want to blow my asshole out and blow her door down with loud ass fart noises. Again, no fan and a thin door, I’m not trying to kill this Hungarian. I achieved a steady release and it sounded like a motorcycle purring… If that is such a thing. Incidentally, I have a big muscley ass so it ain’t an easy exit, the flesh can create some serious percussion. 

&#x200B;

I don’t know how graphic people get on these things but the next section of the story is the sex…. Here it goes, so, high level is we began and finished with oral, no intercourse. It was intense, breathing was in sync, some serious eye contact, she appreciates physical strength and I was able to provide it… I’m leaving out details here… Let’s get to it. 

&#x200B;

When I was servicing her I was on my knees off the side of the bed hands gripping her forearms, her heels digging into my traps/shoulder/neck. For most of the time, when she’s not arched back, she is looking down at me and we are holding eye contact as I’m flicking away… Here’s the rub. I am essentially doggystyle. I am on my knees, ass out. This is GAS POSITION. Fuggin google it. I’m fucked. I’m controlling this girl’s existence with my tongue, eyes are locked, and I’m trying not to WINCE my face as I seal my asshole against a groaning torrent. That scene in Aliens comes to mind where she's trying to hit the airlock to blast the Queen into space. We’re like deeply connecting right? She’s seeing into me, I’ve got a good poker face, can she see in my eyes that I’m holding this thing in? The thoughts are all happening quick… I want to describe more detail but you get the point.

&#x200B;

She pounces on me, goes super slow down on me. Same ass puckering issue with a second variable: My asshole is out and is inches from her nose. 

&#x200B;

This is when I start thinking of that Poo-Pourri spray again. This is when one would spray it ON the asshole. So, for this theoretical product there would be two applications, a spray for underwear and a spray for butthole. Hell I would put a dissolving scented pill up there. I’m looking down at her and I can see the damn gas ball pushing out my abdomen.

&#x200B;

No, I didn’t rip ass on her. I’m aware this would be a better story if I did but I don't want to make stuff up. I did have to dial in the concentration though because I can’t climax thinking about farts and asshole sprays. Luckily, she is very very talented as a giver so I was able hit the uprights no problem. Hell of a calorie serving she got and as I type my face still has her on it. Which is a better scent than what my ass is giving this couch.

Internet,

I made a ton of broccoli in my Instapot a couple days ago and I have two days worth of steamed broccoli coating the lining of my intestine. I thought if you steam vegetables they digest better. I am murdering the air in this Republic of Pie cafe in NoHo right now and I need to leave in like 30 minutes for her place.

Is there any last minute medicine or food or drink that ACTUALLY achieves nuclear deproliferation of the asshole??

I need to point out that she lives in a lovely backyard bungalow and if I abscond to the bathroom these beezlebubs aren't gonna stay put in her tiny bathroom. Even if I walk super slowly and shut the door immediately they will travel.

I've gotten quite confused regarding this girl \[23F\] I've dated recently. I'm partially looking to vent, and partially looking for the opinion of internet strangers, as I deem I cannot see clearly as of now.

For some background, we're living 3 hours apart, but we both frequent each others' city and we both were even before we started dating. We've started talking \~a month ago, talked a lot through phone & texting, and had a date a week ago.

I felt the date was a success, we connected really well, both of us were chill, no signs of that typical ""first date stress"" at all. We also had sex both in the evening and in the morning, which leads me to think that she is attracted as well.

That's where it gets confusing, as I got the ""let's stay friends"" card from her in a few days. Unfortunately, I'm used to this, I might be too much of a NiceGuy ™, but this is a separate topic. However, this shocked me this time, as I genuinely thought we had a great time, and even before the date, both of us were very clear about that we are looking for something serious.

I've told her in a very polite, yet direct way that I'm not interested in being friends and that we should stop talking to avoid being hurt. Mainly my way of crawling back to my cave, when things go south.

At this point, obviously, I still could not fully understand what went wrong, but thinking that we've discussed this all, I've closed this with simply telling myself ""Not at the right time/right place""

Not even 2 days go by, I get a text from her saying she is confused, missing me and cannot understand her feelings and wants to meet to talk about this, to ""find some other solution"".

How would you decipher this? Is she being pushy on staying friends? Am I misleading myself for believing that this is her way of stating she ""changed her mind?""

I've agreed to meet up and to continue talking (possibly only until the date), but we could not find a closer date than \~2 weeks from now to meet up, which really sucks, as I'm honestly afraid of getting hurt once again in a situation like this... on the other hand, I'm also afraid of wasting an opportunity due to being afraid of getting hurt...

The guys i know, plus the guys on reddit also swipe right on every single girl they see to make their chances better. Understandably so, cast the net wide, you'll be bound to catch something. I cant speak for every girl, the the girls i know dont swipe on every guy, they are a bit choosy, hell, my BFF will send me screenshots of guys profiles and ask me what i think, and we'll talk about it before she makes her decision, thats just before she even swipes right, for all she knows, he might not like how she looks. it got me thinking about how women and men play the online dating game very differently.

&#x200B;

If every guy swipes right on EVERY girl, and every girl swipes right on SOME guys, of course women are going to have more matches. It's over-saturated at this point. Also, just because a girl may have 100+ matches, it doesn't meant that shes talking to 100+ guys. 1/2 of them are bots or catfishes, i guarantee it, many dont answer, LOTS are looking for one night stands and hookups, and then there are maybe a handful out of that group of men are are actually compatible with the woman they matched with. i admit, i get lots of matches, and i message them, but not everyone talks to me, because even though they swiped right on me, i'm not their preference. Ive had guys swipe right on me, i say hello, and then immediately unmatch me lol. It happens to us all!

&#x200B;

Not to mention, people have different tastes, i know its hard to not compare yourself to some Calvin Klein model looking dude and think, ""if he isnt matching with every woman, what chance do i have"". But you have to remember, not everyone likes that, people have different tastes and preferences. I'm short, and i am VERY hesitant on going out with guys over 6 feet, because it feels weird to me, i know that guys who are over 6 feet tall are popular online for some reason, but know that not every girl likes it. Yes, online dating is extremely shallow, and i get my ass kicked on it too, i'll be the first to admit it, but it is a good way to meet people, and not every meetup needs to end in a relationship, maybe a friendship can come out of it. If you find yourself getting in a dark place mentally from these apps, take a break from them, its ok, i do it, my friends do it, your peace is the most important part of this

Stop judging a book by its cover. Just cus a girl has her shit together and is presentable and attractive doesn't mean you're not worthy or she'll break your heart. Stop being afraid to go for it and give it a chance. Stop being so scared to open your heart.

People think being attractive makes it easier to date and they are wrong. I'm nothing special but sure you can classify me as ""attractive"" and smart and somehow this intimidates some men. Great.

 Yesterday i had my first IRL non tinder date from a guy i picked up at a cafe. We had a blast and just chilled in a park making out. it ended up being a great confidence booster and made me excited to try it again. He said i was really forward and that it was refreshing. 

Basically ill just walk by them,make eye contact, and if they seem to stare back ill smile and say something like, ""hey youre a total babe, did you know that?"" 

Theyll usually laugh, say thank you or tell me they think im a babe too and then ill ask for their number.

I think we as women are pretty scared of rejection and are quite used to waiting for guys to make the first move. But i want you guys to know that theres something freeing about being open with your emotions
 Asking out men or flirting makes me feel in control and sexy. It doesnt have to be awkward or silly, although it helps if youre quite extroverted.

So heres a question:

Guys: how do you feel if a woman asks you out? Are you creeped out? Do you ever expect it? Does it make you feel emasculated (as silly as that sounds) also, if i use that line, does it sound like i just want to fuck?

615,er66ja,False,I Need Advice,79,How to get out of the “forever alone/single” mindset,dating,"I’m a 25 year old straight guy and I can’t get out of the forever alone or forever single mindset. I haven’t really had a girlfriend since high school and even that wasn’t a super long term relationship. 

I’ve got a great career and lots of great friends, but one area of my life I wish was different is my love life. I think part of the reason I don’t really have one is I’ve been focusing on my career and stuff so I kind of put it to the side. 

But now that I’m ready to start looking, I don’t really have any confidence at all. I’m overweight which certainly doesn’t help (I’m looking to improve this as well by losing weight and getting in shape, but that’s a different conversation). I have Tinder/bumble and I do get matches but nothing ever comes out of it (mostly my fault). I’m great at talking to women over text and Snapchat but I never actually make the next step to go on a date or hang out with them even though they always ask “when are we going to hang out?” And all that kind of stuff. I don’t know why I just never go to that next step, maybe because I’m not truly interested in them?

I also have never been the type to go out of my way to talk to strangers. If I’m in a bar with friends, I really just talk to my friends and never have the balls to approach a girl at all. Is this some sort of social anxiety or something, or just shyness? 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice from those of you that have been through this kind of thing because whenever I bring it up to friends, they always just say “you’ll find someone!!”

-It helps with your mental health. You won’t be posting on social media in the hope that they see/ in an attempt to impress them. 

-You won’t see what they’re up to, which can make you jealous if it seems like they are living a better life than you. 

-You won’t feel the need to stalk their profiles and think about them.

-You can clear that mental space that the person has been taking up and focus on self-improvement.

I saw a cute girl a few people ahead of me and wanted to ask her out, but didn't want to put her on the spot and make her uncomfortable. I also didn't know if she was leaving home or going home. I got onto the plane hoping her seat was near mine and I could try strike up a casual conversation and she how it goes from there. She was about 10 rows in front of me. I nervously wrote her a note and worked up the courage to walk it up to her. Of course, she was in the window seat. I had to awkwardly ask a stranger to pass a note to another stranger for me. In the note I explained that I thought she seemed like one of those girls that is shy and doesn't realize how beautiful she is. I also mentioned that based on her interactions with the airport staff, while in line, I got the impression that she was very polite and she seemed like an all-around good person. I gave a little info about myself and the general area in which I live. Then, I asked her to text me if she would be interested in going on a date and listed my full name and phone number. Oh, also, I asked her to include the color of her backpack in the text, so I knew it was her. I couldn't actually recall the color at the time of writing the note, but figured this would discourage anyone that might find the note from messing with me for fun. I didn't expect to receive a response from her. I figured it would probably come across in one of two ways, creepy or endearing, but I took my chance.

She texted me back about 40 minutes after the flight landed. Here's what she said:
""My name is Brooke and I was on your flight from New Orleans to Detroit with a maroon backpack. Thank you, for you kind words. I deeply admire you for taking a chance. I actually live in Boston and have a boyfriend who I love. You sound like a great, thoughtful guy, and I wish you all the best in your life! Keep putting yourself out there and sharing what you see in others -- we all have our own (sometimes small) ideas about ourselves, right? Enjoy your Sunday and safe travels home.""

Not to mention that **she even asked me to drive to her place on several occasions** and then refused to give me her address.

*Yes, Reddit... I know I should have spotted the signs earlier and that she likely was using me for attention. But that's besides the point.*

In early December 2018, I matched with this one really cute girl. She was a bigger girl with short, black hair. Our conversations quickly moved over to Snapchat. We immediately developed great chemistry: We shared a lot of common life interests, personality traits, and even sexual fetishes.

We would often sext each other. She would frequently post sexy selfies on SC where she would show a lot of skin, and this would sometimes lead us to sexting when I complimented her. I would also sometimes send her snaps in order to get her attention.

Anyway, 5 months passed and she never met up with me. I was played like a fool; every time she came up with an excuse ""I'm PMSing"", ""I'm sick"", ""I have a party to go to"", ""I got called into work"", etc. and even when she asked me to come see her, she never gave me her address. So I ended things. But I noticed one really hollow and unfulfilling aspect of this.

I never got any compliments. Not a single one on how I looked. She never complimented my hair, face, eyes, body, member, no, NOTHING. I got *ONE* compliment telling me how she loves a ""thick daddy"" (I'm 6'2"" and 201 pounds so just a tiny bit chubby, not overweight). I would always compliment her on how sexy her stomach/boobs/ass/thighs/etc. looked, and she loved it and ate it all up. But I NEVER got any compliments beyond ""cutie"" or ""sexy"". Nothing *specific* as to how I looked.

I know that I'm not ugly. My physical appearance is something that I'm quite confident about, and I have been described as having ""no bad features"". But good lord, I cannot even begin to describe how un-sexy this whole ""relationship"" made me feel.

This is partially because of me not feeling so good at the moment and having a hard time rejecting people if we dont click. Which leads to me being only half as honest I would like to be with people. And thats important!

But also because of the feeling that dating on tinder feels forced and unnatural. As in not a normal situation to actually meet a partner for the first time. I know lots of people meet eachother online and it probably is a good method, but not for everyone. I went on 5 dates thanks to tinder and I've felt that most of them does'nt seem genuine. It feels like people go on dates just because everyone else is doing it. You ask eachother about work and family and try to decide if they would be a good partner in under a few hours. 

Instead of that I would like to become friends first but that feels difficult on an app such as tinder. I believe meeting friends of friends is a safer bet when wanting to meet someone and getting to know them in a non-forced setting. Sure there are other dating apps, but it's still a strange first encounter for a potential partner, for me at least.

Atm I will focus on being with friends and family, studying and maybe in a while someone interesting will pop up:)  Also, sorry for the rant. It would be interesting to know if anyone else feel the same!

629,ccm4gp,False,Other,40,"We were never supposed to meet, but it felt like we were destined to meet each other.",dating,"TL;DR
I (25M) met a great girl (21F) who happened to have the same school schedule as me and we walked together for a while. We started dating and spent a lot of time together. We expressed interest in each other, almost made it official, but she decided against long distance because she’s transferring to another school. She is a class act and was honest with me about what she was thinking and feeling. It’s hard wondering what might have been.



She (21F) returned to my (25M) university this semester after spending time abroad and is transferring to a school in a neighboring state. We live in the same apartment complex and I noticed that she walked to and from class the same days and times as me. One day I noticed her walking behind me and I slowed down to let her catch up to talk. She called out my name first and that led to several weeks walking and talking together.

I finally asked her out to dinner and I was surprised that she stayed in my car for almost two hours talking with me when I pulled up to her apartment after dinner. Our second date was a movie and she stayed in my car again for over an hour, but had to run in a bit early because she drank too much lemonade. We shared childhood stories, scars, and embarrassing moments over ice cream for our third date.

She told me about her favorite movies and that she hadn’t seen the sixth and final movie yet. I watched 1-5 over the next two days at work and we watched the sixth for our fourth date. I put my arm around her when the movie started and noticed that the tip of her thumb brushed mine a few times. Our fingers overlapped and interlocked as the movie went on. I asked her if she wanted to go stargazing and she immediately agreed.

Two days later I picked her up for our fifth date and found a spot in an open field. We barely missed the sunset, but we didn’t mind. We cozied up and ate snacks while we waited for the sky to turn black and used an app to find constellations. We saw dozens of satellites and wished on shooting stars. She laid her head on my chest and placed her hand over my heart the entire night. “When the Stars Go Blue” by Tim McGraw was playing when I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes, but sighed and said maybe because she is leaving soon. She was reluctant to go into a long distance relationship with such a new romance and wanted time to think, which I completely understand.

At one point I thought I heard her say that she loved me. I took two seconds to consider my feelings for her, and said that I loved her too. I quickly realized I misheard because she said that that was a lot to take in. Instead of backpedaling I said that I think about her, that I care about her, and more than anything I want her to be happy. What else is that except love? She seemed to appreciate my answer because she sighed and held me tighter.

I was not planning to kiss her, but she gradually came closer as the night went on, and soon our eyelashes were brushing. Then our noses nuzzled, and at that moment I knew she wanted to kiss me. I turned to face her and we were drawn to each other like magnets. We made out until 2:30 am and ran from sprinklers twice. We whispered sweet nothings all night, and she told me that she was happy that I treat her special. She confessed that her wish was that we would kiss. She said that she could easily fall asleep in my arms in that field. We agreed to continue seeing each other even though she hadn’t decided on doing long distance, and I assured her that I could go the distance. We kept saying that we had to go but we couldn’t stop kissing each other. We’d just laugh and keep kissing. I fell hard for her that night.

A day or two later I was back at her apartment to watch a movie. I came prepared with a note written in my best cursive, which I haven’t used since third grade, and I folded it into a little boat. I gave it to her after the movie and she loved the gesture. The note said, “Put two ships in the open sea, and, at last, they will come together.” We kissed again for hours and I confessed that she was very special to me, and pretty inside and out. She told me that I was special and amazing for being so good to her. I reminded her again that she could bet on me to go the distance and she said that she believed me.

Our seventh date was the Fourth of July. She wasn’t able to attend a barbecue earlier that day, but I was happy that she came with me to see fireworks. At this point the dread had been setting in for a couple days if it didn’t work, but also the excitement that it just might. We walked around holding hands exploring booths and stopped to listen to a live band. We met up with friends and cozied up for the fireworks. My friends left early to try and beat the crowds but we stayed to wait until everyone had left. We went back to my car because it started to rain and the fireworks continued.

We kissed until we were the last car left. I said that every time I kissed her was like the first time. We drove home holding hands the entire way singing along to every country song on the radio. I pulled up to her apartment at 1:25 am and we kissed goodbye until 3:00 am with the music still playing. She held me tighter than ever before and kissed me slower to stretch fleeting moments into eternity. I got the car door for her and we kissed a while longer in the rain. She didn’t mind because she was wearing my sweatshirt. Every time we kissed I would count to three to let her go, kiss her with each count, but could never let her go on three.

We planned on another movie and lunch the following Saturday but she forgot about homework and a family function. I stopped by her place and tried to talk her into getting a quick lunch, but she suggested another day. We planned on a movie for Monday night and I kissed her goodbye.

She called me Sunday night and asked me to go on a drive. It was either really bad news or really good news, but it felt like the former. Her face said everything when I got into her car. She said that she genuinely enjoyed our time together and appreciated me for being sweet and treating her special, but that the timing was bad because she was leaving in two weeks. She touched my hand and apologized, but I thanked her for her honesty and courage to tell me in person. I reminded her that everything I told her was still true; that she means a lot to me and is very special. I fought back tears but kept my composure until I could go on a drive alone to weep bitterly.

Our time together was brief but it will always be a cherished memory. I meant every word that I told her; that I care about her, and that she is beautiful inside and out. She is a sweetheart and deserves to be treated special. I wish that we could have been together under different circumstances.

This heartbreak hurts differently than the others because we both expressed interest in each other and wanted to be together. It hurts feeling so close to her but being so far. Pure love is selfless so I have resolved to let her go. I had hoped that our ships were destined to meet. I couldn’t help but consider the coincidences that brought us together and I wondered if this was the beginning of our story. It’s unlikely that we will meet again, but I desperately hope from the bottom of my heart that it’s not the end and that life will bring us together at last.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ccm4gp/we_were_never_supposed_to_meet_but_it_felt_like/,243,This may hurt but... it's not really that she has to go in too weeks.

631,9xbwzv,False,Giving Advice,52,"The best dating advice, based on my own experiences, that I'd like to share with you all",dating,"When I hit 29 last December, I realized I'd be 30 in a year, and took a moment to reflect on where I was in life. I was a little overweight (my weight had always been around 150, but I was closer to 160 I'm pretty sure), out of shape, unhappy with my job, and not particularly happy with my social/romantic life. I felt like I'd hit rock bottom in some ways. Then I decided I wanted to hit 30 the best I could

The first thing I focused on was running and fitness. I'd been running as a hobby for a few years, but this time I started actually following plans and watching what I eat. Whereas I used to run once or twice  a week, I was now running several times. I slowly got into the best shape/physique in my life, and where I was previously content to rank in the top 15 and my age group in races, I was now consistently challenging for the top 3 overall and easily topping my age group

The success from running started spilling over into other parts of life too. I started doing nofap, went on a huge streak of no porn and no masturbation, and felt my confidence go up even more. I started becoming more productive, both at home and at work, and my overall mood was markedly better every day. The highs were higher, and the lows weren't so bad

That's not to say everything was rosy. I injured my knee at the start of the summer and spent two months out and unable to run. This affected my mood and confidence A LOT, and nothing else really seemed to go right during that time frame, including my romantic life. But as soon as I was able to run again, I slowly worked my way back to where I was, and then worked even harder to achieve my goals. To give you some idea: my goal when I hit 29 was to run a 5K in under 20 minutes. I've done that several times over already, and I'm now a little over a month away from turning 30, and my next race will see me run a 5K in under 19

The point of all this, and my advice to you all, is that success begets success. If you can find something you're good at (a sport, a hobby, your job, anything), and work hard to get even better, that success will spill over into other aspects of your life. I've focused on running, which has brought a ton of benefits with it: other than keeping me in top shape, it doubles as a form of meditation. As someone who has struggled (and still occasionally does) with anxiety, running helps relieve a lot of it. It also gives me alone time to focus on my problems and find solutions

I've gotten checked out and have flirted with more girls in the past month than I ever have. I've actually had the confidence to turn down cute girls because I just wasn't interested (the old me wouldn't have done that, because old me would have been desperate). Again, has everything been perfect? Of course not. I asked out a girl this past weekend, only to find out she has a boyfriend. It stung, because I'd thought she was cute for a while and finally got the courage to ask her out. But you know what else? I realized I could either view myself as a guy who got turned down by his crush, or as the guy who won two trophies and top spot at his 5K the very same day

That's success, and confidence, do to you. Every day I tell myself I want to be a champion, and I ask myself, ""What would a champion do in this situation?"". In this specific case, a champion would take the L, keep working hard and improving, and continue winning. This girl didn't work out, so what? If I keep grinding, someone else will see that and appreciate it. But if I give up and let myself fall off, everything will get more difficult. People like others who are successful and confident; they don't like people who lose and are insecure (and note, losing =/= failing. Failing means you made a mistake but got back up to do better. Losing means you gave up)

I'll say it again for you: success breeds success. Find something you enjoy doing, whether it's running, writing, DND, whatever, and get good at it. Then start spreading that success to other areas of your life, and you'll find dating to be easier. It's not a guarantee that you'll be getting dates or you'll find ""the one"", but it is a guarantee that you'll feel better about yourself and will be able to roll with the punches better

Please see original post for the story on this.

So I (25F) asked him (37M) to be exclusive a little less than two months ago. He said yes and things were great. Over this period of time we’ve texted a lot and made a ton of effort to see each other. We actually just got back from the Hamptons this weekend. 

Well this morning after we had sex he got in the shower and left his phone unlocked. I really didn’t want to look at it but I was honestly a little suspicious but wanted to rest my nerves by hoping to see nothing. But I was wrong. Still on bumble. Texting a few other women. Even was making plans to meet up with one for a drink TONIGHT. My god I was and still am so fucking upset. I know I had to confront him.

So we’re walking to his work and I just hit him with “you know what, I really don’t like being lied to” and he said “about what?” then I said “remember when I asked to be exclusive a month and a half ago and you said yes? Why did you lie?” he then tries to put the blame on me and says “well you asked me that out of nowhere and I felt pressured to say yes” OHHHHH MY GOD what a big load of shit. I told him that if that was the case why didn’t he bring it up AT ALL within the last month and a half. He didn’t really give me an answer and just said he can’t do this right now because he’s late for work. Then I just said “whatever” and walked the fuck away. Haven’t heard from him since. 

He’s just so shocked he got caught being a shitty ass person.

We shortly moved over to fb messenger after and have been messaging for just over a month.

We finally met on Monday and had a great first date- he actually picked me up to drive me to a job interview and waited in the car while I was at it- then he drove and toured me around the city near where we live (I recently moved to where he lives hence the one month of just messaging), then we went out for a nice lunch. He paid for lunch but I paid for the ice cream after, which was also delicious. After that, we toured around some more before going back to his place and playing video games for a while before my mom asked me to come home for dinner. 

Originally we had plans to play soccer in the evening the next day but he asked if I was down to spend the day with him tomorrow in the city we were going to play soccer in. So he picked me up right in the morning and off we went. We had breakfast and lunch together, went shopping, even met his grandma and toured around the city a bit with her. He also took me to an arcade which was fun too! We went back to his house and played more video games before heading out to play soccer, and then he drove me home in the evening. 
It was two of the best dates I have ever had! I was beaming all day! He even texted me after to say he had a great time too ☺️

636,cyoh7v,False,I Need Advice,85,I (25m) seem to only attract girls with anxiety/depression and it kind of weirds me out.,dating,"I've been in a few relationships before (all lasting a few months, all fun, and all ended by circumstances outside my control). They've all been great, I've learned a lot about dating and about myself, but (and I know this is shallow)- every girl I've dated has a history of anxiety and/or depression that began before I met them, and which I've found out about AFTER we start dating. 

&#x200B;

I know that I'm a confident, empathetic person who gives a lot in relationships and is comfortable with vulnerability, but it seems like the only people who are attracted to me are women looking for that emotional stability, who then latch onto me right away. I don't regret any of my past relationships, and I enjoy being an emotional rock. However, I feel guilty when I share my own problems or concerns with my dating partners because I feel like its unfair to make them listen to/help me with my problems when they have so much else they're worried about. I've genuinely cared about and trusted the women I've dated, but I sometimes find myself holding back, if that makes sense. Now I'm a PhD student and I have an insanely busy schedule, so I can't give as much as I'm used to, which makes me worried about dating someone with anxiety. 

&#x200B;

Have you noticed differences when you were dating people with and without anxiety? What were those differences?

Back story: My ex and I dated on and off for 5 years. We had a cute start-up story. We both worked in a King Soopers. I was his barista and he was my banker. I asked HIM out on a date. (Trophy points for me). I loved him with everything I had and he was my world. He was my first real love and I cared for him deeper than I ever cared for anyone. Throughout our relationship, I chose not to see how he was mentally and emotionally abusive to me so much so that I completely lost my confidence and who I was as a person. Manipulation really puts a toll on the soul. He officially left me 2 months ago leaving me feeling like everything was my fault while I was already going through a very dark time in my life.

Rejection is one of my biggest fears. Despite this, I walked right up to him and asked him out (shaking but tried to portray confidence)... verdict is, he said, ""of course"". 

People of Reddit: Ask him/her out! Take the leap. Find that courage. Remember you are worth alot, and if the other person cant see that, it's alright!

643,exzcsm,False,Tinder/Online Dating,105,Dating App idea!,dating,"My idea for a dating app (pardon if this is dumb but I'm bored and drinking). You basically log in, create an account and then have to decide if you're looking for something casual or serious right at the start. This creates two separate groups of people and can only be switched by requesting which requires the user to fill out a form. This I think will make the process of switching tedious enough to stop people from toggling back in forth to take advantage of both groups.

Anyways, the profile has required fields. These fields include things such as a 3 picture minimum (at least 2/3 has to be ONLY you and you have to be visible), age, height, gender, career, education and two text boxes - one for a brief introduction and then the second for hobbies/interests. These text boxes will have a minimum requirement.

Here's where I think it gets unique. All conversation is live. You must both be online at the same time to chat. You only see users online at the time you are and these users are in the form of little icons you can click on to view. You basically go through and mark yes or no that you would like to talk to them and it will mark any users that want to talk to you in green on your screen so you know! If you match with them then you both get a notification saying that you want to talk to each other. Once you mark someone as a no they will disappear from your list so you can't see that they are online but you can go to another screen that let's you see everyone you've said no to and basically check any you want to undo.

If you both say yes to the notification to talk, you're brought into a chat room where you get questions based on if you're looking for something casual or serious. It is a specific number of questions like maybe 5-10 and it changes each time. Then you just share your answers and at the end you get to choose if you'd like to keep talking to them. If at any point you decide you aren't fond of the person you can exit the chat and then they get sent to your ""rejected"" group unless you go uncheck them. If you make it through though and both want to keep talking than you get your own chat where you don't have to be on at the same time and can exchange numbers/meet up or whatever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/exzcsm/dating_app_idea/,233,"I quit my job and spent the last 12 months building pretty much this.

644,bumz1j,False,Venting,151,Realizing you're the problem,dating,"Hey r/dating. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this rant.

I haven't had a second date in six months. I'm a somewhat conventionally attractive woman, take care of myself, etc. and on dating apps, I get tons of matches pretty easily, and even sometimes in public or when I'm out with my friends, I'm approached and asked for my number. However, it's after someone meets me in person for a date that things tend to go south and I get politely rejected or ghosted.

The pattern tends to go as follows; I match with someone, they seem super interested, we talk for a couple days on the app or via text, one of us asks to meet up in person (I like to take the initiative sometimes and am fairy confident), the date goes okay/good in my opinion, but then I either never hear from them again, or when I try to reach out, I get a polite message indicating they are not interested in seeing me again.

And if this clarifies, some of them I slept with after, some I didn't. 

So, I've come to the conclusion that while I consider myself attractive and have no issues getting interest/matches from people, I have some seriously blaring personality flaws that are really turning the people I'm going out with off. After the same exact pattern happening so many times, it's pretty clear that I am the problem.

I think for one I talk about myself too much, I know that for sure. And I have a tendency to overshare. And maybe I'm not asking my dates enough questions. Or, maybe I'm drinking too much on the dates bars. Or maybe I look better in my pictures than in real life?  I'm trying to figure it out and work on it so I can be better at dating and finally get past the first date.

Anyway, rant over. I guess I'm glad I'm self aware enough to see the pattern, but it still sucks to be rejected so many times and feel like there's something seriously wrong with me. I have tons of friends I'm close with and I get along with my coworkers, but for whatever reason I guess I'm not bringing the qualities that make me likable in other situations into my dates.

There’s this guy I met a few months back that I’d see almost daily. We’d chat and we got to know each other. I thought “hey I like this guy” so I asked him if I could give him my number. He said yes. We texted for a bit and then a few days later he stops texting me and I don’t see him around. Over a week and a half later he pops up out of nowhere and sends me a text. 

Also this past Friday I was supposed to go on a date with some other guy and he didn’t follow through because “he got distracted by his friends”. I told him it was okay and that if he doesn’t want to go on a date that it is fine but also tell me what you want. I got no response.

I know these are minor things and it’s not a big issue. It’s just frustrating when I hear all the time that guys appreciate an upfront girl but whenever I’m upfront with guys I feel like I scare them away. 

I talked to a friend about this and he said it might be because I’m intimidating, but I’m a tiny gal. I feel like I don’t look that intimidating.

I wouldn't believe for one second that you're actually interested, even if you say you do and give me your number. My first gut reaction would be ""This chick wants something from me, or thinks I'm gonna be an easy target for some free dinner dates. Or she's planning to fuck my life up."" 

If you're even half as tiny as you claim to be, it'll be real easy to convince people that you're a rape victim.

That no matter how long they spend on these apps or how many times they tweak their profile or opener that they can't seem to connect with anyone in a meaningful way. Here's why.

Online dating (apps, sites) isn't really dating. It's really just a way to set up meetings between people. Your profile, at the end of the day, is more like a marketing brochure than an actual representation of who you are. Without developing the skills needed to be emotionally in tune with others (particularly strangers), you will find yourself consistently struggling to attract people into your life long term. How does one develop those skills?

By engaging in social activities that create regular social circles where there are people who consistently show up and new people constantly rotating in. Learning how to make friends with strangers is the first step, learning how to gauge signs of interest through invitations and physical escalation rounds out the process. 

Spend less time working on your profile and more time working on your relationships with real humans, and your dating pool and options will flourish.

My advice, go for a good guy who earns 1.5 or twice of you, who has drive and ambition and is passionate about stuff. Don't be desperate.

You can literally have everything going for you and get absolutely nowhere these days with dating and I think a lot of it has to do with the apps. They're successful precisely because they don't work most of the time, and are specifically designed to keep you on them so they can monetize off your frustration. They're making everyone flaky, indecisive, and non-committal due to the illusion of choice, but they're not entirely to blame, and thats the remaining piece of the puzzle I'm trying to figure out - do I have a character flaw I'm unaware of? If so, nobody has given me any insight as to what it is..

I have never had a problem with women my entire life before my last LTR ended in the beginning of 2016, and I have WAY more to offer now than I ever did in the past. When I got out of that relationship apps were the go-to and I've only had intermittent success with them since. Here's the typical pattern for me; Match with someone, meetup, things appear to be going well, then we talk for 2-3 weeks, possibly meetup a second time etc and then....crickets, OR they convey that there's no 'spark' or aren't 'feeling it'. I'm sure that may be partially true, but not the entire reason for them losing interest. It's just crazy how everyone is trying to judge or replace you before they even give themselves a chance to get to know you, but I guess these are the rules that are in place in the throw-away society we now live in.

This is going to sound like a humble brag but its just me being objective about my situation - I'm a handsome guy (so I'm told) I workout regularly, have a great career making DAMN good money, good credit, a house, a dog. I've got my life together. I'm respectful, educated, driven, introspective, multifaceted, emotionally relevant, not clingy, and I take care of myself.  I've got a satirical / nihilistic sense of humor and I'm decently witty, but I'm also kind of chill and introverted. I've dated, been in LTRs, and FWB type situations with drop dead gorgeous women so I know what I'm capable of, but man it's just been really confusing lately as to why I'm not having any luck. I recently started dating women with kids which I no longer see an issue with given my age, but no luck with them either....what. is. happening?

He sent a text out of no where asking to slow things down and I told him to call me. We talked for 40 minutes. He wanted to let it organically become a more serious relationship. He thought I was pushing for something serious too fast. In reality I knew we could never be a serious thing, so I was giving him what I thought he wanted. He was definitely confused, as I kept insisting we never had a chance at being serious. He would repeat ""never say never"" and I would respond with ""no, you don't understand it can't work."" I ended it with goodnight and goodbye.

I thought I could date just anyone. I thought it didn't matter if he didn't have his life together (we are 23 who has their life together?), but it was more than that. He wasn't motivated by anything and had no passion in life. He hated his job (bartending) and kept talking about all these crazy next steps. I tried helping him and I wanted to give advice but, I'm in a very different place.

I have my bachelors. I'm currently finishing up my masters degree. I'm looking for PhD programs for the next 4 years... I was stringing him along because I was having fun but I knew that his directionless life was a major red flag for me. I want something serious, but I (edit: realized I) didn't want anything serious with him.

\^\^(Edit: these were the realizations I made after the fact. Not things I was purposely doing. **I didn't purposely string him along because I wanted fun. I thought I really wanted to be with him.** But once we talked it out i became aware what i was doing and the harm it would cause if continued).

672,gixzh5,False,Other,92,Opinion: We're facing a generation of singles,dating,"Presenting my points as to why in the next decades, I believe that more and more people in the current young generation born 1990-2000+ will be single and unmarried in their 40s and 30s:

1. **Overchoice:** Scratching the 8 billion humans mark, you can just pull out tinder and get a pool of choices, compare and pick from any of them. There's just so many! Overchoice tricks us into not compromising. There's so much of 'the good stuff', *surely* you don't need to sacrifice your requirements, and there's always more fish in the sea, no bother fighting for a relationship!
2. **Social Media and Porn:** I've put these two in the same category. They both distort our view of potential partners, and over-sexualise our ideas of relationships. Important as well, they higher our standards. Your girl next door is neither an instagram model, or just your sweet sexual release. And a relationship is much more than something sexual, sexual attraction or infatuation, but we don't seem to think so these days.
3. **Mental Health:** This comes in with less force than the first two, but it also holds some weight to it. We are all notoriously depressed, it's a XXI century thing at this point. Instant gratification, addictions (to food, to social media, to youtube), porn, technology... they can be no good. But for whatever reasons you want, our declining mental health as a society is complicating relationships, turning them unhealthy and painful.

And for the above reasons, I believe our generation is doing quite a crappy job at dating, and many will enter their 30s quite single as a  △ .

I have a variety of photos that at least I think look good and show off my personality. I used to have a good bio that showed off what my interests are and gave a lot of points for someone to start a conversation with. Then I had people tell me I put too much in my bio and it should be short and succinct - fine, I’ve done that. I try to show genuine interest when I get a match, because I hate it when I talk to someone with the personality of a plank. I try to move things along to a physical date as soon as possible but then things fizzle out. I used to live in a really small town so I’ve moved to Chicago since then, partially for a larger dating pool but mostly to advance my own interests. 

I thought things would be better since I moved, considering it has like 200x the population density. But I hardly get any matches, maybe one a week, and on bumble only one person of 5 has actually sent a message so I couldn’t even talk to 4 of them. And when I do get a match most of the time they seem so bored and disinterested.

I want to date people I meet in real life but I do *not* want to be seen as a creep. All I ever hear are women saying they get approached too often. I don’t want to disturb anyone at a cafe or something, especially if they have headphones in. At bars, nearly all women are with friends and I tend to go alone, and so that’s a no-go. 

I’m starting improv classes soon so I’m hoping that will help, but still I feel like I’m missing out on a lot in life, and I get so frustrated when people talk about how easy it was for them to find a SO or how many dates they go on. Like, how?!

&#x200B;

1. it puts average looking men at a severe disadvantage. I’ve spent so much time and effort into tinder and bumble, getting the perfect pictures, sending a ton of messages, swiping right on everyone, etc. fucking nothing. it’s wrecked my self esteem, and it makes me resent those who effortlessly match with dozens of people
2. if you’re and awkward texter, you’re completely fucked. there’s an immense amount of pressure to be charming, funny, etc etc when you start texting your match, and if you’re not, you’ll never get anywhere.
3. it’s allowed women to not have to even set foot out of their homes to find tons of men to date. that’s taken away the impetus for many women to actually go out and meet men in real life.

&#x200B;

I moved to a new city about 6 months ago. I’ve wanted a relationship desperately since I’ve been here, and I’ve tried it all. I’ve spent months swiping on tinder and bumble. total failure. I’ve tried approaching girls whenever I’m out and about, got lots of numbers, but in the end that was a total failure too.

&#x200B;

I also spend a substantial amount of time going to MeetUp events to meet girls. I try to put myself out there and meet as many people as possible, in the hopes that one day I will come across a nice girl who I can pursue. as it turns out, the gender ratio at the vast majority of these events is about 75 men 25 women, and of those women, maybe half are my age.

&#x200B;

to me, it seems that the age of online dating has made the dating world as a whole more isolating and emotionally crushing for average looking men. I’m so fucking frustrated sexually and emotionally I have a hard time thinking straight sometimes. I don’t have money, so those singles meetups in bars are out of reach for me. anything that costs money is out of the question.

&#x200B;

and yet here I am, back on tinder and bumble. why? because apparently that’s one of the only fucking ways to meet girls. I hate it, but I feel like I don’t have a choice.

678,c2gnmd,False,Giving Advice,27,Overthinking In Dating,dating,"This is simply one perspective on an all too common issue that both men and women face in the search for love and connection. When we are looking for love, or someone to love us, our ego often sticks its head out and creates false realities that override what is actually going on around you, in my experience at least and maybe yours too. For instance, at one point I would overthink things so badly that I had simply sent a cute baby animal picture to a girl I had been dating for some time and the result that my overthinking mind came to was that she would either break up with me when she replied or that she would simply stop talking to me. In reality, she was having a terrible day as it just so happened to be the anniversary of her father's death and seeing her favorite baby animal made her day. That text also made us closer as she shared her emotions and about the intimate issues that she suffered from with the loss of her father.

Then again later with this same women, she canceled on one date after never having canceled before and my overthinking mind concluded that she no longer loved me. We spoke for a bit and apparently she had a small procedure and she had some extra swelling. Again, my overthinking mind concluded that this must not be the real issue and the real issue is that she no longer loves me and that I am unlovable although I never let this show. She went on to tell me she really wanted to see me and wanted to see me as soon as she could which didn't settle my mind until I had a two simple realizations.

1. The first realization is that our universe is complete and utter chaos but it only feels chaotic when we fight the true chaos of reality. Take a monk for instance. To truly be a Buhdist monk is to simply be and accept the world as it is and they are at peace. Take for instance the other end of the spectrum the Wall Street stock trader constantly racing to change their life, earn more money and get that next sale constantly filled with stress and anxiety which is the simple truth of not accepting the current state of life and the chaos of life. When you embrace and give in to the chaos and the fact that you really cannot control the world, peace and serenity will come to you and overthinking is nullified.
2. The second is that in order to build a healthy relationship, the basis should be trust and honesty which is not what I was doing. I was not trusting fully when she told me that the reason she wanted to cancel was that she had massive swelling and was too uncomfortable to go on a date. She has never lied to me or be honest up until now and so I have no reason to not believe her but my mind would race to look for the reason behind the reason which was my subconscious trying to find a reason to back up a limiting belief that I have had for some time that ""I am unlovable"" which is false as she very obviously loves me but that limiting belief wanted me to not trust her as it did not match that limiting, false, belief.

Whether it is people having trouble getting anyone to initially notice them, getting a second date, or ghosting them. They come on here and vent their frustration and usually are met with good advice from people who are genuinely trying to help. Some people suggest working out to build self confidence.

Be more open. Wait to text back...... the list of advice goes on and the complaints of rejection keep coming.  
To the point. It's great that the people having issues are looking to better yourself. But... oh yes always a but.  
The common theme I see with all the people having these issues is definitely not lack of effort. It is the fact that people are trying to take this advice and change their habits to attract the interest of others. Absolutely the wrong reason to make a lifestyle change. And it will absolutely lead to more rejection and more bitterness.

They know who they are and they are true to themselves. Now I'm not saying be an asshole... I am saying dont change who you are for the sake of someone else, ever. 
If you want to change yourself because you dont like something about yourself, have at it. But the second you compromise your values for the sake of someone else, I can guarantee people sense that, and they sense it as a weakness, and it's not an attractive one.

681,cz298d,False,None,69,"If dating makes you upset, you should focus on youself.",dating,"TLDR; 

When you enjoy your life enough to be happy while alone, then you become selective. If you find yourself in a hurry to date someone, you should figure out where that internal dependency comes from as it isn't healthy. Anyone can be happy with themselves, you just have to learn. For women afraid of wasting their biological ""clock"": It would seem very selfish to your kids to be in a possibly unhappy relationship just to birth said children.

Long version:

Oh I can smell the hate coming... When I'm on tinder I get a decent amount of matches, probably around 1 match in 5 swipes. But I only swipe out of bordom. I don't swipe just to swipe, but more for finding someone unconventionally attractive. Im the type who doesn't like to date ""hot"" crowd but more along the lines of ""beautiful"". The problem is that my deffinition of beautiful is defined by a feeling I get, almost a love at true site feeling. I've felt it twice my entire life so I know I can find it again.

Now some may say I have high standards, but im happy with my single life. I can hear the angry reditors calling me ""lucky"" or explaing how ""you'de never understand"" but this should apply to everyone. Im in no hurry to get in a relationship. I enjoy college (the studying part-I dont party) and I'm always so busy with activities and self improvment that being alone isnt lonely. So for me its not a standard but more of a ""I have plenty of time to find the right one"" so I don't rush and thus.. I swipe (:

Tinderies message me first all the time asking to go out and we'll do just that. Ive been ghosted (ive never ghosted a soul) ive been told they weren't interested, ive even been preassures/tricked into one night stands (no ones fault but my own). I dont take it personally as ultimately I wouldnt wanna date someone not interested in me anyways. 

Everyone is so upset with online dating not because its bad but because it doesn't fall into their own narrative. Most people on here (not all, but most) only get upset at online dating because they're in a hurry to find someone. When you're happy with yourself and you love yourself, dating isn't a priority and when it isnt a priority you become more successful in your dating life. Its an oximoron, sure, but I find that men can sence desperate woman so they take advantage, and women can sence desperate men so they run.

Dating should be taken slow, it should be done in different ways: online, in person, out at parties, etc.. When you live in a world where selectivity and choice is easy, you should be able to take advantage of it without feeling bad for those you selected against. If you're a guy who is upset because you got a match but no message, its your choice to take it personally and hurt your ego. I don't advicate ghosting or trying to hurt someone, but at the end of the day everyone needs a frame and a barrier to fill that frame.

I wasn't always happy being alone. I was raised by a single mother who dated several men as I grew up, each more abusive than the last. Her dependency issues rubbed off onto me and I always belived I had to date someone to be happy (sure these issues went way beyind that). But honestly, I taught myself that I can be dependent on myself. I can be so happy with my own accomplishments that I may as well be another person. The best thing is, this drives you to accomplish more! Now I hear more reditors calling me ""self-absorbed"" a ""narcasist"", but do we really live in a world where truly being happy with who you are is boiled down to selfish-self love by those who havn't felt it?

684,aob6xa,False,Giving Advice,161,"We’re approaching the 20’s, and quite frankly the current (western) dating culture is toxic as hell.",dating,"Point blank, with the proliferation of social media and online dating men have debased themselves for womens’ attention and affection so much online that it’s now having real world consequences. Women have stopped respecting men, and men have stopped respecting themselves when it comes to dating. Therefore, due to women being put on a pedestal by men they’ve become entitled and egotistical. Conversely, men have become so labeled and heaped with promiscuous expectations that they are shamed for not being able to find/have sex or a partner while also being shames for trying *too hard** to have/find sex.

Stop. This subreddit is absolutely filled with borderline cringeworthy posts of (mostly men but some women) lamenting their single, lonely lives, but I have this to say:

Fellas, respect yourselves. Don’t let immature, self-obsessed women disrespect you are cast you aside. If a girl friendzones you, don’t stick around. Find other options and better friends. Don’t be an emotional masochist nor an emotional tampon to girls who have no interest in either sleeping with you or being with you. She isn’t worth your time.

Ladies, respect yourselves too. Don’t let bummy ass dudes waste your time or attention, and be upfront and honest with men who you *know* are interested in you even if you’re afraid of “hurting their feelings”. Rejection hurts, but leading men on hurts more. Y’all have zero excuses, and if a guy can’t take no for an answer then, I dunno, report him to police instead of entertaining this weirdo? 

Seriously... I wasn’t sure whether to flair this as a rant or as advice so I chose the latter; however, y’all need to get your act together. Respect in a relationship, platonic or romantic, is the top priority, and if people don’t respect your time, attention, or presence then cut them out of your life. 

Peace <3

Ghosting leaves individuals without a sense of closure. Closure, as we might know from personal experience, is incredibly important to many of us! When we are ghosted, we leave even the most casual encounters with a sense of unease and, perhaps, the tiniest bit of what feels like grief. 

I have been working on ending mismatches or flings I have met in person with simple sentences. My most general is, “I don’t feel this is a match.” Generally, it goes over well. Yes, I do have a fear someone will cling and make promises they cannot possibly keep. This is where my boundary setting skills get tested and I repeat that this isn’t a good match and wouldn’t work. 

I try not to bring up any personal things- sometimes it has nothing to do with who the person is, but rather who I am as a person. We’re all trying to find matches, and just because one doesn’t work out doesn’t meant there’s anything wrong with either. It’s simply not a good match. ANYWAYS I got off topic.

My last relationship (five years ago) ended in a trainwreck. She cheated on me. I had some pretty deep wounds from it and my love live absolutely suffered.

Ever since I was younger, like dating in high school, I realized I romanticized things and attached easy. It caused a lot of toxic relationships. 

When I finally made it on my own in the world and moved away from home, I realized that many factors in my life, including abuse from my mother when I was a child (she is NPD and BPD), have caused me to develop an anxious attachment style — in every type of relationship in my life, including friendships, family and casual things. 

When I first meet someone, I’m chill. They tell me how respectful, genuine and relaxed I am, and they like me because I respect their boundaries... until I don’t and sabotage. 

Most of the time, I push away and ghost, but other times, I become this ridiculous person, insecure and emotional, over the tiniest emotional spark. If I have a NSA hook up with someone, I’m someone else, this calm, collected, cool, mysterious, fascinating person. But then the moment we find we have a lot in common or we vibe well, I start to feel vulnerable and it makes me act like a lunatic. 

It’s really embarrassing and it’s not me. Over years of therapy and medication, thankfully I’ve overcome a lot of self esteem issues, depression and PTSD, but I’ve noticed there are some remnants of anxiety and insecurities I am having trouble overcoming. 

All of my past boyfriends have cheated on me or abused me, and I feel this has torn me apart emotionally. I don’t want to be insecure. 

I mean, my life is insane. I work, I have several hobbies, I have things keeping me busy, and yet I fall into this awful behavior that makes me look bored, desperate and needy. 

I need to kick this crap to the curb, because I’ve met some really awesome people lately, but I can’t seem to “go with the flow” or “take it slow,” and I give off this vibe in the beginning that I’m pretty cool with all of that, and then turn into this over dramatic person. Texting too much, calling too much, overthinking every interaction. Wondering if they even like me. 

It’s so unattractive and embarrassing. 

I have to talk myself through everything, telling myself to chill, that they’re human and this isn’t even a thing yet, and I’m going to ruin it if I don’t shut up and go with the flow like I should. 

I hate to be a walking red flag. I hate knowing at any moment I’ll sabotage something good (before it even begins at times) because of this.

I’ve been dating this girl for two months now, and everything was going really well. On Thursday I helped her pack her car to get home, and we promised that we would try and see each other over break. The town that we go to school at is halfway between where we each live, so it was definitely in the realm of possibility.

We had been texting since break started and talked on the phone Sunday night when she got home from work. I woke up late yesterday (around 11) and sent her a good morning text. She didn’t text me back because she had work, and had been busy all through the weekend, and I didn’t think much of it. Eventually it got to be evening with no reply, and then almost midnight, so I sent her another text saying goodnight and went to bed.

I woke up at 5am to find a text about how even though she liked me, and that we had talked about our relationship, that she wanted to break things off, and wanted more ‘autonomy,’ and that she’s ‘just not feeling it’. I honestly don’t know what to feel. I thought things were going great, but obviously they weren’t, and now I’m lying in bed typing this up wide awake.

I've been single my entire life and at 25 years old I am starting to become afraid, afraid at the very possibility that I'll be alone forever and never find anyone. Everyone always says to be positive, focus on yourself, it'll happen when it happens, but I'm starting to believe thats just something people say to make you feel better so you don't lose hope.

I remember seeing a therapist when I was 20 and about to enter my junior year of college and we talked a lot about this. He told me ""It'll happen when its meant to happen."" 5 years later and it still hasn't happened. Not for lack of trying either, I hang out with friends, go out whenever I'm invited somewhere, been on every dating site/app for the past 5 years, joined sports clubs to meet new people, and it still hasn't gotten me anywhere. Now I'm just at a loss on what to do and I'm staring to worry, like really worry.

I've gotten some dates the past two years from online dating, but almost all of them ended after the first date and It takes months of swiping, liking, and messaging girls to even get the slightest prospect of a date. The most recent girl I went out with that I met online, we dated for a month and I thought I was finally gonna get laid, I was almost positive I would. But she had just gotten out of a relationship and wasn't ready to have sex yet, and I respected that so we held off. A few weeks later she ended things. That was almost 2 months ago and I haven't had any prospects since. 

Every person I know who has or had a girlfriend (Which at my age, is pretty much everybody) has met their girl at school, work, or through friends. None of these have worked for me. I'm no longer in school, I don't work with any girls at my job, and my friends don't introduce me to any girls. After college I joined a bunch of coed sports leagues hoping to meet some people, maybe a girl, but nothing has really happened with that. I'm starting to look at other options like volunteering or joining a class, but I feel the odds of actually meeting a girl there who is single, my age, and we're both attracted to each other is incredibly slim. I also don't want to join something for the wrong reasons. 

I try to look at the bright side of it all everyday, but it is just so hard sometimes. I know I have to do something different, but I don't want to cold approach strangers or join a group I have no interest in. Like, just last night I wanted to go out in the city with my friends and maybe talk to some girls, but none of them wanted to do anything but sit inside, play video games, drink and smoke weed, so I had to just stay in with them. So that is just another lost opportunity lost. Pretty soon the work week will start again and unless I want to bother people at the grocery store or gym I won't be meeting any girls. 

Sorry for the long post, I've had a lot on my mind and just needed to get it out. If anyone has had a similar problem and got out of it I would love to hear how you did it. And I'm still currently seeing a therapist (A different one), as well as meditating and trying to be mindful of my thoughts whenever I start to think negative. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cihcu0/feel_like_i_wont_ever_find_someone_i_dont_know/,205,"1) ""  starting to become afraid, afraid at the very possibility that I'll be alone forever and never find anyone ""

DON'T. You're afraid --> you'll panic and say stupid things on that first date

2) ""  I also don't want to join something for the wrong reasons. ""

Doesn't really sound like you're all  too afraid to be desperate enough to date for ""the wrong reasons""

3)  "" the odds of actually meeting a girl there who is single, my age, and we're both attracted to each other is incredibly slim ""

Why exactly does she have to be your age ? Have you seen that ""old"" man date a way much younger women , some of them work just fine.

Hoping that someday you'll find that 100% match relationship (just like those good looking men/women with parents that throws money at them that resulted in them being social and having more experience with dating and knowledge of social dating related stuff ,, and also with other genetics ((brains/aesthethic))  that lead to them being more romantically/sexually capable of getting more options ) is a pretty damn difficult goal to achieve.

This isn’t a post asking about what I should do because I know things take time and I’ll have to be patient. What I’m struggling with is the loneliness. I also know how to deal with the loneliness, i.e. have a hobby, find things to do, etc. and I’ve been doing all those as well. 

But the loneliness I’m talking about is one that you can’t shake off no matter how much concentration you’re putting into whatever you’re doing. It’s the kind of loneliness that makes you wish you had someone to text with all day. The kind of loneliness that makes you hate that the only notifications you receive are emails and social media. The kind that creeps back in after you’ve had a good time with friends or finished a good game session. 

This same loneliness is also felt back home because I have a very typical asian family where we don’t talk about things and show our feelings. So I’ve never felt homesick and am actually very happy to be away from home.

He started telling me about his life, which I didn’t have much of a problem with on its own—I seem to have a face that screams “Unload your troubles and tell me your life story”, so I’m long-accustomed to this sort of thing and open to it. He told me about his brother’s death, which I was very sorry to hear about. I expressed my condolences, and we began talking about grief. Trying to contribute to the conversation, I told him about losing my dad at a young age. He basically told me that we’re meant to lose our parents and that losing a sibling was worse. I honestly didn’t know what to say to that. Don’t get me wrong, I feel horrible that he lost his brother. But it’s not the damn Grief Olympics. Looking back, he hadn’t even said so much as “Sorry for your loss”. 

It only went downhill from there as I found out we were mutual friends with somebody very close to me, and when I brought it up, he started absolutely trashing this friend (who was thankfully not present). I tried to get in a positive word about my friend edgewise, but he prattled on. At this point, I was thinking “Fuck this”. 

Later that night, he asked me what my plans were. Unsure of what exactly about, I began telling him about the school I am attending. He became impatient and irritated, and clarified that he meant my plan for the night. When I apologized, politely telling him that I was going back with my friend, his entire face darkened and he began huffing a little, shifting in his seat and rolling his eyes angrily.

The best relationship material for women is NOT the ""ideal man"", it's another woman Why? - Because women have the same qualities each other look for in a partner. Both have the same interests, passion and hobbies. They understand and relate better with each other. Observe how women are with their female friends, they bond naturally and get along so well like you'd think they are in a relationship except without the sex component. Take a look at women who date women and see how good their relationships are, it certainly makes straight women envious. straight women only seem to get off by their dildos and lesbian porn.

You have people who will upload a photo of a lake and try to get around the photo filter.  a photo without you in it is still considered not having a photo.  If you have no desire to upload a photo of yourself on your profile then online dating is not for you and you should just delete your profile.  No one joins online dating to not see who they are talking to.  95% of people who refuse to put a photo of themselves on their profile are almost always in a relationship and cheating or are married and cheating.

I am not here to crap on people or put people down.  I am here to give good advice to people to help them be able to find their life partner.  I want people to feel happy and be happy.  I know how hard it is to feel hopeless and alone, as I myself have felt like that.  Once I decided to change the way I think about online dating I was able to find someone great and it worked out.  Any one of you in here can truly find someone great as long as you are not negative about yourself and you put photos up of what you actually look like.  I know it is hard to here but it works.  Some of you are just so hell bent on the fact that it is not gonna work and you are being so negative, which is probably why you are not having luck finding someone for yourself.  If you just be a little more confident in yourself you will find someone.  If you are not at all happy with yourself and how you look then you should take a step back from online dating and work on yourself until you are at least a good portion of the way happy with yourself.  If you are going to continue to go down a negative path and shoot down anyone trying to give you helpful advice then you are going to have a hard time trying to find someone.  I take it the people in this post with such negativity in their comments have deep rooted issues with themselves and their family members.  You also seem to possibly have deep rooted issues with someone in your past that has hurt you.

The basic idea behind all of these is that you should do thoughtful things you would've done for your ex, but now just do it for strangers/people you care about.  Some examples:

1. Randomly bought my roommate fudge and ice cream when he had a bad day.
2. Gifted flowers to some of my girl neighbors, with a note wishing them a great day.
3. Took myself and/or a friend on a date.  I personally like smoothie dates.
4. Danced to my favorite music in my room. Rediscovered old songs, discovered new ones.
5. Volunteered. I started doing manicures for old people at a retirement home.  I've never done or had a manicure in my life. It's been a fun learning process haha.
6. Worked out.  I'm already a pretty fit guy, but now that I have the extra motivation you can bet I'm gonna be setting some new PRs.
7. Dove even deeper into hobbies.  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and music production have been saving my ass.

Since 2013, I've tried to put myself out there (I.E. OkCupid); nothing ever came of it. Over the successive years, if there is an app, I probably used it. In all that time only four first dates, with nothing after. Last year I decided to take a hiatus from the apps.    
    
Being a regular at a local gym, another regular decided to play matchmaker and introduced me to a mutual friend last Monday. It was non-stop texting until last Thursday (went out to diner) then radio silence. Taking the higher ground I sent a follow-up on Saturday with no response. I only found out from the mutual friend the ""nice guy"" excuse. I would have accepted hearing it from her directly instead of acting immature and avoiding it (We're adults here).   
    
Taking a stab at the apps again, by god they all look the same and quite frankly boring and unoriginal. Within minutes I uninstalled.

So I just realised today , that perhaps the person I have a crush on I don’t really like , it’s more “the mental image” of them which I have created in my mind.

When I see her IRL  I’m not infatuated, by all means she’s attractive, but she’s not some “be all end all “figure I have painted her out to be.  IRL we just talk like friends, but when we text it’s different. Maybe it’s because my infatuation has decreased  because “i see them as hard to get”.

Dude 10 years ago you could still grab a girl’s ass at a bar and it would genuinely work to your advantage most of the time, even if she didn’t like it, another girl would see that behavior and be attracted to it.

Girls would actually fixate on YOU even if you just had one ‘box checked’ because Men were still seen as providers [not disposable]. It was not full on like the 50s in 2010 at all of course, but rather, ten years back were the final days of male-socio-centricity [at least until the next ‘Reset’ when they can not fend for themselves without male protection].

But in 2020 the younger females are completely emboldened with the belief they do not need men. I dare you to find a single, Western female that answers affirmatively to the question “Do you need a man?” Many are even convinced that they are just as physically capable as men and are reinforced in this falsehood by the (((culture))) while being kept from the consequences of this belief by the (((Government))). And as long as the current zeitgeist remains, My deepest most sincere advise to you is 

1. DO NOT TRY TO FILL A HOLE IN YOUR LIFE WITH A FEMALE OR EVEN FEMALES. Focus on specifically on improving yourself and do not chase girls at all. 

2. **DO NOT JOIN A DATING APP**. The very nature of dating apps reduces the value of a man to absolutely nothing, and unless you are very good looking you are likely to get demoralizing results for a myriad of reasons, including, but not limited to, algorithms that decide to **only** match you with severely obese woman, which Hinge will do. The kind of girl you imagine filling in the hole in your life doesn’t have a dating app because she’d be someone who wants to take care of/bond with a decent guy. 80% Dating app girls mostly want artificial attention from beta orbiters whom they have no intention to date/sleep with and only match with the top 10% of men (a study has shown), and this behavior that is relevant to the majority of female dating App users makes Tinder the equivalent of:

“Yo M20! Let’s go to this party tonight. There’s going to be 100 chicks and 100 guys. Yea, all the decent 4-10 on attractiveness scale girls will be put into a group and then all the duds [obese, ugly, tatted up debt slaves] put in another group. Since we’re not top dog 10 percentile Alpha, apparently us 90 guys are only allowed to wade through [or can expect to match with] all the duds while team Alpha gets to algorithmically parse through all the high sexual market value women. The party doesn’t sound fun? What could not be fun about being at this party watching 10 guys bang 80 chicks while us 90 guys quibble over these 20 Chelsey Clintons.

740,ayneb3,False,None,208,You have more to offer than just your physical appearance.,dating,"Just a little reminder to those who are online dating (or dating in general). The right people well accept you for all of you and the wrong people aren’t meant to be in your life. 

Edit: 

To clarify, I didn’t mean that physical appearance does not matter at all. I’m just saying that there is more to offer than just looks. 

It’s important to maximize your attractiveness: workout, eat healthy, groom yourself, dress nicely, take care of yourself in general so that it increases the chances of getting a date. When you look good, you feel good and people will feel that energy about you. You must ultimately love yourself first and not expect people to love you if you cannot love yourself. You cannot pour from an empty cup. 

I do agree that men have a harder time dating than woman. For the simple fact that woman are generally more desired than men etc and I can’t relate because I am not a male. 

I was just making a point to remind people that you have more to offer the world and the opposite sex than just your physical appearance, but this post turned into a good discussion and I appreciate everyone’s input and comments. :) 

Loneliness and rejection hurt but it’s important to remind yourself of the good qualities you possess too or dating will hurt your self-esteem and will ultimately make you have a harder time out there in the dating world. Remember that rejection isn’t always about you and try not to identify with it too much. Good luck everyone.

* Physical looks can be an indicator of good hygiene and if you take pride in yourself. Not all things, because some of it comes down to genetics and psychical features that cannot be changed, but grooming, dressing right, skin care, ect are all important.
* I am at the point in my life where I can accept my self flaws in and all. I want someone who can also look at their reflection and take pride in what they see.
* I want someone who will looks presentable to my family and friends. Not as army candy, but just as showing this person in my life takes good care of himself and therefore, will take good care of me.
* Your personality and intelligence have to shine through in your pics.  There are men that I swipe right on but debate for a bit because I might not be immediately super attracted to them, but something about their pictures intrigues me; they have a cat, they took a picture with a comedian I like, they look like they have friends and are the life of the party, they are  reading a book i find interesting, ect. 
* I think men have unrealistically high standards for women. I have known men who complain about being rejected by women, but they are only going for a certain type. I think it is important to know the ""lane"" you are in and adjust your expectations accordingly. There will always be exceptions to the rule, but overall, this will save you time and disappointment. 
* For example, when i swipe I am looking at pictures thinking; Does it look like we could meet at a bar and have a fun time on a Friday night. Do we look like a couple that that people would expect to see together. I swipe left on many SUPER hot guys on Tinder because I just know that it wouldn't be work out. 
* If you don't want to be judge on looks, stay away from the apps. Try personal ads! A lot of place still run them in their local paper or gazettes (RIP Craiglist Personals). These focus more on writing styles and what you are looking for. 
* However, I can tell you I take a lot from the dating apps (tinder& bumble mainly) then just physical appearances. Does he know how to take a proper selfie A guy who takes a picture from a bad angle and frowning just shows a lack of social intelligence and suaveness.  What activities is he doing? Sense of humor in his pics? How does he dress?
* For example: I think my dating app pictures tell you that I: am obese but dress feminine and in flattering clothes. I can be glammed up or dressed down. I have a bright smile that shows my bubbly personality, I have attractive friends that I like to go out with and be social with. Those are all physical things that you can gather from my profile and I think it says a lot about me and what type of girl I am. As mentioned at the top, I'm not a 10.  I'm a high end estimate of a 6.3 maybe for guys that are even into big girls to begin with.
* Last but not least, I want to be with someone who is attracted to me psychically. I don't wanna be with someone who has to force themselves to see through my personality to like me. I've hooked up with guys who have later told me they just weren't into dating fat girls. and while I appreciated their honestly, I wish they had told me that before they we hooked up. Yes, dating and love are more then just about physical attraction, but you don;t have to be a 10 to find someone who is attracted to you.  ",2019-03-08 07:09:03

We have been hooking up and drinking together about once a week. This started right after I broke up with my ex so I thought of this guy as kind of a rebound...

I’ve started to get feelings for him. He’s never been in a serious relationship at all and never seemed like he wanted to. Which seemed fine with me until a couple weeks ago. He said he’s been thinking more about getting into a relationship with someone because his friends and family think it would be good for him. Last week he started talking to me about having kids together later on in life... asked me to stay over so we could cuddle.. was generally being pretty “coupley” with me. 

I realized after I left his place that I didn’t want him to be with anyone else... so tonight I decided to say something. It didn’t go the way I wanted, he said his crush he had on me previously was gone, and that he has never been a serious relationship kinda guy and probably never will be. I tried to say I wasn’t trying to be serious, I just wanted a little something more. And to take some time to think about this and he said he is pretty much decided 

I am pretty hurt by this obviously, but what I came here to say is, don’t ever be afraid to say whatever it is that you are afraid to say. Now I don’t have to wonder what “could have been” with this guy. I’m actually really proud of myself for being brave enough to say how I feel. I would have never done this in the past!

I took a break. Even un joined this thread because I really just wanted to move on with my life.

I ask this because I stopped dating due to insecurities and pitfalls I had personally. I feel that I need to gain my confidence again. I don’t want to project my problems onto someone else nor do I want to be anxious to be exclusive with someone when in reality I should relax and let it be.

How do you few really just keep going? I used to have that confidence but at the same time I, dating from one person to another kind of made me feel uncomfortable.

753,ai170n,False,None,60,Victory in a grocery store and a date the same night,dating,"(31 F). Did my typical grocery shopping on the weekend. I needed a new pillow, so I was looking around and ran into a guy. He asked me questions about memory foam and air mattresses. He was going on a trip with some friends. 

I made conversation and kind of threw out a vague “Oh are you going with your wife/gf?” Since he was older he caught on to what I was doing. He asked me why I asked. I told him he was attractive. I didn’t expect him to ask for my number immediately after. Never in my life has this ever happened. I feel very proud of myself. 

Not going to lie I was a bit nervous as I just met him and didn’t know much. We ended up going on a nice date to get some food and go see a movie. He touched me the majority of the movie. It felt so nice to actually have affection. (My last relationship had no affection and was very verbally abusive) 

We ended up kissing at the end of the night. I text him as a courtesy to let him know I had a good time and to give him a compliment. He did text back. I’m not going to read to much into this as I know how dating is now. 

We both aren’t seeking a relationship, but I do eventually want one just not anytime soon. 

Regardless of the outcome I’m very happy it happened. (I’m a pretty positive person, but my assumptions will always go to “Yeah that’s gonna be it.”) 

I’m trying my best to play it kool and not stress if I don’t hear from him at all, but I don’t want to come off as uninterested. Should I just lay low and not text anymore until I hear something? 

Another thing ladies. Just go for it. If you get rejected oh well. Or you might be surprised. After years of off and on OLD I told myself I would never do it again. I’m glad I stuck to it.

I saw this on the showerthoughts reddit and it's absolutely true: ""Tinder is the self esteem booster app for average looking woman and self esteem destroyer for average looking men"". That's true not just about Tinder but online/offline dating in general. If you are a minority guy double worse--this isn't whining. It's reality backed by research (look up Dataclysm and Chris Rudder's research on OKCupid that was publicized on FiveThirtyEight, Time, etc) . Thing is it's what people *say*, and what they *actually do* are different. And that applies very much to dating too, especially as there will be exceptions that give advice based on their one special situation without acknowledging general trends OR they will fall into the ""do as I say, not as I do"" trap. 

Online dating is basically tall white guys or non-white guys with supermodel looks getting matching and meeting 80% of the women.

Now that said: That's the game. It's what attracts women initially fair enough, we're not entitled to any one specific person. People are attracted to what they are, so I don't begrudge women for being into tall white guys. Now this is not about women-hating, that's a dark place to go into. Biology and social norms/preferences are hard to overcome.

So I think we average, not super extroverted guys need to realize we have to approach this differently. My advice or 2 cents is to change the approach and just work on the basics:

\- **Gym** (because you'll look better AND it's good for you)

\- **Wear clothes that fit**

\- **Find one or two hobbies that you like, and go all in unapologetically**. It's easy to get insecure about your intersets--for example, I'm not into NFL or UFC at all. IDGAF about either, and it can make one seem meek when in the company of the boys chatting about it. But oh well.

\- **Be a little more social than your comfort leve**l. Just a little more. No need to become a hi-fiving woooo\~! bro at the bar. Just means maybe saying yes to more invites. Inviting someone you haven't before to do something social.

I think doing these four things can help us average guys just be more happy and comfortable with ourselves. Because being miserable or waffling in self-pity or having this resentment in us then becomes a reinforcing cycle. I think the problem is we compare ourselves too much, and also we set ourselves up to fail by playing a game that's not for us. Perhaps we should just optimize ourselves, and work at self-love, it might help our dating life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/a1lblp/average_guys_are_screwed_the_numbers_are_working/,185,You had to post this thread twice.

756,c7bmlj,False,None,13,So I flirted for the first time,dating,"First sorry for my english, I'm working on it.

I'm a 22 year old man. I used to spend my time at home, doing solo activities without really thinking about socializing with people in the real world. I just had fun on my own because of trust issues towards people.
A friend of mine invited me a few times to hang out with his friends at bars in Paris. The first times I was kind of scared of what could happen because I don't speak that much and didn't want to spend the night being quiet therefore I used to find BS last-second excuses not to go.

 But then I've been to Iceland on a trip with the class (3rd year and about to get my licence degree). We had nothing else to do beside going to bars at night and it drastically changed my point of view. Why would I spend week-ends at home when I can have fun with people ?

So this week I asked my friend if they were planning on going out this week-end and he invited me to come meet his buddies. 
I made the effort of talking to everybody and was quickly integrated in the group (despite not talking much nowadays, I was the complete opposite before so it wasn't that hard afterall). 
At one point this girl joined us and I immediately started to talk to her, asking questions about what she does in life, what she likes etc. Turned out she has a very interesting point of view on some things in life so we discussed for about an hour on deep topics. 
I noticed we had a lot of eye contact when talking, and while sitting, she was replacing herself closer to me from time to time so I didn't miss opportunities to slightly compliment her and imply we should meet again. I really surprised myself at how direct and stressless I was at flirting. I now think it's natural for all men but sometimes we just convince ourselves its not. 
At the end I offered her a cocktail, she said she was very thankfull and we kept talking a bit. Maybe 10 minutes before she lives I asked her number and told her we should meet soon again and she blushed and didnt reply.
What amazes me is how I kept control of myself and how things have gone perfectly smoothly. Really it's no big deal at all. 

This morning she sent me that she "" spent a good night yesterday :3 "". I'm think about inviting her in Paris again next saturday but honestly I don't make it a big deal at all once again. 
In fact we didn't talk at all about relationships and what she expects because 1) I didn't even think of questioning her about that 2) I think it would be too early anyway. I don't even know what I want with her or if I' ready to date someone. What is your advice on what i should do next ?

TLDR : I've never dated girls, never really been to bars talking with strangers, never flirted. But I somehow managed to flirt a bit with a girl I met there. She looks interested, gave me her number and now I'm thinking about asking her out again. I dont foresee any relationship for now but I'm curious where it could lead us.  What would you advise to do next ?
For the guys who think it's hard, just drink a bit its a good way to stay calm and keep control of the situation. The flirting process is easy when the girl is receptive, it even encourages to go deeper in the process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/c7bmlj/so_i_flirted_for_the_first_time/,183,">Why would I spend week-ends at home when I can have fun with people ?

Leave everything you see. Do the 24 month no contact period. Go on Elon's Mars flight if that's what it takes to get you away from it during the 24 month no contact period, you are honest about your skills and qualifications during the interview and you can do so no later than about a year into the 24 month n-c. If you go on the Mars flight, you would be clear that you are doing it to get away from your ex, who you mention by name. Seriously. As long as you have no migraines nor other sensitivity to the burnt steak smell that's everywhere in space, even being Space Ex is better than being reminded of her during the 24 months. If you're in the USA and aren't going on the Mars flight, research, make and carry out a plan to permanently leave to England, not inside London, if you're able. This sounds like extreme measures, but advisability is not a suggestion. It's a cause.

Dates like ice skating, which costs $15 for 2 people (on Groupon, live within your means, don’t break your bank if you don’t have to). Going to a museum, or to the park or the beach when the weather is nice, depending on where you live. I can’t speak for men, because I’m a girl, and I don’t really know if you guys even like cute dates, but I know a lot of ladies who would love this type of effort, but it’s hard to wade through the people (men and women) who just want to have sex and go.

764,92wqmc,False,Giving Advice,45,Why it's okay to be single.,dating,"TL;DR: Social media's a lie, your singleness does not define you, and you can have a fun life without a SO. 

Look, I've been there. Your friends are all going out on dates, posting on social media about their SO, and seeing all the comments from people about how they're ""relationship goals."" Meanwhile you're spending your Friday night on your own (again...), feeling lonely, and binge watching the newest season of Arrow on Netflix (no? Just me? Ok...) 

You want a relationship, but can't find someone no matter how hard you try. The girl you thought was infatuated with you is ""too busy"" to go out. The guy who was flirting with you at the party won't even return your text. I've been there, and I know how it feels to want a relationship so bad when it seems nobody will give you a chance. 

I know coming from a stranger on the internet, this may mean nothing, but here's a few lessons I had to learn to be content with being single.

- Social media is a BIG FAT LIE. The whole point of social media is to make your life look better than it actually is. Those pictures of your friend at the beach cuddling with her ripped boyfriend? Those pics of your bro at the club grinding on his hot girlfriend? All lies. Life ain't a Disney movie. Couples have the same problems we do (maybe even more). Just because someone posts a cute picture with a caption like, ""I love you to the moon and back ❤"" doesn't mean that they have a happy relationship. Once you realize it's all just a show, it becomes much easier to enjoy being single. 


- Your singleness does not define you. Sure, the constant questions from your friends and family about, ""When are you gonna start dating someone?"" may have you thinking otherwise. And that's your first mistake. Letting the opinion of someone (even if it's someone you love) pressure you into finding a relationship will only lead to more problems down the road. If you want a relationship because you think it'll make your life better, by all means do so. If you want a relationship just so Grandma Bethany will stop nagging you about it, reexamine yourself and find out who/what you are doing this for. Life gets a lot easier when you just stop caring what others think.


- Being single doesn't mean you can't have a fun and fulfilling life. Sure, it would be nice to have someone to watch the new Mission Impossible movie with, but that doesn't mean I can't watch it on my own. 

Story time: One time I asked this girl to go see Justice League. She said she'd ""think about it"" and that she'd get an answer to me soon. Being the idiot I was at the time, I waited for her answer. 2 freaking weeks, until she decided to cancel it all together. That weekend, I decided, ""Forget it. I've been waiting for this movie all year, I'm seeing it with or without her."" And while the movie was nothing to write home about, I still had a fun time that I probably wouldn't have had if I was with a girl who didn't give a crap about me. 

Once you drill these 3 guidelines into your head, you'll realize that being single is NOT a curse. Sure, a relationship would be great, but being single doesn't mean you're a failure at life or that no one will ever love you (2 things I've thought a lot about before...). It's simply a fact about yourself, like what TV show you like or what's your favorite color. It doesn't determine how ""socially superior"" you are. It just means you're free and down to mingle.

Guys weigh in too.",dating,"I’ve realized that I avoid texting guys I like first as an attempt to not seem clingy. I feel like women are conditioned now to play down their feelings because the worst thing we could be seen as is being clingy or needy, or showing that we’re interested because men like “a chase”. I realize I have possibly sabotaged many texting stages with men in the past who may have been more interested than I assumed because I wanted to seem cool and carefree, but probably came off as uninterested. I’ll be the one to text first now, but I still like when a guy is mostly the first one to reach out. 

Maybe I am overthinking, but I’m just wondering if anyone else relates?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gvf5wf/ladies_mostly_does_anyone_else_refrain_from_being/,178,"""the chase"" isn't as much communication as it is the physical side of things. Guys want open and honest communication, that's what should be expected. Talking to each other regularly is good and won't come off as clingy unless you're panicking if you go a day without a response.

The chase you're thinking of is the physical intimacy side of things. If a guy gets a girl to bed date one, he's much more likely to get bored as it goes and that's pretty deep rooted biologically. 

You have no need to worry about guys getting upset or bored if you text often. If anything, texting very rarely will just make men give up because they assume you aren't interested or have found someone better, as you said. ",2020-06-02 20:31:13

I'm linking it in the comments since I can't link it here, but there's a lot interesting tidbits about online dating in particular such as:

>In all dating markets, apps appear to be most helpful to the highly photogenic. As Emma, a 26-year-old virgin who sporadically tries her luck with online dating, glumly told me, “Dating apps make it easy for hot people—who already have the easiest time.” Christian Rudder, a co-founder of OkCupid (one of the less appearance-centric dating services, in that it encourages detailed written profiles), reported in 2009 that the male users who were rated most physically attractive by female users got 11 times as many messages as the lowest-rated men did; medium-rated men received about four times as many messages. The disparity was starker for women: About two-thirds of messages went to the one-third of women who were rated most physically attractive. A more recent study by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Santa Fe Institute found that online daters of both genders tend to pursue prospective mates who are on average 25 percent more desirable than they are—presumably not a winning strategy.  
>  
>So where does this leave us? Many online daters spend large amounts of time pursuing people who are out of their league. Few of their messages are returned, and even fewer lead to in-person contact. At best, the experience is apt to be bewildering (*Why are all these people swiping right on me, then failing to follow through?*). But it can also be undermining, even painful. Emma is, by her own description, fat. She is not ashamed of her appearance, and purposefully includes several full-body photos in her dating profiles. Nevertheless, men persist in swiping right on her profile only to taunt her—when I spoke with her, one guy had recently ended a text exchange by sending her a gif of an overweight woman on a treadmill.  
>  
>An even bigger problem may be the extent to which romantic pursuit is now being cordoned off into a predictable, prearranged online venue, the very existence of which makes it harder for *anyone*, even those not using the apps, to extend an overture in person without seeming inappropriate. What a miserable impasse.

&#x200B;

>He had better luck with Tinder than the other apps, but it was hardly efficient. He figures he swiped right—indicating that he was interested—up to 30 times for every woman who also swiped right on him, thereby triggering a match. But matching was only the beginning; then it was time to start messaging. “I was up to over 10 messages sent for a single message received,” he said. In other words: Nine out of 10 women who matched with Simon after swiping right on him didn’t go on to exchange messages with him. This means that for every 300 women he swiped right on, he had a conversation with just one.  
>  
>At least among people who don’t use dating apps, the perception exists that they facilitate casual sex with unprecedented efficiency. In reality, unless you are exceptionally good-looking, the thing online dating may be best at is sucking up large amounts of time. As of 2014, when Tinder last released such data, the average user logged in 11 times a day. Men spent 7.2 minutes per session and women spent 8.5 minutes, for a total of about an hour and a half a day. Yet they didn’t get much in return. Today, the company says it logs 1.6 billion swipes a day, and just 26 million matches. And, if Simon’s experience is any indication, the overwhelming majority of matches don’t lead to so much as a two-way text exchange, much less a date, much less sex.

I got so many messages, my app was crashing. So many creeps. I messaged a few back, but it either got weird or didn't go anywhere. But one guy just asked me why I was on the app. I said I was lonely, and he asked to Snapchat. 

I expected him to ask for nudes and all that, but I was surprised when he didn't. He was ice fishing with his brothers and it was Christmas Eve. I like fishing, so we got to talking. 

We talked 24/7 (except when we were sleeping) every day after that.  Snapchat and text every minute were awake. He calls me on my work break every evening. We have soooo much in common. I'm super outdoorsy and he is too. Plus he's cute as hell and sooo sweet lol. 

He's in the next state over, almost 5 hours away. But I jumped in my car and headed over there for a whole weekend two weeks after we started talking. 

I had the time of my life. We went ice fishing for 12 hours, and I had a blast. We went back to his place and smoked weed, and he made me amazing chicken enchiladas. We had sex, which was mind blowing. I had never had sex so good lol. We watched Netflix and cuddled until we fell asleep. 

He came to my place this weekend. I took him fishing on my favorite lake. We hot boxed his fishing shack, and had some risky sex.

775,b33lc6,False,Venting,72,9 months ago she cheated on me while my mother was dying in the hospital.,dating,"4 years after a bad breakup I finally found my next girlfriend. I've  never been with anyone this amazing to me in my life. She's cute, smart,  a very hard worker. She wants to do things with me that no other girl  I've never been with wanted to do like ride bikes in a different town  every single weekend. She cooked with me and we never argued. I thought  this one was going to be the one. I couldn't imagine any other woman  being the mother of my children.

Almost a year of seeing each other and countless adventures later my  mom's health started to decline. My mother recently was taken to the  hospital when she had collapsed in Goodwill while shopping. They've  given me a timeline of when they expect her to pass away now. This was a  couple of weeks ago.

The day my mom was admitted to the hospital I rushed from work to go  see her. When I got there she said hey and then started to cough up a  lot of blood. It was all over her hospital gown and face. This is not  how you want to see your mother. I was quickly rushed out of the room by  an orderly so they could work on my mom. In a panic and with the  childhood death of my father fresh in my mind at this moment, I reached  out to my girlfriend. Her responses were short. The phone call sent  straight to voice mail. No worries. She's busy. She's a social worker  and they are always busy.

Over the next couple of weeks her not reciprocating any affection but  still allowing me to buy her gifts and work on her landscaping, the  truth finally came out.

Last Saturday I spent the entire day working in her yard. Laying  boarder stones, digging up bushes and planting things. The next day we  were supposed to drive to a neighboring town with our bikes in tow to  ride a rail trail we've never ridden before. I asked if she wanted me to  spend the night at her home or if she wanted to spend the night at mine  so that we could head out early in the morning. She told me that she  wanted to sleep in her own bed alone due to the amount lack of sleep  she's gotten that week. She also said that she was going to eat with her  mom and her mom's house that night then go to bed at home. She would  see me early at my house the next morning.

Sunday morning rolled around and she calls me. Told me the plans had  changed. Said that she had to put all this out there at once that she  had been over at an exboyfriend's house that lives over and hour away  from her that night having a ""beer"". This was the first time that she  had been there in years and they were just catching up on old times. We  weren't going to be able to ride now because her car was vandalized.

In these pictures is her car in the exboyfriend's driveway. Apparently  a jealous lover of his knew who she was and knew what they were doing  in his house. She swears that they weren't having sex. Even said that  his kids were there and she wouldn't if they were.

Well fast forward a little bit.  I have figured out that she's been there 3  times at least in the past 7 days. She doesn't realize that she has  geolocation turned on and with the EXIF metadata in a selfie she sent  while I was texting her last Wednesday I was able to figure out that she  was in his driveway. She was waiting on him because as soon as he got  there she stopped texting for 2 and a half hours.

Another thing. This person that is attacking her also posted a nasty  message pointing out her lover's and her cheating behavior to her  employer. This post was 6 hours before she was caught there while I was  working with her in her yard. Funny how she hadn't been there in years  but this random person knew she was going there.

Stupid me didn't piece all this together until that day. That day my mom  flat lined. They were able to resuscitate her. My girlfriend or now  exgirlfriend was once again AWOL.

Tomorrow I'm going to dump her after writing a letter explaining in  detail how I figured out she was lying and how bad this hurt me during  one of the worst points of my life. Right now I need someone. I have a  very small support group. My mom will be my last family member in this  country I can talk to. When she goes I'll be pretty much alone.

I lost what I had once thought was the love of my life and my mother around the same time.

This is the saddest period of my life and I feel like she's broken a good man.

777,b6kea6,False,Giving Advice,63,Sick of being single? Offend someone.,dating,"&#x200B;

(this is written as an encouragement, not as insult or put down)

&#x200B;

Through the recent tragic suicide of my ex fiance of 8 years (and me essentially becoming a widower before being a husband, at age 36), in which during the final minutes of his life, he has skype video called me — a call that lasted a full 90 minutes... from 7790 miles away... in 1080p... not asking me to save him.. but wanted my blessing for his final journey in his 3rd attempt after suffering from 4 years of depression... with a plate of charcoal burning on the side and more than a dozen sleeping pills already ingested...  — it got me thinking :

&#x200B;

why did he trust me in dying when many others don’t even have someone who ***ever*** have trusted them in living?

&#x200B;

My body is mediocre, face is acceptable, earn in low 6-figures but nowhere close to being a 1%-er, and definitely not the nicest person around. Am I that lucky, or is everyone else so unlucky ?

&#x200B;

For perpetually single folks, ranging from the uber hot very successful types, good enough all around but lower self esteem, circuit party queens, to so-so quality guys, I think I finally found the common theme that links them, which also points to each of those solving the wrong problem, and the solution I'm proposing doesn’t involve any part of physical appearance or money either —

&#x200B;

**THEIR WILL TO TAKE A STAND**

&#x200B;

The one common theme among this vast array of friends and acquaintances is that, driven by their desire to either maximize friend gain or minimize friend/potential candidate lost, all have a personality that prevents them from willing to take a stand ... on anything.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand doesn’t have to be on political topics. Doesn't have to be as polarizing as #RESISTANCE vs. #MAGA. e.g. Publicly declaring you like Benz over BMW is taking a stand. Saying you like Korean cuisine but not Japanese ones is taking a stand. Packers over Eagles is taking a stand. But saying you like everything and don’t hate anything isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand must involve prioritizing one item over another, and not hiding the preference when others inquire about it. Secretly loving Star Trek over Star Wars but telling others you love both or you have no pref isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

But that also entails the single risk all of the groups appear unwilling to bear — the risk of offending ANYONE. If u like A over B and make the preference public, people who like B may not understand why, and thus may get offended, however unreasonably that may be.

&#x200B;

So, this group of people, fear of losing any potential partying buddies or dating candidates, would present themselves as friendly-to-all, care-free, opinion-free (and maybe even cage-free), while punting all decision-making to someone else (deciding something on behalf of others is also taking a stand, even something as basic as like deciding a place for lunch) It goes back to them being single... because what exactly is dating?

&#x200B;

**Dating is someone willing to take a stand...** ***ON YOU*****.**

&#x200B;

Someone willing to pick you. Someone willing to shoulder the risk of offending his friends who don’t like because they believe you are important, and believe you are worth it. But it has to be reciprocal and mutual - they expect that you also would've taken a stand on him in the process.

&#x200B;

The obvious question to ask is — why would anyone be willing to take a stand on you when all they see is someone unwilling to take a stand on anything? Not just something, but **ANYTHING**, and ***EVERYTHING***.

&#x200B;

Many of them kept thinking others found theirs due to shear. dumb. luck.

Some thought their body isn’t hot and buff enough.

Some thought they’re not rich enough.

Some thought they’re not nice enough.

&#x200B;

So they all waste time solving the wrong problem, and doubling down when the solution doesn't seem to have yielded returns (in their minds : ""....yet""). But it boils down to — maybe, they aren’t principled enough to have principles. Start with taking a stand on everyday life options, like a car, a ski resort, an island in Hawaii, a book recommended by Oprah, a game console (yes, i'm the nut job who loves Nintendo Switch), take the risk of potentially offending one of your 4500 facebook ""friends"" and 6000 IG ""followers"",

&#x200B;

...and maybe, one day, someone is willing to take a stand on you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/b6kea6/sick_of_being_single_offend_someone/,177,"I've been married twice, and had several serious relationships, one of which resulted in kids which were stolen from me and taken across the country because their mother wanted to be polyamorous and I didn't. The fairy tale was murdered a long time ago. At this point in my life you can't convince me that women aren't simply evil, opportunistic predators. I've had hundreds of girlfriends and friends who are girls in my 32 years and I see what happens behind our backs. Relationships always made me the happiest out of any undertaking I have ever pursued. I used to adore caring for people that I loved and before my epiphany and gut wrenching realization of what women really are, I was a seriously good dude. 

Not anymore. 

If you want to be happy, go to sleep. Have a good dream. Because the sad fact is we live in a full-time nightmare where terrible things happen as a rule. I came to the realization recently that life is just a painful hiccup in eternity that only lasts until such time as you are mercifully returned to your natural state of nonexistence. 

If you want to keep your sanity intact, stay far away from commitment. Use and lose...and stay safe. Girls are finally getting used to being fucked and never spoken to again, thank heavens, so the future looks even brighter now that all those guilt trips and questions are quickly fading away.

778,ad0yuj,False,Tinder/Online Dating,383,"Why do men on dating sites insist on meeting straight away, and usually hiking?? (I'm F)",dating,"Due to personal preference and anxiety, I prefer to talk to people for at least a short while on dating sites (Tinder, OkCupid, POF, etc.) before meeting up. I've seen this labeled as ""pen pal-ing"" and is apparently a common frustration for men seeking women. I've also noticed a common first activity suggestion is always hiking, which I'm going to be honest, is the last place I want to go with someone I've just met, especially a man. That's how you get murdered. 

&#x200B;

The way I see it, I'm feeling out their personality to see if they're worth meeting, and to not go hiking partially because I don't like it very much, but also because I don't want to go into the woods with someone I've never met before. But apparently, this is a huge annoyance. 

&#x200B;

Men of Reddit who are on dating sites, what's your guys' take on this?



Edit: Wow this got way more attention than I thought it would!!! I just wanted to clarify a few points I see being repeated. 

1. I do live in the PNW, so hiking is a common activity here, but with that said, even on the most populated trails, there are still lulls in the by-traffic that leave plenty of opportunities for harm to be done. Not to mention nowhere on my profile have I mentioned nature nor do I have any nature pictures. Hiking is not an activity I particularly enjoy. 

2. When I say I want to feel out their personality, I dont mean weeks or months. I mean a few days of solid conversation to try to make sure they're not just looking for a hookup, and to make sure our personalities are somewhat compatible enough to be across from the table, bar, whatever. I dont want to be pen pals for months. That's boring. But I dont want the third message out of the gate to be ""let's go out"" or ""can I have your number."" Give me just a half a second!

Thanks for all your replies!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ad0yuj/why_do_men_on_dating_sites_insist_on_meeting/,177,texting a stranger is completely useless. the chemistry doesn't carry over to real life interaction and may even make it more awkward if you have expectations from texting someone for weeks. i also seriously question someone who doesn't have anything better to do than text a literal stranger ,2019-01-06 01:48:00

2. Using the same pose in every picture equates to you being a basic beezy to many men.

3. Duck lips are still not attractive to a lot of men.

4. If you open the conversation on us, you'll set yourself far apart from the pack in some of our eyes.

5. If you can kick our ass, it only makes some of us like you more.

6. A lot of guys still think y'all want that Disney Princess stuff to happen to you, and see it as an abysmal task.

7. We have no idea what you're thinking of EVER, we just get lucky with our guesses sometimes.

8. If we ask about food, at least say something that has a broad scope, sometimes i.e. Mexican food, Chinese, etc. Or anything better than idc

780,dkzsky,False,I Need Advice,121,I think my boyfriend has a crush and it bothers me.,dating,"So I have been with my boyfriend about a year now and I've become increasingly uncomfortable with one of his sister's friends. Now I have nothing against her personally but I have the feeling my boyfriend has a crush on her. Now him having a crush wouldn't be a problem if it was a celebrity, not someone he knows in real life. He tries to deny it but I don't believe him. I tried bringing it up again today and he said ""what if I did? Would you be upset?"" Then he saw me getting upset and saying I'm the one who he should love. He says he loves me and that he doesn't have a crush on her, that he was speaking hypothetically. He said over and over that he doesn't have a thing for her. 


He's a friendly guy and he was upfront about the friendliness before we were together,  but hes always giggly around her. Like sometimes I just want to hide myself and be preoccupied on my phone because I can't stand it. Went to a yard sale yesterday where things were given away for free. He found a half dry erase/bulletin board he said he wanted for his room.. then later on he decides to give it to his sister, who supposedly doesn't want it and he gave it to the friend instead. Went to Dollar Tree and one of the things he buys is dry erase markers he gave to her.. he didn't buy me anything. His parents also said they heard him ranting outside about what I told him and said it was sad that I don't trust him and that he comes home to me. I have suspected for a while that he's been into her. He said in the past he was interested in her because she likes the music he likes, but that he didn't pursue her because it was his sister's friend. 

It's not even just the way he acts around her, it's social media too. He's always ""hearting"" or ""liking "" her photos even when I've told him the hearts bother me. He did it as recently as last night. He says this is how he is showing support to others, especially as she is a fitness guru. 

Now please before I suspect that I'll be told I'm being possessive,  insecure etc.. understand where I'm coming from. I'm very outspoken and don't hide how I feel. I pay attention and I'm just not sure how to not let this bother me. Am I looking into this too much? I know bringing it up again will annoy him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dkzsky/i_think_my_boyfriend_has_a_crush_and_it_bothers_me/,173,"You may be insecure.

“Into Fitness” or “workout regularly” with multiple bathing suit / gym photos or IG tag only = Code for I’m somewhat vein and superficial but I’m also fit and expect you to be as well.

“Go out or stay in” or “Ambivert” = Code for I’m not an anxiety-ridden recluse and I’m also not overcompensating for personality flaws with raw energy.

“Positive outlook” = Code for I know or have known someone with depression and am not looking to bring more of that into my life. 

“Day drinking” with more than one photo with an adult beverage = Code for I’m alcoholic and/or enjoy binge drinking. 

Fluent in Sarcasm = Code for I’m mean and snarky but I play it off as humor.

Does anyone else feel like it brings so much negativity into their life??,dating,"I'm 27F, and I've never really been on a relationship due to the way I was raised. I've always been shy, and I never made any efforts on meeting people. Relationships were never really on my mind until lately. 


I've spent years working on myself, I successfully became a mechanical engineer, I'm proud of myself and what I've accomplished. I worked on improving myself the last few years, I'm more outgoing, stopped being afraid of going out of my comfort zone, I enjoy my own company, and I like spending time with people as well and meeting new people. I take care of myself, I dress nicely, I look nice, I have a great body shape. 


And I figured, since I'm in a good place with myself, I could try putting myself more out there, and go on dates. 


My friends suggested dating apps. So I went for it with no expectations at first but to meet new people, go on dates and see where it all goes.


First of all, I can not go on dates with multiple people at the same time! For all of you who can, I don't know how you can give your energy to many people at the same time...


So I only met with 3 guys in total (not at the same time, these stories are at least 1 month apart), the rest I match with they either don't even talk, were just passing by the city and by the time you match they're 500 miles away, or straight up start telling you what they want to do to you (gross)! 


________________________


So with the first guy, we dated for 3 months. We were intimate too. Last time we saw each other, he didn't stop telling me how much he'd love to see me again. Then after that begun the fade away, saying he's too busy. I gave up at some point... then asked him months later why he disappeared without saying anything. He simply said that ""we didn't owe each other anything"".


________________________


Second guy I met, he texted and talked a LOT! We met the first time, it all went well. Then we kept talking and texting each other after that, he seemed so into me. And the way he was talking about his last relationships, he didn't seem like the type who dates around. We had plans to meet a week later. 


The day of the date. He texed me in the morning, and started a normal conversation like always. He told me that he went out for a drink the night before then went back home and ""slept like a baby"". 

We kept talking through the day about random stuff (we were supposed to meet the same evening). Then at some point I asked him if he was still keen to meet up. He then said ""the truth is, I went out for a drink with a girl last night, and she ended up spending the night at my place, so I don't think it would be appropriate to meet tonight"".... B*TCH! And why didn't you say it earlier to cancel the damn date?? (Actually asked this in a calm way). He said that he didn't know how things will evolve with her, and so he didn't say anything.


I felt like I was an option, or like it's whoever agreed on having sex first...then what's the point on going on a date and getting to know the person if all you're looking for is a hole. 

But what really pissed me off, is the fact that he kept avoiding saying anything about it until last minute, and didn't even think about canceling the date before. 


But then ok, I guess I should be at least glad he didn't lie and date us both at the same time.


________________________


The 3rd and last guy, I met him last friday. The date was great! We had so much in common, we liked the same stuff and we were both surprised to find out. He looked like he had a really great time, and while we were walking after dinner, he kissed me in a very smooth way. We made out again later before parting ways. We kept texting each other the next day. It all seemed like it was going well until he sent me out of nowhere ""friday was really fun, but I'd like to leave it at that""...  I know for a fact that he didn't meet anyone in between. It's fine, but I just don't get where it all went wrong!

________________________


I know that what happened to me are things that normally happen. Especially with online dating. But I just can't get how this all works, and it's tiring! 

I hate how getting rejected suddenly started affecting my self esteem and my mood! And I don't know how to deal with that. I feel jaded, and tired, and I have no desire to meet anyone or put anymore efforts on that.

I've had my share of online dating, and I'm done with it.

In my opinion, and this comes only from my personal experience and observations of others is that if you are still within a year of getting together, you are still learning about who the other person is. Even if you feel that beautiful deep connection in your soul (Which I truly believe in), this other person is still a stranger to you. You are learning who they are, which is part of the beautiful game of dating and of life.

You don't owe a stranger your mental and emotional health. If you see a red flag, feel the strength to take a step back and say to yourself, ""I have only been with this person a few months and this is what they are showing me as who they are. Is this who I want to be with?""

I have posted a couple times on here and just wanted to share a very positive experience.

Him \[26M\] and I \[24F\] met on an online dating app. Our third date was great but ended on a really awkward kiss (my first one). We had another date planned for yesterday. The day already started off great when he asked to meet up an hour earlier than planned because he “couldn’t wait.” He picked me up at my house. We went to his favorite restaurant for dinner because we were celebrating some big news for him. Over dinner we had a couple pauses where we would kind of just look at each other and smile a lot. I was like “what?” He told me he wasn’t seeing anyone else and I told him I wasn’t either. It was super cute. Turns out that I was the last person he was going to try dating with on the app before deleting it and he just happened to be the first person I matched with. Luck has been on our sides. We hold hands walking back to the car and drive back to my house. I live with my parents but invited him inside because I had made dessert for him (again, to celebrate his big news). We go downstairs. I could hear my parents upstairs and didn’t know if it was too soon to introduce him to them but I thought “what the hell, let’s do it.” They meet each other and it goes super well. We go back downstairs and sit on my couch eating the dessert.  Again, we just have those moments where we look at each other and smile a lot. Then, he hesitantly asks me if the kiss on our last date was my first one. Which is super embarrassing for me so I ask him, “what if it was?” He says he would feel really bad, that he didn’t want to rush things but he really wanted to kiss me last time so he did. I tell him not to worry about it, just that I don’t know what I am doing so he’s going to have to take the lead. In retrospect this whole conversation was perfect to me. He was so nice and understanding, I can’t explain it. So this time when he goes in for a kiss we are completely on the same page, it was so much better. I still don’t know what I am doing but I feel whole lot better about it because of him. We just sat there talking with each other and holding hands for a while until he had to go because he had to go to work the next day. It was the most perfect night. 

I just wanted to spread some positivity for those of you that might feel “behind” in terms of dating like I did.

TL;DR is basically the title. I have some baggage because of the bad situation I came out of. What follows is a fair bit of context for anyone who wants it.


Long story short, I dealt with a lot of isolation, manipulation, and domestic abuse (nothing physical) for most of my life. I escaped it all with my brother back in January and am happily on my own away from my messed up family.

I’m socially awkward due to this past, but I’m steadily improving myself in the world. I’m not in that great of a position financially, but then again, I’m starting from scratch so I won’t be 100% for a few years at least. I got a GED, a license, a part time job, a place to stay until I can afford my own rent, and have even branched out to form some platonic relationships. I would only dream of obtaining those things back at my old home. But as much as I’m improving in my life, I haven’t made much progress in as far as romance goes.

I don’t really have a car, so I’m limited to the place I’m in. It’s not ideal, but it’s completely doable because it’s a small, but decently populated city. 

My main social activities are me being at work and going to church on Sundays. I haven’t fully committed myself to online dating because I don’t know how to go about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/devuwl/im_a_20_m_and_have_never_dated_due_to_a_bad_home/,164,"Sorry to hear about your situation... at the same time though, everything you’ve said in this post is every reason why you can’t date... in your head, that is...

Joined hobby clubs at university, no women were interested.

How do some people manage to date multiple people by the age of 25? It just seems so bizarre to me when getting a women's number is a mission. I take care of myself, work out, make sure my clothes and hygiene are on point yet still have never met a woman who wanted to date me.

You're gonna hear ""Lower your standards, be a better person, don't be creepy, get a hobby, put yourself out there more"", etc. It sounds like you're doing all that, the same as Ive been for 32yrs.......but to no avail.

The biggest problems I see and hear nowdays with women are: 
1) Be ""genorous"".
2) ""Donate"" to them.
3) Have a ""tool"" bigger than a horses ""tool"".
4) Be Hollywood hot, buff.
5) Be confident
6) ""Try harder""
(The first 2 involving giving them or paying them noney just to go on a date.  It happens all the time now in 2020.)
The way women are nowdays, even though I do everything right, Im gonna be bound to be alone the rest of my life. Hopefully you'll score soon, you're still young and got a lot more time. Use it wisely.

Over the past month a lot things have happened that made me feel confident he felt the same way too.

Not that I was in love, but if I ever had a “love at first site” moment in my life it was her. For the past 2 months we were seeing each other twice a week at it was great, it just felt right. Asked her if she wanted to date exclusively 5 days ago and since then I’ve been getting the slow fade.

Work is not an option because I can go an entire day and not see a woman my age. Then I go to a busy gym where it would seem really weird to even talk to someone.

Pretty much every friend I have is dating someone now too. So if I go out I feel like an extra wheel.

All my previous relationships have just been through partying in college so I am lost. I wouldn’t say I’m really introverted but I am very... laid back. Do people really just go up and talk to strangers at places like grocery stores or whatever? Just seems so odd to me.

815,7zuaou,False,None,27,From a Blind Girl To You Lovely Guys Who Can See,dating,"Aloha ;) I'm a completely blind 19-year-old girl and I usually date blind or partially sighted guys but I'm a New Yorker and that's way too limiting. So far, I've been on seven first dates with sighted guys and most of them were in the last six weeks. So while everything is still fresh, I'm here to vent, apologize  and gush.
1. I'm not going to feel your face. I have a lot of ways to sneakily tell what you look like and I've only done that to boyfriends and really close friends because it seems pretty damn intimate.

2. Telling me about that beautiful or visually interesting thing you saw isn't insensitive. I actually find it sweet when someone is willing to go out of their way to share what makes them think or makes them happy.

3. It's really fucking adorable when I'm temporarily doing something that requires both hands and a guy offers to hold my cane or fold it for me. Yes, I can just hold it with an arm or shove it in my bag like I always do, and I'm too independent to ask, but this made me swoon.

4. If I like your voice and you're sweet/smart and can make me laugh )bonus points for original blind jokes and sarcasm(, I probably like you. So don't freak out if I ask for a picture or your Instagram so me and the girls can gossip, we all have different types and they don't decide who I date, unless you're an asshole to them or something.

5. If you're purposely walking through alleyways and joking about being a serial killer, don't be surprised when I don't trust you to guide me for the rest of the date.

6. First dates make me nervous, especially if I know it's someone's first meaningful interaction with a blind person. So if I seem like I've never swiped a metro card before or accidentally slap my silverware off the table, I promise I'm not usually like that and I'll be half as clumsy by the second date.

7. Don't read my phone screen, it's fucking RUDE and that's the reason I usually keep my screen curtain on.

8. I don't want to hear about how you like blindfolding girls during sex and you're happy you won't have to do that with me on a first date in the middle of a crowded restaurant.

9. I'm professing my love to the guy who already knows sign language to make life easier for deaf people and wants to learn Braille because different writing systems interest him. Of course, this isn't a requirement but reading and writing are big parts of my life and it's awesome if you're interested in something so important.

Andnd finally, if I'm flirting and getting slightly touchy during our date, I'd probably love a hug at the end. I know I've given a few half-assed ones but that's usually because I'm trying to get on the train or I feel bad about the cabdriver sitting there awkwardly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/7zuaou/from_a_blind_girl_to_you_lovely_guys_who_can_see/,161,"So when you are on reddit does you computer ""read"" stuff out to you?

817,hlozwr,False,Giving Advice,43,My method of testing the water,dating,"Sorry if this is not the right sub, first time here.

We've all been there: You're meeting a girl/guy, start talking, sitting next to each other, and things seem to go ok. They seem to be interested in you, and you want to make a move, but you're not sure if they are actually interested, or just being friendly/polite. Breaking the touch barrier might be a bit tricky: Touching their shoulder often doesn't have the effect you are looking for, as most of the time it does not provoke too much of a response, whether they like the touch or not. On the other hand, things like putting your hand on their thigh are too aggressive and could be very uncomfortable for the other person.

What I found to be working the best in between these options is gently touching their hand with yours. make a quick contact, maybe run your thump along their finger for a couple of seconds. If they are uncomfortable with that, they will automatically move their hand right away, and that would be the end of it. But if they are into you, they will take your hand, or reciprocate by being playful with their own fingers.

The advantage that I have found with that specific touch is that it is direct enough for the other person to realise you're not just touching them by accident/friendliness, but subtle and gentle enough to not be seen as intrusive or threatening, while giving the other person an easy way out if they are not interested.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/hlozwr/my_method_of_testing_the_water/,160,[deleted] ,2020-07-05 16:02:59
818,c76qqv,False,Venting,80,"I'm officially done with dating, and here's why",dating,"I don't intend for this to be a self-pity post after a string of shitty dating experiences, but I personally wanted to share mine and why I'm done with dating. I also don't mean for this to be a hate post toward men. I know there are good men out there, but they're hard for me to find.

I've only had one boyfriend. He was misogynistic. He repeatedly violated my physical boundaries. He liked to play the victim and shift the blame on me whenever I was hurt by him. Then I found out he cheated on me. I dumped him, of course, but my shitty relationship experience with him wasn't going to deter me from jumping back into the dating game and finding someone decent out there. I now realize that was too much for me to ask. A big lesson I learned is to not ignore red flags ever again.

The first guy I went on two dates with. He seemed normal the first time, and I really enjoyed our time spent together. He seemed so...sweet, normal. He didn't overstep any boundaries. The second date is when I started noticing something was off. He was kissing me way too much. That's not really the weird part. When I pulled away and told him that was enough, he would just lean in to kiss me again. He wanted to know my kinks and asked if I liked being choked while placing his hand over my neck and squeezing gently. He started kissing me again and asking me to tell him what I'm into, and I pulled away and said I'm not telling him, and he responded, ''No, you're telling me now.'' and he proceeded to kiss me. I honestly felt uncomfortable and I just wanted him to stop. He was also insistent on driving me to work afterwards even though I kept telling him I wanted to walk. I did speak to him about it later on over text and he was apologetic for making me feel uncomfortable.

There was another guy I was talking to for a while, we didn't meet right away but he became really needy and pushy. Then I went on a couple dates with ANOTHER guy. First two dates went pretty well, he seemed like a good guy. Very laid-back and introspective. We went on our third date last night and we were discussing our biggest fears. I told him I feared being physically harmed in some way, and he replied, ''Like how, being raped?'' and I replied yes, and he made a quip that I would probably enjoy it.

So, uh, yeah. This just about sums up my experience with dating men and I'm officially quitting. I know there are good guys out there, but I don't to have to sift through all the shitty ones just to find that one decent one. I'm focusing on myself henceforth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/c76qqv/im_officially_done_with_dating_and_heres_why/,160,"First, the fact that you apparently felt like you needed to specify that you don’t hate men, I think, speaks to how toxic so many men are. And the fact that you got “U H8 TEH MENZ” comments further supports that. You’re going to get those no matter what. Seems a bit... Toxic, no? I didn’t have this experience and I think it’s weird and gross when men tell women “I get it” anyway so I’m not even going to pretend I do but I can tell you I have sympathy. I only date and/or have sex with women so I don’t know about the romantic or sexual side personally but I have very much gotten sick of the toxicity and I’ve gotten to the point of not wanting other men outside my family in my life at all. All my friends are women and I avoid interacting with men whenever I can. It’s maddening. It’s amazing how quickly things go downhill when you start telling men “no.” Tell a man he can’t do or have something he wants and most of the time he becomes fucking Joffrey Baratheon. So I’m just very sick of the majority of my gender. It’s not a minority. Clearly it’s not. I mean obviously it’s not. I was raised to be toxic too. I had to figure shit out on my own. We’re raising boys wrong. My family and society at large failed me. We’re failing them too but we’re failing girls and women even worse and I think that’s plain to see. So I hope it helps a little at least to know there are other people who feel like you. I hope things work out for you and I hope you’re happy. Honestly. That’s not sarcasm. Whatever you ultimately decide, I hope you find good people to hang out with. Or if you have some already I hope you find more. ",2019-06-30 00:26:11
819,aldq3p,False,None,151,My (F25) experience with online dating as a hetero woman.,dating,"I'll get right to it. I've been using online dating on and off since I was 18. It's mostly been a lot of frustration. As a woman I understand that it's a lot of pressure to put on men to always expect them to make the first move, so I have always tried to get out there and make it known when I am into a guy. However, in doing so I have noticed a lot of common issues that are very likely getting in the way of people finding one another, so I thought I would make this post to hopefully help both men and women when it comes to online dating. Since I am heterosexual, I've really only seen straight men's profiles, so I'll be focusing on the issues that I see from that particular group as well as the quality of communication that I have received over the years:





1) **Profile Pictures** - Many of them are not even of the person themselves. A large majority have only one, poorly lit photo. Even more have only one picture in which they are wearing sunglasses that cover most of their facial features. Group photos that don't specify who is the profile owner. None of these options represents the person well. In my experience, I am far more likely to swipe left on a profile like this. It makes it very difficult to discern what someone looks like and determine whether you could be attracted to them or not. Whether you are confident in your looks or more on the shy side, either way, an accurate depiction of yourself will land you far more options than any of these I mentioned.





2) **Self Description** - I see far too many men's profiles that have ""ask me"" or just ""ask"" in every section. I understand the thought behind this, or what I assume to be the idea. If someone is interested enough, they will just ask, or maybe it's hard to know what to write. I get it. But remember, online dating is about marketing yourself to others. It's your job to do your best to represent yourself well and accurately to attract the kind of person you are looking for. I can say confidently that I immediately swipe left on this kind of profile no matter what the picture looks like. If you can't be bothered to fill in a little info about yourself, I'm not going to pull it out of you. That information is incredibly crucial. When someone does decide to message you, that information has already opened up a bunch of talking points and opportunity to get to know each other better. It's a super important factor to facilitate conversation. It's the combination of both pictures and personality that draws me to a guy. I personally appreciate an 'about me' section that reads like it was written honestly. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to give people an idea of who you are, what you love, and what you want out of life. A profile in which someone has put in some honest effort to convey that information is so much more attractive than ""ask me.""





3) **Omitting certain information** - Ok guys. Let's get real. Things like height, body type, having/not having kids, having a car, certain values, occupation etc. are all very important things when determining a partner. Whether you are totally satisfied with your current answers to these questions or not, I strongly recommend that you do answer them, and answer them honestly. Here's an example. I am a plus-sized woman. If I were to put on my profile that I am anything other than that, I would be matched up with men that don't prefer women of my size. I would then be disappointed that none of my matches are interested in me, and would have wasted a lot of my own time as well as others'. Instead, I answer it honestly and say that I am, in fact, a large woman. So I am matched up with men that are open to dating someone like me, and I have far better luck with dating. Makes sense, right? No matter what you have, where you are in life, what you look like, there is someone out there for everyone. But it's going to be a lot more difficult if you are casting your net in the wrong direction. Tell us the truth about things, guys. It's well worth it.





4) **Communication** - Ok this is a huge one, and one that I don't really understand to boot. It is far too common that when I message a guy first, and I almost always do, the conversation dies off very, very quickly. I take the time to read the profile of the person I am messaging so that I can more easily add to the conversation and make it easy for them to do the same. This is where it's important to have that information available. Most times, I will receive a single word answer to an open-ended question, and no follow up. They respond when I send a message, but with very few words and no attempt to keep the conversation going, never ask questions, etc. Now one might think that they are just not very interested, except for the fact that they often ask why I stopped messaging them, seemingly unaware. It's because I am not into one-sided conversations where I have to do all of the work. It's a give and take. So guys, if this happens to you, compare your messages to the ones you are receiving. Are you asking her about herself too? Did you reference anything that was in her profile? I will admit it is different talking to someone in person than it is messaging over a website, I think it's a little more challenging and that's why conversational skills are that much more important for online dating. Learning about each other is going to be a little tedious and awkward at first, or at least it is IME until you get the usual niceties out of the way. Don't be afraid try and say a little more, it just gives us more to talk about.





5) **Read my profile** - There are a lot of reasons for this, but the biggest issue I have experienced personally is due to my status of being Child Free. I've lost count of the number of times a guy with children has contacted me, and then been surprised or angry when I say it's not going to work out. Had they paid attention to the obvious disclaimer on my profile, we could have both avoided wasting our time. This goes right along with #3. Do not omit the fact that you have kids and expect a CF person to suddenly be ok with it. You are setting yourself up to fail, and not to mention, it's a dick move.




So these are the five biggest issues I've witnessed quite a bit. If you've read up until this point I'd like to say thanks. I hope this helps everyone in their dating endeavors and hopefully lessens some of the more frustrating aspects of it. 



If there is something I left out or if you have something to add, please leave a comment. Thoughts and constructive criticism are welcome.



Edit: I'd like to add that this definitely applies to everyone, gender aside.

I would also love to add a couple of things in reference to taking good pictures. I personally use the lighting in my bathroom to take my best pictures. Make-up lights will do absolute wonders. Some residential bathrooms have them, it's the kind with several large, round bulbs usually at the top of the mirror or around the perimeter. I do my hair and put on my best outfit, then just play around with the front-facing camera on my phone. Truth be told, I will get one really good picture out of every 25 or more.

It was a thrill actually, imagining what this mystery woman looked like, this woman with whom I clicked so well in email conversation.  We're talking long emails that took hours to write.  I would get home from work giddy with excitement, anxious to go online and check and see if she replied.

822,7akdwz,False,None,45,Just Deleted my Dating Apps and I feel Great,dating,"I think at this point, it was time to throw in the towel. I've been on these apps since my breakup with my ex and a year and a half ago, and really had no success.

When I first started using the apps, I was naive. Everytime I got a match, I got a feeling of excitement. At this point, even if I get matched with a super attractive girl, I feel nothing because now I know better. 100% of my matches devolved into nothing, in one way or another. 

- Either they don't message you at all.
- They don't respond to your messages when you message first.
- They take days to respond (which is fine if they're busy, but more often than not it implies they don't care to speak to you and I just take the hint).
- They produce thoughtless responses that don't promote conversation.
- They don't want to go on a date.
- They accept the date and then flake.
- You go on the date and they suddenly ghost you afterwards.
- They are not ready for a relationship.

Yeah, sure, I've had great conversations with some girls -no doubt. But still, at some point in time the interaction ended with any of the points above.

Eventually this was starting to affect me in my daily life outside of these apps. Not because it didn't work out with girls specifically, but because it just killed any motivation about me to be excited about anything in my daily life. I felt like if something good happened to me, it would only be a matter of time before something disappointing would follow. As if to say I didn't deserve good things to happen to me, because that's what I was used to in my experience in these apps for the past year and a half.

I stuck with these apps just hoping for that ""one girl"" to surpass all these rest, but it never came to be. One could probably just say ""man up, rejection is part of the game "", but hey, it's not like I've been on these apps for just a week or two. A year and a half and nothing. Enough is enough. When I realized it got to the point where it's affecting my ability to get excited about good things in my life, the solution became obvious. So I deleted the apps.

Now obviously I'll have the thoughts like ""well, if I'm not on the apps now the 'one girl' can't reach out to me"", but it's this exact mindset that keeps me in this vicious loop of disappointment. Clinging on to an idea that really has proved to have no basis in my experience. If I'm going to find someone, it's going to be in person.

And now I feel great. I'm no longer wasting time spamming swipes, looking through superficial profiles. It feels great to not feed into the validation that some people use these apps for. 

This is not an attack about girls on the apps. Ladies, I know full well there are tons and tons of disappointing guys on these apps as well, I just can't speak to that from a personal experience. 

If any of you feel like this situation describes you, I definitely recommend just letting go. Seriously. Delete them and spend the time you would have spent swiping and analyzing profiles and do something that makes you happy instead.

We (21M & 19F)  matched on Tinder AND Bumble a week ago and I got her FB and Snapchat the next day, then set up a date for yesterday, Thursday.

 I don't feel that it's right to have a first date at someone house and especially if you are looking for something more than a hookup.

827,grl63n,False,Venting,37,"You might be the one pushing them away too, even if you are interested",dating,"Allow me to explain i’ve found out through therapy that you can push someone away with other kinds of behavior that’s not outright rejecting, ghosting or fading (even if you like them!). What happens is if i’m interested in someone by default i expect them to not like me back and subconsciously i try to push them away, i’ve observed my behavior and this is what i gathered.

-Overtexting and then pulling back in an attempt to seem chill, this just confuses the other person and makes them lose interest (Hot and cold behavior).

-Not being able to manage my body language, mine is very closed off and guarded, this has been very challenging to work on.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to answer questions or to  engage in a conversation in a personal way that allows the other person to know you better, so i come across again as either not interested or confusing (you can ask a lot of questions, yet not speak about myself and making it seem as if i’m closed off). This could be solved i think, by allowing yourself to let yourself be you, not what you think you should be and if your personalities don’t mesh at least you were honest.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to be physically receptive to flirting, like expecting them to do so but it reads as not wanting to be touched if that makes sense. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with having sex, but shutting off the sexual part of attraction (personally i don’t have sex unless i’m in a relationship), but what i mean is that i don’t initiate flirting making me seem like i’m not interested in physical touching.

-I never state that i’m interested and look for signs the other person doesn’t find me attractive or interesting, then i start backing off with no explanation, making them back off as well and thus making a cycle.

-I’m afraid that the moment that i start liking them and let my guard down i will hurt them/scare them with my affection, this is a big and tough one for me because i tend to get attached quickly (i hardly find anyone that i really like and tend to feel really strong about them) and i couldn’t advice someone on this because i don’t know exactly the reason behind it.

-Thinking i’m not interesting enough and that i should have a million hobbies to be even considered dateable, so it becomes an obsession with being perfect for the people i like and never let my true personality show.

-Trying to burn them out subconsciously by being clingy, then when they back off i feel really insecure and i don’t reach out to them, thus coming off as selfish or without a backbone.

Essentially i’m emotionally unavailable subconsciously, but it overlaps with my desire to be in a relationship, if you’re like me and feel like people pull away from you, really consider whether you’re pushing them away in ways you don’t know.

I  have recently moved to Canada and don't know anyone here really and  decided to give tinder a try to see how it goes(in the country i came  from it was really dry to say the least). Anyway, to my surprise girls  were more responsive and were willing t go out(I am not exotic or  anything like that). Went on a date with one girl, it was okay, really  formal, got ghosted after that. Went out with the second girl the next  day and we had a really good connection, touching each other and stuff  like that. Unfortunately she lives in a nearby town and only comes to my  town for work, and got a horrible disease recently that put her in a  hospital. We still chat but she doesn't have time to date, but i will of  course go out with her if she wants. Went out with one more girl, again  something was off but it wasn't bad, but we stopped talking. The final  girl i met at a bar, while the others were all at a cafe, and this girl  was really quiet. It was like i had to pull words out of her, maybe she  was nervous , but she messaged me later saying that i am a great guy but  she had no time due to work lol.

What  these 4 dates did for me is that they gave me a huge confidence boost  and that it's okay if it doesn't work out. But I still need to work on  my first impressions.

I always thought women just never approached but if we are truly the same then they must, it just never happens to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/djlupl/do_women_approach_men/,156,">I've heard that men and women are the same, that theres very little difference except for sexual anatomy.

Absolute non-sense,...that is just feministic political correctness. They are absolutely not the same.

>So my question is, do women approach men like we approach them?

In the way you are asking the question only the desperate and excessively aggressive women do that. Mentally and emotionally healthy women do not.

However in ways that you probably don't even comprehend the answer can be a ""yes"".

Women chase all the time and do it first,...but only when you understand what is going on.  Women initially chase all men at the same time,...but again, only when you understand the process. Women will then zero in on a single guy or small group of guys once they identify such, but again, only when you understand the process.

When a woman takes the time and puts in the effort to make her self look good she is trying to catch the attention of men. At first it is just generalized,..""all men"". But when a man or certain men get her attention she will continue to do so but will focus it more on them by how she directs her attention (maybe flirting) and how she puts herself in their ""orbit"".   She is somewhere nearby, or chooses to go to events and places where they are at.

All of that is a form of chasing, even though she doesn't go up and offer the guy a date. She is chasing in more of a passive way.

So when a guy responds to what she has presented to him and he approaches and then offers a date that is actually the 2nd and 3rd action.

Actions:

1. Woman makes herself as attractive as she knows how, puts herself in the vicinity, and focuses her attention on the guys she may be interested in.
2. A guy ""takes the bait"" and approaches
3. If the approach goes well he offers a date

Timid weak guys who don't know what they are doing fail miserably at #2 and #3 because they can not properly figure out #1 (among other reasons).  Their failure will drive some women to desperation where the woman feels she has no choice but to do all three steps herself. But if she gets a guy this way she often will become frustrated with him, lose respect for him, treat him harshly,...and eventually dump him.  The overly aggressive women are a whole different thing and that side of it is too much for me to try to get into. ",2019-10-18 11:01:07
830,9xwfig,False,Venting,65,I think I'm dead on the inside.,dating,"The current dating culture has made me super jaded.

1.) I'm not excited to go on dates anymore. It's the same thing over and over again. Getting to know someone...where they went to school, etc. I have to care, but deep down, I really don't. This person I'm getting to know can drop me in an instant...maybe even after this date and this effort will be wasted...again.

2.) Most of the girls I meet have some kind of trauma from their ex or something. Then I have debate if I want to continue or not.

3.) Related to 2, I don't feel all that bad about dropping a girl anymore. I send a politically correct message and try to be friends after. They mostly never want to talk to me again. Where is my friend zone? I don't mind making friends.

4.) I don't wait for/am not excited for a girl's response to my text anymore. If it never comes, I just assume she ghosted me. If she had in fact been hit by a car or something, I sure would never followup...so I'd never know. I don't even feel bad when a girl ghosts me anymore. It's business as usual. 

5.) If I ask a girl out and I'm rejected...I feel nothing. I don't even try to plead my case. She said no? Ok. Move along.

6.) I'm old. I used to worry about not being able to have kids, being alone for the rest of my life, etc. I just don't care about that anymore. I'd rather be lonely than be stuck in a bad relationship.

831,8ykopq,False,Venting,69,This sub has been toxic lately,dating,"I recently deleted my old profile on here because I just couldn’t deal with all the toxic people on this sub anymore. I cannot believe how many [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys), [r/incels](https://www.reddit.com/r/incels), etc. have infected this place. So many disgusting comments getting upvoted and decent, reasonable people being harassed and attacked for saying things like “no, women don’t owe you, or any guy, anything.”

I feel like the user base here is highly skewed towards “thirsty dudes looking for the magic secret to getting laid/getting a girlfriend,” and that unfortunately leads to a tendency for this crowd to default to always take a rejected guy’s side in any situation, regardless of context. Since they really want (and think they deserve… cringe) more chances in their own lives, “give the guy a chance” is always their default answer. I’ve seen tons of posts where a woman describes all kinds of creepy, cringe-y, stalker-y, even rape-y behavior… and oftentimes the mob *stil*l takes the guy’s side and attacks the woman for “being mean to the poor guy and not giving him a chance.” I see this kind of mentality other places around reddit too. Any time the obvious answer to how to deal with a shitty person engaging in all kinds of awful and inappropriate behavior is “don’t put up with it and kick them out,” a bunch of people will complain about how that’s “unfair,” and that it’s “immature” of them to not put up with other peoples’ bad behavior. Or they act like if someone is acting inappropriately and making everyone around them uncomfortable, that it’s somehow everyone else’s responsibility to teach another adult basic social skills (or be a “dating coach”). In light of this, I have to think that a lot of these people rabidly defending “the creepy guy” or “the friend no one likes” in these stories probably *are* “that guy” in their own social lives.

And the anti-ghosting crusade. Holy shit. All these emotionally unstable people act like the fucking sky is falling, the world is ending, and the art of civility and human connection is irreparably broken… because people occasionally don’t contact some random person they barely knew after going on a date with them. News flash, it’s not everyone else’s problem that *you* can’t take a hint and/or have attachment issues. People will often tell (or respond to) these stories where it was *very*obvious the other person wasn’t into them, and then act all confused because “they didn’t say those words exactly.” Then they will inevitably blame the other person (usually, the woman) for “not communicating.” Communication is a two-way street, and if you miss or ignore every single non-verbal way that someone is communicating that they don’t like you and are uncomfortable with you, that’s a failure to communicate and act in a socially appropriate way. As an adult, you shouldn’t *need* other people to tell you those things. “I didn’t know any better” is no excuse for acting like a creep.

And these same people who absolutely lose their shit over getting ghosted and rabidly attack anyone who *dares* tell them that “no, it’s really not that big of deal and you should get over it,” have the nerve to gush about what great gentleman they are and how they would totally handle rejection well… They can’t even take a stranger on the internet saying something they disagree with well.

I see a similar issue with guys posting creepy stories basically outlining how obsessed/fixated they are on some girl, sometimes to the point of stalking, and then viciously attacking anyone who points out that “you know, it’s pretty unhealthy to be that obsessed with someone you aren’t even dating or anything.” They’ll say all kinds of nasty things to anyone who dares criticize them… and then do the same “gush about how I’m such a gentleman and *definitely* not a stalker” routine.

One of the best pieces of advice my boss has given me is “you have to be able to step outside yourself and see yourself as an observer. You have to see yourself the way others see you.” And these cringe-y guys just don’t understand that. Throwing a tantrum because you got rejected, not called back, or dumped looks bad. Ranting about “how terrible all women are” because of one or two bad experiences in your personal life looks bad. Expecting some kind of gold star or “credit you can redeem for a wonderful girlfriend” for being a law-abiding citizen who is generally polite, has a job, a car, and your own place is laughable.

I have no desire or temperament for casual relationships/FWBs/ONS and I take dating seriously as a monogamous person - but I desire and require tons of freedom and space in a romantic partnership. My ideal set up is that of two committed, interdependent people: folks who have their separate hobbies, friends, and interests but enjoy life together and are loyal to each other. I'm an introvert and for the most part, I enjoy being single and have a pretty busy life. I don't like texting constantly and the most I can handle seeing my S/O in a week is three times top.

I've only had one real relationship and that was with someone who definitely *not* compatible with me in that sense. I've rejected all past (and subsequent) romantic opportunities at the first sign of clinginess from the other person. Frustratingly enough, I feel like all I encounter in the dating scene are guys who either want to hit-n-run or settle down ASAP and practically live inside each other's skins. The most ironic thing is that I seem to attract clingy men to me like a moth to a flame. (I suspect it's because I seem approachable and open-minded?) It's exceedingly rare that I'll meet someone with similar expectations as myself, and when I do there's no romantic compatibility.

For what it's worth, most of my dating nowadays is through online apps so that's probably why it's such a mixed bag. Friends and family have said it's because I just haven't found someone I'm crazy about, but I dunno. I know there's no real solution to this conundrum - nor am I the only one to ever experience it - but I felt like getting this off my chest! The struggle, is real.

On the bright side, that one dude who I saw eye-to-eye with but had no romantic connection?

I think you might find these ideas resonate with you a lot and you can maybe find groups of like minded people to talk to about this stuff or even people to date in those communities. Because I think 90% of people on this sub do not share similar ideals or views on dating from what I can see in a lot of replies.

So how does dating/girls fit in to this? The current dating climate is an extremely biased one in favour of females, nowhere is this represented more accurately than on Tinder. I have used Tinder in the past and it always made me feel dirty, like why do I have to think of a clever opening message in order to warrant a reply? 

I am not inferior, nor do I have to prove anything to you in the hope that you give me the grace of a response. Fuck that. 

And then there is the club scene. Personally I have enjoyed much more success/enjoyment from meeting girls irl when out, and had some fun. But today I was volunteering and chatting to a female colleague, we were discussing this topic and she said that she doesn't particularly enjoy getting approached by guys in clubs (she's actually a lesbian) but if she doesn't then it can damage her confidence when many of the other girls in the club are getting approached. 

I mean, I respect her honesty and I like her as a friend. But is this the female mentality nowadays with regards to guys? We are simply used as a tool for validation whether that be through a Tinder swipe/message or an approach in a club? 

Anyways, it kinda made me realise that I am doing a disservice to myself by chasing girls. Its empowering to live a life where you are improving social skills, making new friends, learning a language, getting stronger both physically and mentally, travelling etc. Its not empowering to chase girls in the hope that one of them will like you enough to date you.

And I reminded myself that there was no pressure because I could start out friendly and just see how we vibe. Yet I’d still get too scared to do it!

Went out with one girl. Boring as hell with no ambition to change her current situation. (No job. New to the city. Poly but has never kept a relationship over a year) 

Nah not for me. 

So this week I have a date on Friday with a guy and he is taking me into the city for some show and I’m excited for it. We’ve text over the past week and he seems pretty rad. 

But I am still seeing the 5~ month guy. He took me on a date this past weekend and honestly it was so much fun and just normal. But still no exclusivity. 

All in all. Keep your options open while dating. Hell 5~ months guy might change his mind and he might not but either way don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Shop around.

I can understand this behavior from women in their 20s, but I figured by the time they reached their 40s they may be a little more honest and forthcoming.

841,aj11aj,False,None,159,Tips for guys based from my experiences,dating,"Before I get destroyed, Let me preface this by saying this is MY opinion. Yes, I realize everyone is different. And yes I know guys prob do the same thing.

1) what girls say and do are different 

“I like when a guy constantly messages me. It shows he cares” (or some variation of this). No, they say this but when it happens they get scared, feel you’re going too fast, you’re clingy. And then they hit you with “I’m not ready. Still healing from blah blah blah.”

2) let the girls be the ones that move the relationship along. Just enjoy dating/sex until she brings it up. 

Don’t ask/say “What are you looking for?” “I really like/love you,” etc. See point #1. Sometimes girls might just want to have sex/fun at the moment but  feel like they can’t say that as an answer. In this case they will end it if they feel you want more. (She might change her mind after a some time being with you).

3) Tex her first (THE FIRST TIME). After that wait for her to initiate the conversations for a little bit.  Otherwise you’ll come off as desperate and she’ll be turned off since you’re an easy target for her. Once things start to get serious then start initiating texts/calls at a reasonable pace. (Also, don’t reply too fast (wait an hour or 3). But this is a per case scenario.

4) Have options! She sure does. This also helps you not obsessed (clingyness) over 1 girl. 

5) have a life outside of her. Hobbies! 

At the end of the day girls like their freedom and they like what they can’t have. If you’re constantly talking to her then she will feel trapped/smothered. 

I’m sure I have other tips but these are the ones on my mind right now. I’ve started having way more success since implementing these! Good luck!

Me, 31F, do get matches even from hot guys but guess what they mostly wanna hook up and I want a relationship. It always leads to Nowhere Land. I stopped swiping right on those IG  model guys because of that. I've tried the whole ""no sex unless I'm in a relationship"" for like 7 months after I broke up with my ex (we were together for 6 years). I didn't get sex. So when I couldn't take it anymore, I picked the hottest guy who cared to know more than my name and had decent conversational skills. Does that make me a shallow person? Maybe but honestly IDGAF. 

I told a guy last week on bumble, 99% of guys here are only DTF (yeah bumble is slowly turning into Tinder 2.0) whereas a lot of women want relationships. So if i have to settle for something that was not my original plan, then you best believe I'd pick a guy I find hot. That would be his one fucking job.

I want to talk to more people (especially girls) but I can't start conversations and have to wait until they talk to me - which happens once in a blue moon.

Online dating sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/a3jx2g/got_stood_up_tonight/,150,"One rule here is to try never to cancel a date / plans / hang out? (I'm old) with someone you know only through OLD.  There is no well of goodwill to draw from since she still does not know you.  I realise that we all have busy, movable schedules, but we will never know for sure whether changed plans are due to work or a bigger better deal.  After a guy rescheduling with me for the second time (see how generous I used to be), it came out that he was otherwise engaged.  so cancellations become red flags to others.

After that, make sure that plans are tight.  Date, time, place, activity are firmly set.  No ""calling to confirm / check in"" even a day before / of the date as that sometimes suggests to others that you are not quite all in.  My response to such a suggestion is ""we have everything we need finalized.  If you think something might come up, then let's dissolve plans now and you can call me later.""  Nor should you accept that kind of behavior from your date.

It's sad that she took the opportunity to stand you up.  although these days, I've had enough of this myself and I view late cancellations (day before / of) as the same as being stood up.  If you can manage your schedule and anticipate when you might be extra busy, then you should. Don't double book and don't overbook.  Know your limits.

I'm halfway through my 30s now, and the spot I'm in is where it's like of course I want to meet someone, but at this age, I get easily  exhausted at the thought of putting in a ton of effort only to realize there's usually little to no reward in it pertaining to resolving my dating life. It's almost as if there's more unnecessary stress and less courtesy when all you're trying to be is a human trying to genuinely connect with another human.

This is not being pessimistic either, but just a fact of how eventually dating wears me out easily at this stage.

B) Still had feelings for the last person I was with (over 6 months ago).

Though I couldn’t talk to him as much as I would have liked, he was attractive and it would still be something fun to do.

The first red flag was that he was twenty minutes late. I didn’t raise a fuss over it, as we wouldn’t have to sit through as many previews, but saw him eventually arrive in the building wearing sunglasses. Because he had a cap on as well, I was debating with myself whether or not it was him when he texted me from 100 feet away, “Over here”, rather than coming to me or even looking at me. I walked up to meet him, and he was dipping tobacco in his bottom lip. I stifled laughter as I tried not to think about the fact that he looked like a squirrel storing food, or the fact that his teeth were blackened with nicotine. At this point I was thinking “Fuck this” before we even reached the popcorn stand, but decided that I would have fun watching the movie anyway.

After the movie, he had to use the restroom and boredly placed his monster-sized Icee into my hand as he went into the loo. When he came out, he walked away from me without a word. I returned his Icee to him and did my best to make conversation; he barely made eye contact and it was considerably awkward. Think The Office.

I can’t stop giggling to myself at work, thinking about the big ass Icee and the whole situation. I wish him well, but it’s a no from me. I see it as a great lesson in taking things like this in stride and having a good chuckle about it. It was an experience at best.

He seemed great, we met up the day we matched and genuinely had such a good time together, he was constantly complimenting me on how amazing he thought I was. He was extremely mature and respectful to me, treated me insanely well. He goes to a military academy (supposed to be a ""man"" of **~honor~**, right) and just recently graduated, so I couldn't see him for two weeks because he had to quarantine but we had planned out a great overnight trip together to get to say goodbye to one another. 

He talked to me constantly every single day, asked me how my day was going, what I was up to, all the like. Was genuinely invested in having conversations with me, telling me how he was so excited to see me, planning our trip, etc. 

Tonight I bought him beers to celebrate his graduation and have been prepping/getting excited to see him for the past two weeks. 

The trip was tomorrow morning. 

And you know what just happened? 

**He blocked me on every social media platform and when I texted him to ask what was up, he sent me paragraphs about how he was having issues related to his ex and he felt like a horrible person for hooking up with me when we first met and that he wants to change. I explained to him that this absolutely was not acceptable and he basically told me he hated himself and that he was extremely sorry. He tried to explain himself and ask for forgiveness because he didn't want to hurt me and thought blocking me would be the best way to do it.**


Sure, I didn't know him long. I'll get over it. But to have someone lead me on all day every single day for two weeks, to get so excited for a trip, to buy him congratulatory beer and watch his (very long) graduation because he asked me to, only to have him do this?

I gave him FOUR chances (two of them today) to back out of our plans. He chose THE most cowardly option. 

We went back and forth for a bit but I've been on delivered for a while so I think he may have blocked my number as well.

I’m a 29F who got into this last lease with my ex fiancé (broke off last June) after trading my fully paid car off for it. The lease fell on me as it was in my name and I have barely been able to afford it on my own. Fast forward back to tonight, she asks me if my new boyfriend will be paying for my new car.

870,8cllmi,False,Giving Advice,24,Some important advice for lonely singles,dating,"I've been spending the past 2 months trying to get over a girl that broke my heart. She played me for a fool and used me for emotional support and intentionally kept me around while she was out chasing another man and as soon as he was willing to take her back, I was last weeks garbage. I felt distraught and like thr whole world was against me. I couldn't trust people, I couldn't sleep right, and every day I saw her was like a kick in the head. She had me under her thumb no matter what and I lived day to day praying that she would reconsider.

But then I realized something...my self-worth. I started thinking about how a woman that would intentionally play with people's emotions like that isn't someone that deserves my love and affection and certainly not my time. I realized that anyone who rejects me is missing out on something amazing and any girl that breaks up with me is losing the ""greatest good they're ever gonna get"" (5 points if you get the reference).

I also realized that I can't live my life trying to be someone that I'm not. I sat around trying to become the ideal man and ""Chadify"" myself in an attempt to make my chances with women better instead of just being myself and loving me! I love anime and retro video games and terrible movies and netflix comedies! Nobody can take that away from me and anyone who tries is a waste of my time. I refuse to hide my loves for the sake of those who didn't appreciate them to begin with.

It's not always easy to make a move and change your life or your mindset, but all it takes is one change to turn around your entire life. Today, I went out and got a haircut and a bunch of new clothes, completely changing my look. Now, I love the way I look. I ended up texting a girl that I think is cute that I work with asking to get lunch later this week and lo and behold, she was pretty happy about the idea. That's just an example of how being confident and going after what you want, whether it'll work or not, is incredibly important.

This is for everyone who is going through some pain and feels like nobody likes you or that you'll be alone forever; first, there are people that like you that you'll never know about unless you talk to people and read their body language. Second, it just takes time. Don't rush it and don't put people up on pedestals as though they're unattainable. You never know who may have a hidden crush on you!

Long story short, love who you are. Love what you like. Embrace it and even display it! More importantly, don't let people walk all over you!

I've been perusing this sub on and off for years, as I've attempted to float in and out of the dating games for past decade. 

As I've mentioned in the title of this post; there are so many submissions that are consumed by negativity: ""I'm giving up!"", ""There's no one out there for me?"", ""Why even bother?"", ""Women/Men are so ""X"""". These are common statements you'll see creep up pretty much daily. And as someone who came from that head space, I GET IT! For the past 10 years of my life, I gave it an honest effort to try and get into the dating game. I was a nerdy, socially awkward, introverted, person. Years of flirting, unsuccessful attempts in asking someone out and getting shot down... by the end of it all, I was jaded, defeated, and honestly thought, ""Fuck it why bother, this is bullshit"". I remember in University, one of the strategies I used to try and help me get used to rejection, was if I randomly saw a cute girl, I'd politely approach them, and say something like, ""Hey, sorry to bother you, but I just had to ask, would you be interested in grabbing coffee or tea with me sometime?"". I think I asked something like 20-30 random girls, and I got shot down almost every single time. I remember downloading Tinder, and Bumble, and trying that out; I seemed to make 0 progress no matter how *""hard""* I tried, so as you can imagine, by the time I was getting into my late 20's, I fell into that same dark place.


But here's the thing guys, when has there ever been **ANYTHING** in this world that was actually **WORTH** something, not required some hardship, and effort?


I took a couple years and forgot about dating, forgot about the negativity it brought forth into my life, into my defeatist attitude, and I focused on what made me happy. I got into the best shape I had ever been with regular exercise and a good diet, I played the video games I enjoyed with friends, and had a blast doing it! I decided to join a sports league at my local gym, something a bit out of my comfort zone, but something I had always wanted to try, I saved up some money and traveled solo. I can genuinely say, the past few years of my life, I woke up every single day happy. It's so easy to get lost in the echo chamber of negativity when it comes to dating, and that does nothing good for you, but spread that negativity into your life, and as a result it can absolutely effect that which you're working so hard towards. As humans, we have a natural desire for intimacy, social interaction, to be loved, and to love, so it's natural to focus on it. But when it begins to consume you, it WILL become a problem.


You know the typical response, *""focus on your own self-improvement, and dating will happen!""*


It took me years to realize this, but the reason isn't because a Man or Woman will randomly fall into your lap the more you focus on yourself, and your own improvement. It's because everyone can sense negativity, and positivity. If you are honestly, and truly satisfied and happy with your own state of being, EVERYONE around you can see it, and sense it. Likewise, when you're drowning in desperation, negativity, and defeatism, everyone around can tell. And that absolutely effects your dating life. Would you want to be involved with someone, whose sole purpose of happiness is based off singular need to be with someone? Who otherwise is not happy with their life, and spreads negativity throughout themselves and others? My guess is probably not.


I literally did nothing but spiral downwards and spin in place for over a decade before I realized this wasn't helping me, or anyone else. I focused on me, improving myself, learning new things, enjoying what millions of things life had to offer. Now, at 30 years old, when I attempted to get back into dating, guess what happened? I met someone. She's beautiful, smart, funny, when she laughs... I completely melt. I didn't try to change who I was, I still do the same nerdy things I did before, but I made sure to focus on my life, and really, truly become happy. And not only did it totally change my perspective on dating, but I can honestly say I felt complete... And now I have someone to share that happiness with. 


I know there are some of you who are older than me, and some of you who are younger, some which have had better luck at dating, and some with worse. But I guess the moral of this post is:


**TL;DR:** Don't get lost in negativity, don't give up, truly seek happiness and self-improvement, and others will want to share and enjoy that positivity with you. This life has so much to offer us, and dating is such a small part of it. Spread happiness and positivity to those around you <3.

I feel so completely and utterly lonely, and it's made worse by all my family and friends having someone. Fuck, though, dude, dating just sounds like a miserable experience. Especially since online is pretty much my only option. 

I still remember the last time I tried. It was shortly after me and my ex broke up. We had been dating for a month so I had been spared the bullshit for a bit. Jumping right back into that bullshit for 2 days had me all like, ""Man, fuck this."" You've always gotta come up with some clever opener 🙄, and then you feel like some dancing monkey who has to walk on eggshells while juggling chainsaws. 1 wrong word, 1 wrong use of punctuation, 1 mistake whatsoever, and she's gone. You finally get to where she says 'yes' when you ask her if she wants to go do something, but 9/10 times she just ghosts you when the time draws near. You're always having to compete with a million other guys, and they have the advantage of not being mentally handicapped. 

The kicker is that that is the easy part. When you meet her in person is when your dancing monkey act had better be spot-on. Unfortunately, my act definitely needs some work (on my first date of my life I asked a girl if she had any neighbors while I was holding a knife). I'm always super fuckin nervous. That's too bad, because it's all about first impressions, and I'm someone you've got to get to know first. If you suck at job interviews you will suck at dating as well.

Anyone else feel the same way? I'd really love to have someone I could spend some time with. Shit, but dating? No, way, dude.

If online dating feels like a drag, give it a break. It does feel like an endless swiping and messaging cycle sometimes.

881,cryk8i,False,I Need Advice,49,How to disclose a disability in online dating?,dating,"Okay! Backstory: 
I’m a woman in my mid-20s and to look at me, you wouldn’t know I am legally blind. That is, I have lots of functional sight (I can read, recognize people up close, etc.), but I’ll never recognize you from across the room, I can’t drive, and I walk into things, like walls and other people, a lot. I don’t use my cane as often as I should (even though it helps) because it makes the people around me act in bizarre and obnoxious ways, and I generally appear to have much more sight than I actually do. I can get away with “faking it.” My friends, family, and partners often forget I can’t see.
But, I’m getting a guide dog soon! I’m over the moon about it, but unlike a cane, I can’t fold up a dog and stuff him in my purse when the reactions of others become inconvenient.

Actual question: 
When it comes to dating strangers (usually online), I’ve always refrained from mentioning my sight until well into the first date, at the very least. I don’t mind disclosing, but I’ve found that even the most well-intentioned people have strange ideas about disability, and especially blindness, that I don’t want projected onto me before I have a chance to prove that I’m a fairly normal, aggressively independent person.
With a dog though, my normal “fake it” routine is being derailed. So, how do I bring up the “blind thing,” which I can no longer hide, without coming across as high maintenance? Particularly in online dating, how should I mention this? Would it be an immediate turn off? Should I include my cane or my harnessed dog in pictures and wait for them to ask? Should it be in my bio? Few people will actually say “I don’t date disabled folks,” but a majority of the population would rather not deal with it. The minority who prefer it tend to like “vulnerable”  people and are creepy as hell, and I certainly don’t want to attract that type more than I already do. 

TL;DR: I usually wait to tell people I’m visually impaired, but with a guide dog, I won’t be able to postpone that conversation. How do I bring up the “blind thing,” which I can no longer hide, without coming across as high maintenance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cryk8i/how_to_disclose_a_disability_in_online_dating/,135,"i mean if you got a pretty face and a fat asa, most of us dont really care.. you're good ",2019-08-18 08:04:55

884,abvvbg,False,None,87,What do YOU bring to the (dating) table?,dating,"It seems like the past 2-3 weeks there has been a significant amount of posts along the same lines - asking for help:

​

- men/women who are 28-70+

- no dating or sexual experience

- never had a girlfriend/boyfriend

​

We all have different upbringings, and I realize that many people struggle with family probs, mental health issues, lack of employment, financial hardships, weight issues, etc. But the common goal for most in this sub is to find LOVE! To have someone care about you, accept you, and to have sex with is a human desire that is not easy for some to find, it may elude others for years, and some it may never happen for. I see the same advice on 'repeat' in all of the posts by these people, although I respect that they reach out and want to change and find love, there HAS to be some accountability. SO IF you fit in this category, please take note:

​

Saying ""I want to find a girlfriend/boyfriend"" sounds fine and dandy, but what can YOU do for a girlfriend/boyfriend? I think a lot of people really believe that because they have a desire to have someone to love them, they see others their age with someone, or they just want to not be a virgin - that is enough. It isn't. Past the age of 25, most adults have goals: they work, they are supporting themselves, they are independent. And past the age of 30, some adults are looking to settle down and start families. BE HONEST and take stock in what you have to bring to the table. Can you be/do all of those thing? Can you hold down a job and support yourself OR if it happens, a family? Can you pay bills? Grocery shop? Cook and clean? The very basics of living alone. Are you a fun person, interesting, not a bore? Can you afford to date? Not all things cost money, but for the most part they do...think about that kind of stuff. Notice I didn't say you have to be rich, have a high paying job, or a luxury car?! That's because that is a misconception. Being independent does not equal being rich. Don't confuse the 2 and use that as an excuse.

​

To get people to be attracted TO you, you have to BE attractive to others. If you aren't coming to the table with anything...outside of ""Im a nice guy/girl, I love to make people laugh, I care about others, blah blah blah..."" then you cannot expect someone who does bring more, to want to come to YOUR table with you. That isn't fair to either of you. 

​

Take the time to learn the social norms and graces. Please! This is no dig at anyone per se, but rest assured that if you are over the age of 25 and men/women continue to reject you, don't pay you any mind, or tend to ghost you repeatedly - it is something you are doing. The older you get without practicing your communication and approach skills IRL (not just online), the more awkward your personality will be - I don't care what your friends and family tell you. They are there to love you, not tell you the harsh truth. You can workout, have a great job, and your own place - but if your personality isn't developed, you are extremely awkward, some of you may be creepy, and aren't able to pickup on social cues or body language, do yourself and others a favor and take some time to learn. Put your wish to date on hold a bit, Get a therapist, get a life coach, get a dating coach, volunteer (with other people not animals or alone - so you can practice communicating)...take steps to improve YOU. People tend to smell desperation the minute someone starts talking, and there is nothing more creepy then a grown person who says off the cuff or weird things (or acts that way) because they have no clue what they are doing or how to do it. So give yourself the advantage by learning how to effectively speak to the opposite sex. Learn how to socialize. If you have anxiety or are socially inept, that's ok. Be open to advice and WORK on it. Not everyone has love fall in their lap out the sky. Don't fallback on it as a reason not to try to change. You want to be loved - do the work. 

​

The point of this is to say: IF you need a step-by-step playbook on all things 'dating' (from A-Z), then the typical post of ""I'm a 30yr old virgin, never dated, and I want to start now"" will NOT get you the results you want in this sub or in reality. I promise you that. That's why the advice in all those posts are the same thing...over and over. PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME NOR THE PATIENCE TO HOLD YOUR HAND AND WALK YOU THROUGH EACH STEP IN GETTING ATTENTION, I'm sorry. Professionals get paid to do that, so find one to help you! Do your own research, proactively take steps to help yourself first. Go out and practice. You will fail, yes, like a baby learning to walk, but keep trying. If your mental health has always been a struggle, don't ignore that as important..it is. If you give up you can't expect results...good or bad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/abvvbg/what_do_you_bring_to_the_dating_table/,137,What qualifies you to help anyone in dating? ,2019-01-02 18:08:06

Also, being able to have more endurance and being able to last longer not only in bed but on activities such as hikes, bike rides, walks, etc. Those used to be 100% avoided date ideas but it opens up a realm of new date spots now that I dont get winded after 10 minutes of walking down a trail lmao.

You should go and just ask her out, and if she says no, either stay friends if you already are friends, or lessen your contact with her

Trust me, it's better to let her know how you feel and find out how she feels about you, rather than trying to decipher her actions in the hopes that she's hinting something.  In my opinion, that's just going to hurt **you**.

Yes, I know it'll hurt, and there's going to be some ""facing the music"" initially, but eventually you'll move on.  As others say, there are other girls out there.

**PS**: this is also a reminder for me because I really liked the girl I asked out, and there is still some residual hurting, if that makes sense.

Go dead ass silent (literally don’t say anything or make a fuss... this does take a shit ton of self control and tact) and then you’ll see their true intentions... if they really care at all. I did that about 3 weeks ago and I haven’t heard from him since. I was confused for weeks, if not months about him because we had so much attraction and amazing sex. He even told me I was the best, gave the best head, I’d always think of him and grab food before I come over and even paid for our second date. If I could create a boyfriend for me, it would be him (goal oriented, hard worker, goofy, big downstairs lol). It really sucks when you want someone so badly, but you have to put logic before your feelings no matter how disappointing it is. 

Also, in my situation, if I reached out or asked him to hang... I always got a response instantly and was always a yes to hang out. It’s confusing and makes it harder to say “hey you’re just giving me the bare minimum” without sounding crazy, because they will just come back and make it seem like you overthink things. In my case, even though he told me he liked me and is very attracted to me there were a couple times he mentioned we could just be friends when I’d react emotionally (instead of being comforting or trying to work through things). If you pay attention, they may even tell you directly they aren’t ready to date or something, so don’t overlook it. Just listen to your gut. If it doesn’t feel right, then it’s not right. 

I saw a comment on a YouTube video that said girls get confused with this dynamic of overthinking and not understanding mixed signals, because we usually are the ones playing hard to get if we like a guy... but if a guy is doing it, it doesn’t mean the same thing and you should actually take it as he’s not as invested or interested enough.

He told me he trusted me and even went on to tell me some personal issues that he didn’t have to tell me but I encouraged him to if he felt the need, which he did. It seemed as though he was taking me seriously, and I was taking him seriously despite the eventual hookup.

Anyways, he messaged me a couple days after saying that he fell for someone back in his home town before moving out here, and that he thought he had moved on and was ready to date but realized he wasn’t. He said he has feelings for me and doesn’t want to hurt me in any way, but that he didn’t want to waste my time. I was obviously pretty upset because he was the first guy in a long time that I could actually get along with and felt comfortable with. All he really said was that he needed time to himself... I can’t help thinking that it was something to do with me??

Not that this is some new advice that’s never been dispensed before, or even something clever. As a matter of fact, I’ve seen many people suggest this before. I just want to reiterate how important and effective this is: Go out by yourself!

Go to the bars by yourself. Go to shows by yourself. Go to coffee shops and read by yourself. Go for walks, do this, do that, and do it by yourself.

First of all, it will help you get comfortable in your own skin. The first few times might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it’ll pass the more you do it. You’ll notice over time that you’re more approachable, and you will find that you’ll be more confident in approaching others. It all comes down to enjoying your own company out in the open. 

For me, it was going to the bars by myself when I realized how easy it really was to meet people. And also, don’t be afraid of getting friend zoned. Actually, it’s a good thing to think friends first. Value your new friend as a person and not as a potential companion. If you value them and their time, it may turn into something more, or they may be able to recommend you to one of their friends. 

Go out by yourself with the intention of just being social and increasing your social network. This will build confidence and attraction, and before you know it, you may have someone pining over you.

But a couple weeks went by and she reached out to apologize about how she treated me and said she wished we hadn't met yet because she really liked me but just wasn't ready for a relationship. We talked it out a bit and I came to the conclusion that it was done, we both didn't want the same thing at that time. Which, is understandable, it stings but at least now I knew and there's some closure, which is seemint rare these days.

Couple months go by and she reached out again wanting to hangout, I accepted. I did really like her, and I hadn't yet met anyone else. Went well for a couple weeks before she became evasive and had off excuses again. We went down the same road as before and it ended pretty much the same way. This cycle happened 4 times last year. Each time she seemed more sincerely apologetic. 

At any rate we broke it off again right before the holidays/new years. She tried to start it up again near the end of January. Essentially I asked her what the hell she actually wanted with me because it obviously wasn't a relationship (Which I'm pretty sure I made it clear that's what I wanted) or even just sex (She always turned me down when I tried to get intimate) and I was done being strung along for no reason.

Didn't get a reply and haven't heard from her since. And it shouldn't piss me off it at this point but it kind of does; literally two days after that she is officially in a relationship on Facebook with some new dude, taking pics together and posting them on all social medias. Which is something she never did with me. Always taking pics of us but never posted any of it. 

Now, I'm not nieve enough to believe she had just met this guy in two days time, but her sister (who was on my side and thought we were great together) had always told me she was never seeing anyone else but had been on dating apps in between, as was I. But it's still definitely a blow to my self esteem to be told not ready for a relationship after a year of this and then as soon as I deny her, boom she's in a relationship. ",2020-03-14 20:23:19
919,e7vo9e,False,Giving Advice,46,Red Flags to Look Out for in Online Dating,dating,"I (25M) am by no means an expert in online dating but here are some of the red flags I have found that can help you screen out people:

1. If you are the one asking all of the questions and they NEVER ask anything about yourself. I have found that these individuals don't want to get to know you by text and don't turn out to be much better in person either.
2. Take really close note of their pics. Ex: I am not a huge drinker and therefore if a woman has three pics of herself out with friends at a party this is a clear sign we probably won't work out.
3. If someone's opener is anything in the ""hey"", ""sup"", ""hi"" ballpark then they are probably not going to be a great conversationalist. I have maybe found one woman who bucks this trend but for the most part this will hold true. 
4. If they are flaky over a chat they are likely to be flaky in real life as well.
5. People who tell you more in their profile tend to be the ones who care more. This may seem obvious, but many people still try to pursue that cutie who has nothing other than his or her name on their profile. I have found that people who want you to know them better will give you more info off the bat

I recently spent 5 months in Chile and developed a 4 month long casual relationship with a university student there (I’m also a university student). When I left we discussed her coming to the US to visit me and my family. She’s been very excited about it, and has no doubts we should do it. She cried for hours after I left.

After getting back, I’ve been doubting in more and more. She’d be with my family and I for about 10 days. I also recently went on a date with another girl which ended in some making out and well... hand stuff.

Update:

I told her not to come. She cried over FaceTime again, and I told her it wasn't fair if I wasn't as invested, she deserved more than I could give her right now. She said I thought about the future too much, but I was really just thinking about my present self.

931,bcps8l,False,Giving Advice,28,Taking Time Out: Thoughts and lessons after a year off from dating,dating,"Hey peeps. So as the title prefaces, after trying out online dating late 2017 for the first time and calling it a day after just two months I [23M] decided that I didn’t like myself, my life and my personal relationships. It was then I decided that I would take a year out from the weird world of dating to get myself to a place that I would be happily single. 

Taking this decision wasn’t easy. A friend just a little bit older than me got engaged at a similar time. It’s too easy to descend into the old enemy, the sunk cost fallacy. “If I just keep trying, someone somewhere will want to be with me”. Sound familiar? It’s something I was thinking near constantly nearing the point of making the decision to have a break. It was becoming an obsession. In the morning I was swiping, messaging and researching so I could become the “ultimate catch”, at night I was upset that it wasn’t happening. In truth, I was losing myself. The ghosting, the chats that never went anywhere, all of the very real issues with dating were damaging my mental health. In reality, I wasn’t mentally ready. My relationships with friends were breaking down, my work was restructuring and in truth, I was lonely.  So lesson 1: don’t lose yourself to a relationship you don’t have yet. Know when to stop. It can be 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, however long since you started. If it’s making you question your worth, stop. You’re worth more than that.

I’m not going to lie, the first few months were difficult. There was so much I wanted to do but nothing was happening. I went to get therapy for issues I’ve had since childhood but I was on a waiting list for a long while. I was trying to force change, just like I was trying to force attraction. I had to learn to just let it happen. Work hard when you need to, but don’t try too hard at the cost of your mental health. I should point out at this point that nothing I’ve done have improved my dating skills. They’ve just helped me become a better version of myself, and get the support network and the skills to look after myself better. This makes me feel better about myself and makes it easier for me to put an honest version of myself out there without fear. I got new hobbies, things that my childhood self would think I was amazing for doing. Your past version is the only person you need to compare yourself to. The best thing is that I gained new friends doing these things. Surrounding yourself with great people gives you a crashmat for potential heartbreak. Cultivate your existing and new relationships. That’s another lesson. 

I also made sure I hit the gym. It’s a cliche, I know. It just works though. You feel better about your body and the endorphins boost your mood. If you’re like me and compare yourself to other people, going to a public gym kick you out of that habit. You get used to people. They’re doing their thing and you should do yours.

I don’t have any fairytale endings like “And now I’m in a relationship!!!” because that was never the goal. I had a date last week that didn’t as well as I’d hoped. I’m still a bit sad about that. The goal though was to build a life I’m proud of. And I am. My career has never been better. I have hobbies that I love and get me around great people. I’ve consistently hit the gym which has improved my mood and body confidence. I’ve got therapy which has helped me accept myself for who I am. Dating is tough, make no mistake. There will be times when you go to sleep sad, you wake up sad and nothing seems to get anywhere you want. That’s the truth. But that’s just some of the truth. You want a relationship because you have love to give. To give love you must have love. To have love you need pride in who you are and what you are all about. Then, it’s just a case of time.

It’s a bit of a ramble, but I hope it shows that when someone says for you to take a break from dating, it’s not wasted time. In fact, I found it to be the most fulfilling time I’ve had in years.

TLDR: Don’t lose your soul to the online dating gods. Take time out if you need it. It may be the best thing you do.

Edit! Thanks for all your wonderful comments and sharing your own experiences. It’s been a treasure for me to read through them and reply today. Look after your brothers and sisters peeps. 

One more thing, u/kevin_r13 has left another and, in my opinion, completely doable alternative for those who want to keep dating and improving.

932,aq4ej7,False,None,109,My super handsome friend is often rejected because of his origins,dating,"One of my friends is originally from Syria (he was born and grew up there, but he left Syria when he was 15). He then lived in Switzerland and moved to the Uk for University. He left Syria with his family long before the war, and so he has nothing to do with it. I have known him since he moved to the UK. He is very handsome and attractive (he looks exactly like Maluma). He has been facing a lot of problems just because of his origins. Since he is attractive and doesn’t have a typical Middle Eastern appearance, people in general and girls in particular approach him a lot in parties and clubs thinking he is Spanish, Italian, or Brazilian. However as soon as he tells them about his origins, they just leave him and their interest in him fades away. He had a lot of problems with dating. Girls would go out with him once and then when they learn about his origins, they would stop talking to him. Same story happens on Tinder. When we go out and socialise with people, sometimes things get worse. Some people would ask him where is he from and as soon as he mentions Syria, people would start asking him questions about the war, when is he going back, and how did he arrive to the UK. Some people were even rude to him and said things like “are you a refugee”, “did you come here on a boat”, and “why didn’t you stay”. Some people and particularly girls said racists things to him like “I don’t do Arabs”, “you’re too hot to be Arab”, “sorry I thought you were Italian when I gave you my number”, and “oh how come? You don’t look like those poor refugees”. He recently decided to not go out anymore, and he is isolating himself and avoiding all social encounters. Recently, I managed to convince him to go out with us few times but I noticed that he was avoiding to introduce himself to new people. If we meet new people in the bar or the club, he would step back and pretend to be on his phone or go to the bathroom. He doesn’t want to face the question of “where are you from”. He is smart, well-educated, goes to one of the best schools in the UK, and speaks English fluently in addition to three other languages. What do you people think?

I matched a guy and we texted a little. He preferred talking on the phone, and I don't. But then, I agreed only because I was low on battery and knew this call won't last long (win!). Later that night, we spoke till the morning. Giggling and connecting like we had been best friends for years. We decided to meet the same day, and it was great. We spoke constantly for the next few days. He formally asked me out again, and told me he'd really like to take me out on another date. He used the word ""date"" which is a dying word nowadays. I was excited and when we went to the beach at night. We walked and talked, and there came a moment when I asked him about his family. He spoke about it openly, but shut down right after. When he was dropping me home, he warned he may shut down because of that conversation, and I said it's okay. Take your time & call me whenever. He flirted with me, held hands through the date. I walked away feeling a deeper connection with him at this point, BUT hr called the next day, and literally went from hi to ""I'm sorry I'm not ready for a relationship. I really like you and am attracted to you, so would you like to be friends with benefits or we could just be friends too"". After taking in what he said, I said a firm ""No. I'm not looking for fwbs"" and hung up. I was confused for a while, so I called him again the next day, and you could tell he's being awkward now. I didn't care now. I had called to tell him, I didn't even want to be friends with him.  He was shocked about this, even sounded a little hurt. He tried convincing me otherwise, but I wished him luck and hung up.

The whole thing was very confusing, but the feeling to throw away something before it rots made me feel so good and powerful. It was like cleaning up your room, and creating space after having thrown all things unnecessary. It's sad how much time we spend hanging onto people in hope and expectations.

It's pretty simple: there's no such thing as someone being ""too busy"" for something that they genuinely want.

If all you get is excuses when it comes time to meet up, then newsflash: they're not that interested in you. For the sake of hope and not giving up we give benefits of doubt and make the excuses valid so as not to feel hurt or bad about that fact that the person we're interested in isn't interested in the same way, but that's what it is.

If they're really that busy at a specific point in time where you don't get to meet up, then they'll offer a rescheduled date when they know they'll be free because again, people will pursue the things they really want, so if someone really wants you, they'll find a way to make it happen.

Dating is very simple when you look at it the right way. Don't over read actions and words because everyone is different in what those words and actions mean. What you need to observe is the over all feeling of someone. If you get a ""hint"" that someone doesn't like you back, they don't. If someone is ""acting"" clingy, they are. Simple as that.

This one guy I met in person (but hadn't spoken much with then) just is not a quick-witted man, and I love quick-wittedness in a guy. I hadn't really texted with him much until yesterday, and my lord, like walking through mud.  I'm more of a goofy person/texter and love the same.  I came up with a plan of something to do that was more light-hearted and would give us a chance to talk. Planless before,  he all of a sudden wanted to go somewhere else to a loud club.

As of now, I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm going with him to this club this weekend although I did not agree and no plans were specified. I'll be at a dance class instead. 

What is up with these dudes though? Lack of social skills? This guy is in a career that requires a high level of intelligence, so he has to have some level of smartness. All I know is that I feel exhausted after just one day of talking to this recent dude, and I'm going to do a catch and release here. 

EDIT: All right, so a summary here. I grew up homeschooled in an abusive home with no access to the outside world (censored). I can see how it looks like I'm ragging on the dude,  but as I often tell my counselor, I feel like I didn't see many different models of human behavior.  When I see something I don't understand, I want to know *why?*

Thank all of you for your responses.  It helped me better understand some things. 


1) I was kind of emotionally exhausted after texting him and couldn't figure out why. Realized it was because he was marching all over my suggested plans (after he did not suggest any plans) and was demanding only his way. At first, I thought he was just awkward but then he got kind of obtuse.


2) He texted me some other things that made me feel like he was nervous and covering for his nerves by being really macho and controlling.


3) A surprising number of you are really fixated on the fact that he probably has sex despite his lack of social skills....which is kind of odd to bring up; is incels leaking?

I also can feel a bit insecure about my looks... I’m 30 now and I know I don’t look like a 20 year old anymore. I don’t put a ton of makeup on and so my photos are more natural looking. I don’t think I’m ugly but sometimes I feel like my face isn’t feminine enough or something.

Knew something was weird when he legit waited for me while I was taking pics with my friends. Gave him my alternative number and texted him a bit. Seemed cool. Wanted to hang out and talk so I agreed on Tuesday evening at the mall. We did and the convo went okay. I already noticed red flags like how he mentioned he would put a recorder under his bed to see if the ex was cheating as well as well as wait at her work to see also. He then asked if I was talking to anyone else. Told him I was just meeting people bc I was tired of the consistent hurt. He then said he would keep me and how he feels a connection (red flag).

So we went back to this car..and he wanted to kiss. I told him no, that I barely know him and how I don't kiss on the first date. He kept asking like four times...and asked what book I was reading that said I had to not kiss on the first meet (red flag). I told him how I'm not easy. He was like, wow you're putting a wall.

946,8o8hxg,False,Advice,6,Know when to fight and when to move on.,dating,"This is a reminder to anyone who might be dating right now, including me (like a note to self). 

Before you start getting serious with anyone or even when you’re already in a relationship with someone, make a list of your negotiables and non-negotiables.

Negotiables - Things you would prefer to have in a partner but you can do without. Traits that you can compromise on without feeling too bad about it. Example: tall, older/younger, master’s degree (this is all up to you, these are just samples)

Non-Negotiables- The important bit. Traits in your partner that if they didn’t have it, would drive you absolutely crazy. Lack of any of these traits will endanger your relationship. There is no way you can compromise on these aspects of the relationship. Example: loves dogs, loves children, vegan (again, these are just samples and will totally depend on your taste)

Do you have the lists done? Good. Now review that list. Make sure you have everything right. Make sure that what you listed are things you are absolutely sure of.

Are you sure now? Good. Now date.

Every time something pops up that unsettles you, go back to your list. Is it negotiable? Non-negotiable?

If it’s negotiable, learn to give in. If it’s something you can put up with or something you can do without, try to compromise. Don’t end a relationship over something you don’t mind letting go. 

Don’t argue for the sake of arguing and don’t let your pride take over. You could be giving up something good for something so small.

If it’s non-negotiable, stand your ground. Remember, this was non-negotiable for a reason. You said you needed this because you couldn’t bear to be in a relationship without it. Sometimes, when we fall in love, we keep giving even at the expense of our own well-being and peace of mind. Don’t do it. Learn to say no when it’s on things that mean much to you. 

I’ve seen so many people give everything to someone who couldn’t care less. I have seen people do things they normally wouldn’t do all in the name of “love.” I wasted three years on a guy who promised me the world but couldn’t follow through with even our dates.

948,fr92x0,False,Tinder/Online Dating,62,"Walked out on my dinner date, could I have handled it better?",dating,"I (22M) had matched with a girl (19F) and we agreed to meet up for some sushi the following night. She seemed friendly over text, and we had no real issue talking about our interests and hobbies. But I’m not the kind of person that likes to text too much before meeting up because I prefer talking to someone in person. 

This is for a few reasons:

1. To see what they sound like and if their tone matches the way they text. A lot of people are great at texting, but when it comes to in person socializing, they can turn into a wall.

2. I can see what they’re body language is like. Even if they sound interested, their body will often show if they actually are or not through things like posture and contact.

3. Finally, to see how they treat others in a public space or forum such as restaurant wait staff. I believe how someone acts towards another that can give them nothing in return shows the type of person that they are.

I could very well be over analyzing, but this is the first time where as time went on, there were more and more red flags/instances that eventually led to me walking out.

Initially, we agreed to meet at the restaurant at 6:30 pm. I text her earlier after I finished work around 3 pm letting her know that I’m looking forward to dinner. I don’t get a text back, which is fine because I saw that she read it. She also told me the night before that she’s free after her last class ends at noon. 

[PROBLEM #1]
I get to the restaurant at 6:25 pm and get us a table inside. Ten minutes pass and at 6:35 pm, I get a text asking if I’m there yet, I reply saying I’m already inside. She then responds saying she got distracting with her dog and that she’ll be there in ten to fifteen minutes. 

Now, I usually don’t mind if someone is running late as long as they have a good reason and let me know in a timely manner. But she did neither of these things. If I agree to meet somebody at a certain time, I’m going to get there early no matter what to account for traffic, parking and searching for the place. Not only does she text me after our meeting time, she said she’ll arrive even later than that. This signals to me that she doesn’t respect other people’s time, especially with a reason like getting distracted by your dog.


[PROBLEM #2]
Once she arrives, we greet each other and I ask her how her day was, and what she did. She said she had classes up until noon, then met up with her friends after for lunch and spent the rest of the day playing with her dog. As she’s taking a look at the menu, she tells me that the reason she loves sushi so much is because her Ex was a sushi chef. 

Now I usually don’t mind when people bring up past relationships on a first date, but this kinda bothered me a lot because we hadn’t really built up much rapport other than talking about what we did in the day. And on top of that, she continued to talk about how he got her into other things like piano, and all the times he would cook for her while they were together. Maybe it’s just me, but I’m sure talking about your Ex this much isn’t something any rational person would do at the beginning of meeting someone for the first time. It occurred to me that the way she was describing him meant the break up was fairly recent.


[PROBLEM #3]
After we get our food, she has trouble using her chopsticks so I tease her about it in a lighthearted manner saying that maybe we should ask for a fork. She does something unexpected and actually decides to start criticizing the sushi chef for not rolling the sushi correctly. I was completely perplexed because our sushi rolls looked exactly the same, barring what was inside, but I had no trouble eating mine. And AGAIN, she brought up how if her Ex had made her sushi, it wouldn’t have turned out this bad. 

I was actually left speechless for a few seconds because the way she said it, it didn’t come off as a joke at all. She was being completely serious and was actually insulting the sushi chef, mind you for something that wasn’t even his fault. Her sushi had been falling apart because of her lack of basic ability to use chopsticks. 


[PROBLEM #4]
And lastly, as the waiter came back to fill up our waters, she had the audacity to say that he had an ugly and unappealing hairstyle. Now I wouldn’t say that his hair was particularly well kempt in my opinion, but I would never say that out loud in a restaurant. For me, that was three strikes and you’re out. 

I had asked the waiter for the check before either of us even got to finishing half of our meal and he brought it within a few minutes. She spent that time not making eye contact, just simply looking at her plate while I stared at her. Once the check came, I give the waiter my card quickly so he could return it. Then she decides to mention out of the blue that her Ex cheated on her. And as much as I hate people who lie and cheat, that doesn’t give her the right to act the way she did in that restaurant, nor does it excuse her behavior. 

I told her after, that maybe she shouldn’t be out dating, wasting other people’s time and insulting strangers who’ve done nothing to her simply because she got cheated on. I picked up my card, signed the check and walked out after that. Unmatched her, blocked and deleted her number because the price of that meal and walking out was better than sticking around for round 2 to uncover what other problems she would want to put on others. 

I think I gave her plenty of chances, and was more than tolerant throughout the night. But perhaps I could’ve handled it differently, thoughts? 


TLDR: I went on a dinner date with a girl that ended in me walking out before we finished our meal. She talked about her Ex majority of the time, talked bad about the wait staff and chef, and tried to make excuses for her behavior. Could I have handled it better/differently?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/fr92x0/walked_out_on_my_dinner_date_could_i_have_handled/,118,Talking to much about a recent ex means they aren’t over them which is reason enough to cut and run without even adding all the other nonsense.

I kissed her for the first time and it was the happiest day of my life. I love her so much, I’m still in denial of her being gone forever. I can still remember her smell, her smiling face, her laugh, and her cry when she had to leave. I remember that she loved to eat chicken wings and she can speak 3 different languages.

957,85m9za,False,None,71,Is it not normal/detrimental that I never 'chase' women?,dating,"Hello,

I have some experience online and IRL dating. I strongly prefer IRL. During both, I totally prescribe to the principle that I will never ""chase"" a girl. I will never spend 1 second convincing anybody that spending time with me is a good idea. 

Because I am a male dating in the US, I understand that it is mostly our 'job' to make the first move. However, after I have made my intentions clear, I do not ever follow up if I do not get a response.

This has undoubtedly lowered my dating pool, but every relationship ive been in has been extremely meaningful because I know that she was 100% about it as much as I was. 

For instance:
If a girl dosnt reply back to my text, I'll probably never text her ever again until she gets back to me (unless the text I sent her didnt leave any room for a response or something).

Here is an example: I met a girl in real life. We hit it off. We met at a show and had a great time. We met another time at a show and had a great time. 

After some back and forth texting I asked if she was available to maybe have some lunch that week. No reply. 

A week later she messaged me asking me where I went. I told her that because I didnt get a reply from her, I wasnt really interested in continuing. She told me exactly this ""I'm so sorry! I was busy with XYZ, I don't want you to think I dont like you""
I said ""awesome because I like you to and I'm glad you reached out. What are you doing this weekend, I'd love to take you out on a date friday night if you are available""

Again, no response. 

Maybe she didnt like me as much as I thought. Maybe she didnt like the word 'date', maybe something terrible happened, maybe she dropped her phone. 

The entire point of this thread, reddit, is this:

I subscribe to the ""Fuck Yes' or ""Fuck No"" mentality when dating. Every single step of the way, if she is not right there with me, then I lose interest.


Should I be double-texting girls? Should I be following up to see if they get my message? Should I ever express interest more than once? Am I doing this 'wrong'?

958,hmnart,False,Venting,115,My[26F] life is going great but I’m lonely and I don’t feel like I’ll ever find that person,dating,"Hey guys. I’m just generally frustrated and I’m coming here to vent.

I haven’t dated someone since July of last year. It’s been a whole year. And it’s not because guys haven’t approached me, it’s because I haven’t found anyone even remotely interesting. And when I do, they don’t seem interested back.

I’m 26, I started a business last year and it’s just now starting to pick up. I’m doing better financially, living in my own apartment, confident in my looks (obviously to an extent because we all have our days), have great friends and family. I’m generally very happy. The only thing that upsets me is feeling really lonely most of the time.

Loneliness is taboo to talk about but we all experience it. I’ve tried online dating and it’s a disaster. The guys on there are mostly looking for random hook ups and I’m not. I’m dating for the long term.

The guys who do want to go out with me seem to be endlessly boring. A lot of them lack ambition, the ability to plan a decent date or basic conversational skills. When I do find a guy who has what I’d like in a partner (ambition, intelligence, kindness, etc), they don’t seem interested in ever meeting me in person.

I refuse to settle, but after a year without so much as dating someone for longer than 3 dates, I start to feel like I’ll never find my person. I won’t date anyone unless they add to my already full life and at the moment no one is making the cut.

I still miss her, but hindsight has enabled me to see that our marriage was super codependent and sometimes flat out toxic, because we both weren’t “whole” without the other. We got married when she was 16 and neither of us knew anything about who we were as individuals, we were just IN LOVE^TM and figured that was all that we needed to succeed. Untreated mental health issues, infidelity that we tried to forget about instead of getting counseling for, self harm, threatening suicide, control issues, childhood physical/emotional/sexual abuse.... we both should have, not just “worked on” our issues, but sought treatment and HELP for our issues, before we ever entered the world of dating. Please, learn from my mistakes, don’t get married or have a relationship with someone because you feel like they can “complete” you.

Nobody cares how much YOU like someone - let's just put that out there. If that person doesnt reciprocate, then let it go...please!


...If someone blocks you on IG, dont reach out through fb or Twitter ""just to explain"" yourself. Do not chase them, dont try harder, dont convince yourself that if you keep asking, they may say yes the 25th time. 


...Dont go home and become obsessed with them and read into every single move they make, mistaking it as 'interest' - then negatively citiquing that persons choices in dating (just because he/she didnt select you). 


...Dont not send gifts or get friends involved in trying to convince this person to change their mind. 


...If you approach someone and they turn their back to you, play with their phone, or blatantly ignore you - walk away. Do not linger there and continue trying to have a discussion. 


...And lastly, do not take on the negative attitude that you are owed a chance by that person all because YOU have convinced yourself your feelings are deep and you have unnecessarily invested so much time in someone that doesnt care for you...

We met up today and realized we live in the same town. Then we realized she takes her pets to the animal hospital I work at part-time (used to be full-time until I switched to human medicine). Then we realized we live just a few houses away from eachother and were laughing about it for the rest of the date. We've both lived just a few houses away from eachother for our entire lives and never got to meet until today! She went to private school and I went to public school, so that's why haha. Luckily she was pretty awesome and we're both REALLY excited for our next date, otherwise it would've been ultra awkward. We were laughing about how bad it would've been if we both drove home from the coffee shop where we met up and thought we were following eachother home.

968,gq4w4v,False,Venting,34,I’m finally realizing my worth...,dating,"I’ve always struggled with extremely low self esteem. In high school, my best friend was your stereotypical “it” girl: blonde hair, blue eyes, thin, confident, just “conventionally attractive”. Because of this, to me, it seemed like every single guy in our grade had a crush on her. It felt like every week she was telling me about a new guy confessing her attraction to her, and she had multiple boyfriends all 4 years.

I, on the other hand, was shy, awkward, and just overall your average “normal” high school kid. I never put myself out there out of insecurity and shyness. I always had crushes on guys, but none ever reciprocated. Because I never had any guy admit a crush on me, and instead of attributing this to me not putting myself out there, I told myself it was because I wasn’t good enough to be liked by anyone. I did end up getting into a long term relationship the summer after senior year of high school, however this relationship ended about a year ago in my junior year of college. After that relationship ended, I joined the online dating scene, and any time I started a new conversation with a guy, it felt like I needed to act perfectly: always answering, keeping the conversation alive even if it was dying and the other person seemed to lose interest, etc. Honestly, I disrespected myself multiple times forcing connections and conversations to “prove” to myself that I could make myself enough by continuing to interact with guys who obviously weren’t romantically interested and only kept me around for sex or sex related things, and I accepted that this was the best that I could get. 

Recently, this has finally started to feel wrong to me. I am currently talking to a guy who was enthusiastic about talking to me in the beginning (about three months ago) but in the past 3 weeks, has obviously lost interest and has tapered off contact to the point that he’s been leaving my Snapchat messages on delivered for up to 9 hours or more when he’s regularly active on the app. 

For some reason, this interaction has had helped me realize that I deserve more. Normally, I would feel happy that I was getting responses at all, feeling “lucky” that a guy would even respond to me after 9 hours. Not anymore. I’ve finally started to realize that there is someone out there who will be excited to talk to me for longer than just two months, who will put in the effort to see and respond to me, and will make me feel like I am enough. That person is out there, and it doesn’t matter if I go through a period of months or even years without talking to anyone romantically. I am finally realizing my worth, and that I would rather be alone than with someone who doesn’t respect me. I honestly think I need to be alone for a while, to further these “growth” thoughts to get to a point where I can be comfortable and secure with myself enough to be able to love someone while also loving myself. I am only 21, which I know is young, and I have my whole life ahead of me and am excited to see what comes next. 

I just wanted to share these sentiments with the hope that anyone going through anything remotely similar can read this and see that there is hope...a year ago, I never would have thought I could accept anything better for myself...but I’m growing, and learning, and if I can do it, you can too!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gq4w4v/im_finally_realizing_my_worth/,118,"This is great!

I'm also going to a university for a mechanical engineering degree. I am part of a running club, and automotive engineering club, and a comedy/improv club.

I work out, and am a half-marathoner. I am white, 6'2"", 200lbs, and have long, curly hair with a light beard. I have been told that I have ""no bad features"". I play guitar and bass in my free time, draw, record my own music, and love Star Wars and a lot of post-apocalyptic horror.

The number of different women I've dated + cuddled with + fooled around with is 31. Of those, 11 of them were willing to go on a second date. Of those, I took 6 of them up on their offer. With 2 of them, we couldn't agree on a relationship or FWBs. One led me on for three dates and broke my heart. With another two, either of us broke it off after the second date. However, I only met one of these 31 women at my school.

I am extremely shy, to the point where I broke down crying in the bathroom during a company party two months ago because I realized that I didn't have any friends there. I didn't make any friends throughout my entire high school life, but it's gotten better since then. However, all of my friends of both genders like me, and say that I'm fun and interesting to talk to.

* I ***LOATHE*** dating apps. They're boring, tedious, time-consuming, and brutally competitive. I also find that I meet much better people in real life than on apps.
* Although I prefer bigger/chubbier women, I'm not particularly picky about looks. I've liked and have dated short, tall, skinny, athletic, chubby, SSBBW, and everything in between.
* My views are close to the center and I actively avoid politics - so I don't hold any toxic/extreme views.
* I have a somewhat low libido, so it's not like I only care about sex. I would much prefer a genuine, wholesome relationship.

Two nights ago, I went to the hot tub with some of my buddies and drank a few beers.

982,bpipe4,False,I Need Advice,71,Feeling extremely depressed and confused after a breakup.. My [21F] girlfriend broke up with me [20M] I'm confused and still don't know what to do,dating,"Hello everyone, well I don't even know where to start. I keep thinking about everything and what could possibly went wrong in our relationship but I just can't figure things out and it's honestly just killing me. It's driving me crazy.. I can't think about nothing else but this whole situation. 
I haven't been sleeping properly, I quitted my job cus I wasn't feeling any motivation at all. I haven't eaten properly in like 2-5 days, I been drinking this past 2 weeks like crazy and smoking till late in the night. Haven't eaten any food whatsoever. 

Well everything started a few weeks ago..  so she's in med school and she was having a rough and stressing week bc of tests and some important exams she had. And that's when she stared losing it. 

When we started dating I knew what I was signing up for. About her probably not replying to my texts or seeing each other for a few days bc of how busy she was from school. I was okay with that I was being supportive anf stuff bc this is her main goal in life.. I wasn't gonna interfere in that. All I wanted was the best for her. So I didn't asked for that much attention at least for me but I was all nuts for her. I was there everyday no matter what. So this is one of the reasons I'm so confused on what went wrong????

So during that specific week I messaged her ""good morning babe, have a nice day.. gl in your exams today. Yadaa yadaaa"" she didn't reply. 
I wasn't really bothered bc I knew she was busy and stressed. later that day I got on twitter and saw that she RT something so I liked it bc it was funny lmao. And a few minutes went by.. when she decided to text me back saying.. ""Oh I saw the notification and I felt so obligated to text you back"" 10min went by and she messages me again saying ""I can't do this anymore, this is way too much for me. When I was doing my exams today I couldn't focus bc I was thinking about you and that I needed to text you back yadaa yadaa"" 
That's when I started kinda freaking out cus she kept messaging me stuff like that. ""I don't even have time for myself and obviously I don't have time for you""
She was quick with that and said ""we'll talk about this later"" I was so confused that I didn't knew what to do atm.

4 days went by and that's when she decided to text me back and she already made up her decision about us breaking up. So she texted me this long paragraph, it was like in parts lol so I'm gonna do it like 1,2,3,4.

1. Hey, I had my last exam today so I'm done with that. I went out with my family and I had so much fun but I couldn't stop thinking about you and that I needed to give you an answer. I know I told you, you were the loml and I wanted to be with you. But I changed my mind and I no longer want that. 
2. I don't have enough time for me and I'm trying to have a ""normal life"" but I just can't bc of school so basically I don't even have time for you either. And I feel so bad bc I take forever to reply, we haven't seen in days and it must hurt you that the person you love the most takes forever to give you a lil of her time. Like I reply whenever I want or if I have time. And I feel so bad bc of that. 
3. Don't even try holding me back bc I know I'll start questioning myself about my decision and I'll ended up not breaking up with you but we'll be in the same situation. 
[Here's when I started getting a lil confused bc I felt like she wasn't a 100% sure about her decision]
4. I wanna have fun, go out, enjoy myself, develop and mature as a woman. 
[???????? What does this even mean????????] 

5. I don't think about you/us anymore and I don't wanna be with you anymore.
[This was the text that hurted the most like wow it felt like I was getting killed from inside thats when I started crying and I honestly lost it] 

**I just think it's crazy how people change so fast. Like everything came out of nowhere.**

That is pretty much my story.. and like I said I'm still so confused on what went wrong like we were good and all of a sudden she decides to breakup with me. I don't get it. 
I still cry myself to sleep everyday, thinking about her and if I should try to fix things up, idk? Should I try to get her back? 
I want y'all honest opinion, feel free to say whatever you want I can't be more miserable and affected than I am rn..

And this was my first relationship in yearsssssss so I feel that's why I'm feeling like shit rn, bc I thought I founded everything. all I really wanted from a woman in her. Like personality, etc. 
I gave her way too much expectations. I was honestly so happy and plain with her. I don't see myself without her anymore. I was really in love. 
And I still am.. WHAT SHOULD I DO YOU GUYS?

Besides that in case I have to forget about her I don't know how. I still think about her every day. I cry myself to sleep. I haven't eaten anything in like 4 days.. I've been in my room just sleeping.
Help me, please.

TL:DR I was on a long-term relationship and all of a sudden my gf decided to breakup with me. I'm extremely depressed, confused and I still don't know what to do. Should I try to fix things up? We haven't talked in 2 weeks.

984,c665n0,False,Venting,170,The Flaws of Modern Dating,dating,"So here's my ***OPINION*** on the flaws of dating in our modern society.

***First off, let me start by prefacing that  I'm a single, hetrosexual  Korean American male, consider myself relatively attractive and relatively fit (whatever) but wanted to put this out there to begin with that so that you are aware of the perspective to which this originates from.***

&#x200B;

One of the biggest flaws in my opinion regarding dating in the modern age is that males overall are basically lost when it comes to understanding where they fall in today's societal role.  I'm often lost as to what if any role I play anymore in today's society?  Where do I fit in?  Does it fucking matter any more?  Whereas in the past, this was more defined (breadwinner, head of household, protector, etc) .

Now before you go crazy saying, ""So the fuck what?  Do we have to have roles? blah blah""  This is not my point.  In fact, this is a whole other topic but rather what I'm saying is that when roles are less clear as they are today and completely blurred as they are today, it's hard to gauge in the dating world the roles we play as males in the dating world as well.

This ultimately has an effect because if the roles in the past were more defined, then the roles today should also adjust to the modern dating world as well.  In other words, if the notion of a male working and providing in families are no longer the norm, then males *making the* ***first move*** or ***paying for the first date*** and all of these antiquated roles, shouldn't they ***also*** be adjusted to the changing times?  Also, the notion of women being considered ""sexually promiscuous"" or called a ""slut"" due to simply desiring sex as much as men do, shouldn't that also be adjusted in today's society?  Aren't we way past the notion that having consensual sex is no longer a big deal at any stage of the dating timeline?  Why do we hold on to certain norms, yet not let go of others?  This is one of the major issues I have with modern dating.

&#x200B;

Second, I believe that due to the age of dating apps and social media, we have been more molded to believe there are ""types"" or standards that must be preexist in order to even have a chance in any sort of engagement whatsoever.  I can not tell you how often I'm amused by Tinder profiles that state, *""If you're under 6ft tall, swipe left""*.  I'm left laughing out loud and amused thinking that this woman's height requirement will somehow magically spawn a connection with her Tinder date than a shorter guy because height requirements have everything to do with a real connection, right?  So with that said, I'm wondering if I were to put down, *""If you have anything less than  B Cup breasts, swipe left""*  is any more damaging or less offensive?

Of course there is nothing wrong with having standards,  but  the reality is that absolutely ***NO ONE*** falls into a ***perfect list*** or set of ***preexisting standards*** that will ever match ***BEFORE*** you even meet someone.  Thus, this endless swiping of lefts and endless non matching continues to pervade our society.

Have you noticed that on dating apps that allow you to pick categories or filter your matches in their search engine come up with less matches when you keep adding more filters?  So by that logic, if a dating app has trouble creating  matches due to preexisting qualifications, what does this say about the modern dating world?  And here we are left to wonder, why is it so fucking hard?

&#x200B;

The truth is, it really isn't hard.  I think if we let go of what we ""want"" because the truth is, what we want is irrelevant when it comes to a human being, because ***EVERYONE*** comes as a unique package full of  very specific and varied experiences and feelings and simply having an open mind of experiencing a person  and connecting with a person rather than checking off standards and ""red flags""  would make the dating world so much easier.

Alas, we don't live there.  We are now in a world of disconnected and entitled people who are more image obsessed, instant obsessed, and status or financially  obsessed.  We live in a world full of unrealistic standards, and ""don't waste my time"", bots, fake profiles, cash money apps before replying, instagram click bait cam girls, ghosting as a normal way to communicate etc.  Thus, in my opinion, the existence of Tinder and how within *nanoseconds* we put our entire self worth in a swipe, is just damaging to our mental well being beyond repair.

&#x200B;

Maybe I will never find my true happiness in a relationship, but that's ***TOTALLY*** ok with me.  Because I want to experience an organic relationship filled with all the ups and downs, including the tears and frustrations. But I want to live without the ***NEED*** of being with someone but rather the desire to experience life together with someone I want to be with and truly wants to be with me.  Because no one person is the answer to happiness.  I am the answer to my own happiness.

This reminds me of how often I used to go to parties and wonder why I wasn't having a good time?  Why when I arrived home after the party that  I was happiest?  After countless parties, I realized that the reason for this was that I was fully expecting the party to make me happy.  I would simply show up expecting all of these mental images to take place and end up disappointed and frustrated if this didn't play out by the end of the night.  ***How utterly ridiculous I had been.***  The party itself is ***only*** providing a venue and the ***opportunity*** for me to have a good time.  The real party exists within me.  ***I am responsible to create my own party and fun.***  Search high and wide and you will never find *""the ultimate fun venue""* that *""epic party""* you saw in that movie.  There will never ever be a *""fun""* venue.  ***I make it fun for myself.***  I can't tell you how many times the most fun I've ever had was telling jokes and laughing outside on a quiet porch at a house  party with a group of people I took the chance with to introduce myself to.  Or the countless times I went on amazing dates and had relationships with girls whom I found interesting and struck up a random conversation with no preexisting intentions or expectations at all.  10 out of 10 times this always happened when I honestly and genuinely only wanted to have a great time and great conversation, nothing more and nothing less.

In the same light, thinking that going on countless dates or even being in a relationship will result in my happiness is just as unhealthy and destructive because nobody wants to be with someone that expects this from them.  This is by definition unfair and unrealistic.  How can someone carry the weight of your happiness on their shoulders?  Absolutely no one should have to carry this responsibility.  Relationships, I believe flourish because both people can stand on their own.  ***Expecting the other person will fulfill anything in your life is just as bad as arriving to a party and expecting the party itself to make your evening fun***. That being said, I believe that ""the one"" does ***NOT*** exist but rather, a random connection that happens when two people randomly decide to make the effort and take the random  chance of wanting to give it a go and see what happens.  Failure is a huge part of this formula as everything is based on a random chance of things working and that's totally fine and ok.  And more likely than not, you will fail of course more often than succeed.  In the end, we have always been the gatekeepers of our own happiness in every situation of life.    And that I believe will never change.    Ok, I'm done.  Vent completed.

988,9g1k5r,False,None,147,Me: “So I guess I’m your gf now? :)” Him: “We don’t need to worry about labels”,dating,"So I’ve been seeing a man several times a week for the last 5 months. He’s awesome, I’m awesome. We stay up many nights chatting for hours. We have met each other’s friends. Our goals seem to align. He always tells me I’m the hottest woman he’s ever dated.

Upfront, he told me he was looking for a serious, monogamous, committed relationship. But we had never defined the relationship before.

Well, we were talking about holiday plans this year and meeting each other’s family. He was open to meeting mine but a little hesitant about me meeting his because his family lives farther away and isn’t that close with the ones still living. But I thought to myself “wow we made it this far, I’m just going to confirm I’m his girlfriend :)”

So I say “haha I guess I’m your girlfriend now!” after talking about these travel plans. Totally expecting him to say “of course :)” or something like that.

Instead, he replies with “We don’t really need labels. I mean I would never want to put this on Facebook or anything. I like to keep my dating life completely separate from any of my social media or anything public like that.

989,8a8au3,False,None,35,Dating Advice; take it or leave it,dating,"I scroll through this sub often and see alot of similar questions asked. While I'm no expert I'm fairly attuned with myself and can see the trends in what many face issues with in the dating game.

The first piece of advice is to be honest with yourself and others, right from the start. As plain and simple as this sounds, it's a big one. Nowadays dating is mostly done online and stats say in the next 20 years almost 70% relationships will be formed online. It's really easy to make a fancy tinder/online profile with a witty bio and put your best images forward, but try and be real here. The more real you are with someone right from the start; the more real they will be with you and you don't have to pretend to impress them and follow up on being someone you are not. This will hopefully weed out the superficial people for you and save a whole lot of drama. 

The next piece of advice is learn to read others and don't be oblivious to the fact they are not interested. Ghosting is the most obvious sign somebody doesn't want a whole lot more to do with you. Nobody likes conflict hence the majority choose to ghost. Yea it sucks but if you ignore it and are clinging on to that little bit of hope that they will get back to you, you're wasting your time and missing out on potential opportunities with people who will actually respond and give you the time of day.

The next piece of advice is to make sure you never make someone your sole reliant for happiness. The root of suffering is attachment. Love can be a crazy thing and happen very fast but be mindful to this and try to make sure you reserve some of yourself for if things are to all of a sudden take an unexpected turn. We humans are very intricate things and nobody will ever perceive reality quite the same as you, as much as you might want them to.

Lastly, be confident in yourself. Don't ever be scared of rejection. It is way easier said than done but life is very short. If someone is making eyes with you a few times and your gut instinct is telling you there might be something of chemistry there, go talk to them and find out. The worst that can happen is they laugh and tell you no. Don't be scared of words. It's literally just words. Even asking someone and being rejected will give you so much more confidence for the next time.

I hope this can be of help to some of you out there. Good luck and much love beautiful humans
