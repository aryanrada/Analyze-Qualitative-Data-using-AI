Ever since, I’ve been experiencing the worst depression I’ve had in forever. The rollercoaster I’ve been riding for the last week brought me to the point of wanting to just end it all a few nights ago. 

I was feeling really guilty this morning for what I have been putting my loved ones through. I almost fell back to where I was a couple of nights ago. But instead, I got out of bed, and just took a shower. Now I’m laying in my moms bed. I haven’t said anything to her. But I’m feeling a lot better now. And I was able to avoid the longing to end my life.  

Thank you all for your posts in this sub. I stumbled on it this morning and it motivated me enough to get me out of bed. I didn’t even have the strength to move before.

&#x200B;

Like (presumably) a lot of people, I felt as if I was incredibly smart growing up. I was able to start school early when I was younger, I had a near perfect GPA, I painted, I played multiple instruments, and my parents were pushing me to apply for top schools. My future looked really bright.

However, in the middle of senior year (of high school), something felt really wrong, and everything began to fall apart (lol, that sounds overly dramatic...but just know that I really was not in the right state of mind). I couldn't get up to eat, I cried at random times at school, **(warning for triggering visualization? not sure if this would count as one) \*\*** I began to harm myself a lot (like I mostly beat my legs or arms with objects), and I was just deep into depression. I tried to commit suicide multiple times, **\*\***

&#x200B;

Like I've experienced periods of sadness before this, but never as intense and for an entire year.

Luckily, I did well enough in school before all of this happened, so I was awarded a scholarship to let me go to community college for free— so I didn't completely self-sabotage my future. So I've been working on transferring for the past year.

&#x200B;

However, I'm so distraught. I feel like my intelligence has gone down the drain. I slur when I talk, I developed a bit of a lisp, I can't coordinate my actions to my thoughts, I even forget letters when writing (for example, I would write ""oadside"" instead of ""roadside"" or ""mozzera"" instead of ""mozzerella""). I feel so, so disappointed in myself and it's ruining my self esteem. I even had to say the phrase ""I want to know what I originally got on my essay"" three times the other day to my professor because I couldn't remember how to say it, and he looked at me really funny.

&#x200B;

Is this normal?? Like I said, it's ruining my self esteem completely, and I feel like I'll never be the person I once was. I'm starting to relapse back into my depression because I feel so worthless, and I feel like I don't know what to do. I've tried reading more, downloading cognitive supporting apps (like Luminosity?), and I've been sleeping okay and drinking lots of water. But I don't know. Has anyone experienced something like this and was able to rework themselves back to the person they originally were? If so, how did you do it?

Or am I doomed to plummet even further than I am now...

Sorry if this question seemed pretentious or if I seemed pretentious in any way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/budx90/has_anyone_else_feel_like_they_have_become_less/,305,"Depression definitely screws with brain chemistry. And yes it does impair intelligence.

The best thing is to get over the depression. Think MINERALS and learn all you can and then get more minerals (especially magnesium) in your diet and leave off SUGAR, DAIRY, AND JUNK/PROCESSES OF ALL KINDS

Force yourself to exercise more. Take apple cider vinegar with water, lemon juice and sweetener every morning.

You will feel better soon. ",2019-05-29 12:15:24

If that’s the case brushing for the first time will lead to bleeding and discomfort.

If you’re really struggling just buy some mouth wash, the cheapest I’ve seen is 70p for a normal bottle. Using this just once a day can be a start.

When you can start brushing your teeth Use sensitive toothpaste such as sensodyne toothpaste. It will hurt a lot less and claims to repair damage. 

If it hurts, stop! When I’ve been at my worse I had to build up from mouth wash to 30 seconds then adding 10 seconds each time until I built up to 2 mins and then flossing.

If you start to floss, use sensitive floss and don’t do it straight away after a long time, it can make the bleeding worse. Work up to flossing.

I tried to find this advice a few years ago but no one is really open about it so I thought I’d share. Good luck!

Kids at his school bullied him almost daily because of it, often going as far as assaulting him and yelling racial slurs at him. 

His family said he often prayed for his bullies and never fought back when they attacked him.  

Well, he hung himself, a 10 year old boy knew how to hang himself. This poor little innocent child will never see what a beautiful life he had ahead of him because his bullies thought it was so hilarious to attack something he could not control.

We are all in this sub reddit because we have faced, are facing depression, pain, mental disorders. Some of us may have faced bullies in our lives. And those “bullies” are all facing problems of their own causing them to lash out at others. And unfortunately, they are causing so much pain for those who do not deserve it.

So today, I am asking all of you to please keep this little boy in your thoughts because he was one of us, and unfortunately the pain was too much for his innocent soul. If any of you are facing problems that you feel are too big for you to handle. Please seek help. Reach out to those around you because I would not be here today if I didn’t make the decision to seek help.

91,droxsm,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,14,"If you don’t have the energy to do something, try taking a micro-step",depression_help,"Many people with depression obviously lack energy, ambition and motivation. Thinking about accomplishing large tasks can trigger anxiety, which causes depression, which causes anxiety, and so on. It’s counter productive to think about the large task you have to do.

A solution I found helpful for this problem is to take micro steps. Just do the tiniest step you can towards that goal you have, and don’t be embarrassed by how small it is.

For instance, if you want to lose weight, exercising is an obvious goal, but it can sound so painful and atrocious that you simply refuse to do it. On the other hand, you could effortlessly do a single push-up (or whatever exercise is effortless for you) at this moment. *boop.* It is done. You did it. It took 3 seconds. It didn’t hurt. 

You may be thinking, “oh wonderful, now I’ve done a push up, I’m still nowhere near my goal of losing 50 pounds!” Yet, what I’ve found with micro-steps is they build momentum: 

- Even if I only do one push-up, I’m better off than where I just was. 

- Then, upon realizing one push-up was so easy yesterday, I can do another push-up tomorrow. It is still extremely easy. 

- Then I do one push-up every day for a week. It’s still extremely easy. 

- Then I do TWO pushups every day for a week. Still extremely easy. And hey 14 pushups a week ain’t too shabby. 

- Then I decide I’m going to add one more push-up every day of the week (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). It’s still easy. It’s just *one more* than I *yesterday*, which was easy. 

- then I do this for two weeks (14 push-ups at the end). I reach day 14 and while it’s no longer as easy as one push-up, it’s something I’m proud of now and I don’t want to break my streak. I’m doing hundreds of pushups a month now.. I hadn’t done a single push-up in years before this started. It’s still nowhere near as hard as I originally imagined. It hurts for a minute, then I get a body high. It’s enjoyable overall. Wow, I see why people like this! Unbelievable. People are complimenting me for looking healthier. Unbelievable. I feel healthier. Cant stop this now, it’s working!

- then, a few months later I do this for 3 weeks

- then 4 weeks..

- and so on... 

I repeated this pattern and I’m currently up to doing 150 pushups 3x per week. I put on a podcast and take my time and don’t even think twice about it. It’s mildly annoying and then it feels great when I’m down. 

I have the strength to do 150 pushups a day now because I wasn’t ashamed to do that one pushup 5 years ago. If I hadn’t done that one push-up, I probably would have never done *anything*. Taking the tiny micro step of manifesting your goals can build momentum that you desperately need when you’re in a depression funk. Without any momentum you feel like there is no purpose. You are like a flower blocked from the sun. But even a small amount of sunlight can change everything, causing you to grow into places where you can effortlessly reach more sunlight. 

This also works for tasks you have to get done in the short term. Have a paper due tomorrow? First thing in the morning, just open up Microsoft word. You’ll think “well that was easy, I took the first step.” Then you will consider how hard the second step is: a title. Not hard. Now you’ve done something. And it’s only 7am. I’ll take an hour break and then write some outlines... then I’ll write a sentence. ..Then a paragraph... this is actually not so bad... 

once you take that first step of that opening Microsoft word, things stop seeming so daunting. Everything gets put into better perspective when you manifest your thoughts into actions, even in the most microscopically small way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/droxsm/if_you_dont_have_the_energy_to_do_something_try/,200,"This is good advice, but OP is trashy.

98,gguht8,False,RANT,20,I’m kind of embarrassed by how much taking care of a cat has improved my mental health.,depression_help,"So I’ve dealt with chronic depression my whole life, I have a lot of strategies to help and I’m almost in my thirties, I’m proud that I’ve become pretty functional. But I still have dark days or weeks or sometimes months, and I know I will again in my life. But I can go to work, get along well with my co-workers and clients, and don’t let things spiral until my life implodes like I used to. Always reminds me of a line from a song by the naked and famous:

“There are certain things
That I have to do.
Day to day just to keep it at bay,
You wouldn’t believe if you knew”

And I’ve been doing okay with that. But I let things in my personal life, the parts I can keep private or aren’t a “big deal” slip consistently. My room is always a mess, I let my beard get big and bushy even though I (and everyone I know) thinks it looks much better trimmed, leave bills unpaid too long, the usual put off until tomorrow what I could do today sort of stuff. And not even to do fun stuff, I just kind of dither and worry about the things I’m not doing. 

A few weeks ago a cat just kind of showed up in my life. One of my roommates left the place and didn’t take his cat with him, the lease holder wanted to give him to the humane society but dragged his feet about it. The cat decided I was his person now, started following me around like a puppy and meowing pathetically if I didn’t let him hang out in my room. I was reluctant to adopt him because I was raised to believe pets are a ride or die engagement, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for the commitment. Finally the lease holder said he was going to take him to the humane society that afternoon, I said bye to him with some sadness, and went to work. but he had only been “my cat” for a week so I figure better he go sooner before he got too attached. He’s an adorable sweet boy and only a year old so I didn’t think he would languish too long and he was being taken to a no-kill shelter.

While I was at work it really stuck in my craw. I just kept imagining the poor little guy sitting in a cage and not knowing why he had been brought there or what would happen next. But when I got home he was still there! I decided screw it, he’s my cat now. Told my roommates I’d take responsibility for him and dubbed him Jonesy, cause he looks like the cat from alien.

I’ve been taking care of him for about 3 weeks and my life has improved In pretty much every way. There is the mental health improvement from having an animal around, he’s a very affectionate cat. he waits for me by the door when he hears my car park like a dog, and he pretty much always wants to cuddle. But there is also the improvement from having something to take care of. I’ve been keeping my room clean because he will try to play with anything that crinkles or clanks, so empty cans or bags of chips or whatever are a no go. I always actively
play with him when I get home from work, and just focusing on being present for that period of time and doing nothing but interacting with the cat (I don’t answer text, listen to music, watch TV, I just play with Jonesy) is very calming and centering. Cleaning my room has expanded into just taking better care of myself in general. I’m drinking less, flossing twice a day, keeping the beard neat. I usually feel like all the little things I don’t do are constantly piling up, but right now for the first time in my life I feel like I’m catching up.

I’m straight up embarrassed by how much I love this animal. He’s my little fuzzy rock in a sea of chaos. I can’t control much in the world but I can give this little bastard the best goddamn cat life a cat can have. I know there will still be some dark times ahead but I feel like I have a new ally in the daily struggle. Just wanted to rant about my cat and feeling good for the first time in awhile, thanks for reading!

99,cd5y3j,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,35,"Wearing My ""Social Mask"" Exhausts Me",depression_help,"I feel like I'm losing my ability to cope with being around people. Even those I like and am friends with? Being around people has always felt like it's depleting a little HP bar somewhere inside me because I have some inner pressure constantly to be likable and interesting. It's shattering.

But it's getting worse. I'm finding it harder and harder to resist the temptation of isolation and then FOMO starts kicking my ass too. Can't win. Just feel miserable...",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/cd5y3j/wearing_my_social_mask_exhausts_me/,197,"Addressing to the concern you are experiencing I would like to tell you that this kind of might be result of some unaddressed emotions. try to identify what is it that is making you resort to isolation. 

Some times it is the Feeling of detachment one experiences that makes one chose isolation. There could be various reasons a person feels detached from others like [fear of judgment](https://www.betterlyf.com/articles/stress-and-anxiety/4-tips-to-care-less-on-how-others-judge-you/), shame, traumatic experiences, [conflicts with loved ones](https://www.betterlyf.com/articles/relationships/how-do-you-resolve-conflicts/), growing apart in relationships. Unable to establish or strengthen bond (emotionally/psychologically) with family and friends also makes one feel less dependable on others. 

Coming to the second concern, First let us understand what FOMO is-

“FOMO is a leading contributor to ‘inauthentic life’ in the 21st century,” says psychologist Dr. Ramani Durvasula. “Everyone is so afraid of missing out that they rarely take the solitary moments to recharge or at least be discerning about where they go and what they do.”

Why do we experience FOMO?

* A deep dissatisfaction with our own lives
* A feeling that everybody else is leading a more glamorous life than we are
* Comparison – we keep comparing our behind the scenes with everyone else’s highlight reel.
* Likelihood to value social media as part of one’s social development
* A deep seated need to cut down on losses- We do not want to lose out on what we think everybody has
* Novelty Seeking – when opportunity to do something novel or go somewhere new (when that situation might not arise again) is missed, it can cause a deep sense of FOMO to set in.

How to cope up with feeling of missing out?

* Take a reality check – Remind yourself that nobody’s life is perfect, even if it looks that way when you see all the great things they are doing. We tend to make social media a measure of our self worth but it’s also beneficial to realize you can’t judge a book by its cover. The outward image people project on social media isn’t necessarily truthful — you’re never getting the entire story.
* Inspiration Instead of Envy – When we see others having or enjoying things that we admire we can either choose to be envious or seek inspiration and try our best to do what it takes to bring those things to our lives.
* Say No – You can’t have it all. You have to say no to some things in order to say a meaningful yes to others.
* Gratitude – Relax, enjoy and appreciate what you do have instead of always looking at what others have and feeling bad about yourself.
* Striving for balance – There is no harm in looking at our friend’s photos and posts or follow a celebrity on instagram or twitter as long as that inspires us and we seek positive encouragement without losing our focus from life in general.

101,goxyim,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,10,"To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways.",depression_help,"My mom just got high blood pressure today. And it's my fucking fault.

Since I don't live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy.

Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her life's mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said ""I'm fine."" Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to tell you. I'm sorry.

Within the several days, my mom *really* tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didn't let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldn't swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like they're lying, that it's their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and *so much time.* 

I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger I'd hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We don't get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too.

My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. She'd take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and she'd spread it all over my arm where I'd hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long see-through sash, and she'd tie and secure it on my arm so I don't pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, I'd always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me.

Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brother-in-law. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room (no electronics in my room), and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an all-nighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didn't like me using because they didn't use it and found it a waste of time (the apps were things like TikTok and some games). While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldn't vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer (which was in the living room, and I didn't want to see their faces). So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs + 2-3 layers of skin. It wasn't bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. 

Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was (I had cried a few times earlier) and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 2-3 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and that's when we decided to bring her to the ER.

On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she could've gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasn't my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, that's the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens.

Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.

I feel so bad. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm just wondering if my mom really needs a child like me. Maybe she's better off with my older sister and her perfect husband and perfect child. I stand out in the picture anyways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/goxyim/to_everyone_who_actually_took_time_to_read_this/,199,"I'm sorry for everything you're going through, it sounds very stressful. From your post it seems like your mom really cares about you and that you feel bad about times that you've blown up at her. My advice would be to tell her about that, tell her that you feel bad but also that you feel like people are lying and whatever else you're feeling.

Importantly, I wonder if your mother can be your ally to advocate for you against your brother-in-law to get you some more iPad time. Tell her that you need to talk to your friends as they are part of your support system and how you feel when all these restrictions are placed on you.

On the topic of self-harm, my heart goes out to you. I also know of a close friend that does this and it breaks my heart but I've learned to not tell them to stop. The reality is that it is a coping mechanism for you, and you won't be able to stop until you've found another coping mechanism to replace it, so that you can deal with the stresses that come your way. Maybe your mom and you can look into harm reduction approaches that will minimize the harm that comes to you, like not using scissors (especially ones that could have rust on them) or how to know if you've gone too far.

You all matter and it doesn't matter what your depression or suicidal thoughts tell you.,depression_help,"I'm in a similar boat with all of you, but suicide isn't the way out, and self-harm doesn't help. Everyone I know who's self-harmed tell me not to do it. Your life matters. I know it doesn't seem like it does, I know you're being told something entirely the opposite, but theres always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how long that tunnel is. It doesn't matter how many times you fail, what matters is if you give up on yourself. Please, you do, in fact, matter. You are, in fact, worth something. Hold onto whatever makes you wanna live, no matter how small or insignificant that thing might be, its still worth living for. If your family wouldn't care, if you don't have friends, if you feel as if not a single soul cares about what happens to you, at least know that I'd care. Alot of people I knew were depressed or suicidal, and things got better for them.

Please. Do SOMETHING. Go on a walk, for example. It doesn't have to be a big one, it could be just around the block or up and down your sidewalk. Or you could read a book, or do a small workout, etc. I know it seems pointless, but these things help improve your mood. I'm speaking from experience.

Eat something.  Don't starve yourself. It only worsens the pain.

You have to force yourself out of this. I know, all you feel like you're capable of doing is lying in bed, but it won't ever get better if you don't break the cycle. I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you really wanna wake up every morning wanting to die? I don't think any of us enjoy it. Do you really wanna die, or do you just want these thoughts and feelings to cease? Vent in the comments of this post if you want. I don't mind.

108,brpt7q,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,34,My friend killed himself after 8 failed attempts over many years. Don't always trust their parents alone to do the right thing cause sometimes they just don't; they make it worse.,depression_help,"I'm 23 now, it's been a couple years since he died and I can't help but remember him on occasion whenever I experience something new or good in life. I just think ""if he didn't end it all he'd have seen the bigger picture eventually"". It's never as simple as that but at the same time, it is; it's all about the timing.

  He had it all. He was popular, had that ripped body everyone envied him for, had the attention of the ladies and had a wealthy family. None of that seems to matter one bit when it concerns clinical depression. It only got worse with whatever his dad thought was the best response which was to initially send him to live in another country thinking a change of scenery was all he needed after his first few attempts, that didn't really work either. His dad's solution was to just deal with it like a man ought to and so my friend confided in his grandfather instead of his own parents. This one time he jumped off the fourth floor of his house (wealthy family like I said) and only survived cause he landed on his car. Shattering his skull and shoulder blades, he was back up and walking in a few months. The guy was a tank, a kick boxer and at the peak of his physique so he seemed to oddly survive his various attempts. 

  Things settled when he got into a stable relationship for a few years and we grew out of touch but I heard he was doing well and had left the country with his significant other. The last thing I heard after that was how his grandfather had died and that they found he had hanged himself a few days after the funeral. His family didn't even tell his friends about it, they just had a quick and quiet funeral for him the next day and I only found out about it months later. 

  That was the end of his story but it doesn't have to be for so many others out there. Please seek professional help for you or for those you know are going through cycles of depression. The worst way to deal with it is to leave it to conservative families that care more about impressions and ""manning up"" than being humble enough to band together when one is hurting and be supportive and nurturing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/brpt7q/my_friend_killed_himself_after_8_failed_attempts/,191,"You are describing me, literally.

I can say, that ripped body and skills mean nothing when you are depressed, you still think you are worthless.
I hope my life doesn't end this way, because i care about everyone, but most people insult me through jokes because they think that because i am strong and workout a lot i can handle it. Sorry, i can not. It hurts when someone says that i am still not strong or good enough, and that i should not be depressed because i am financially well off or have the ""great body"". 
Please don't think that i want to show off somehow, i do not. I just workout a lot to try and ease my depression, but us ""ripped"" guys can also be depressed and need love and support.

im jealous of people living in developed countries, i really am.

i was born in a joke of a country in africa, its just like the usual, crap healthcare, shitty education, corrupt government, locked in neverending wars, blah blah, and im not really sure what i can do about it,

they had somesort of revolution recently but itll probably take years before any real changes happen

everybody is living like shit but theyre all so hopeful about the revolution for some reason, im not really sure why

its amazing thery all so hopeful even though everbody lives like crap, im really jealous, i wish i could feel the same way

and my family has been really helpful so far, giving me a bed to sleep in, food to eat and such even though everything is so expensive for them , i dont feel that im grateful enough, and theres alsso people living worse than me so i dont have any right to feel sad

the country is sudan if that helps

im attending a really crappy uni for medical school that i really dont care about, it doesnt have a professional looking website even

and the lecture halls are really small, it doesnt look anything like i saw in moviees and such

apparently if you can get a medical degree or an engineering one, you can work outside if you get really good grades, even in super advanced countres like australia or canada, but you have to pass some sort of really diffcult exam before you can get accepted and that worries me, because i dont think i can get motivated enough anyway to study for it

im really jealous of westerners, they have everything they could ever want

they have cool things like museums and space obsevatories and such, ive always wanted to go to one of these, or maybe a movie theater, ive never been in one before, while here we have nothing

im sorry for rambling and my really crappy grammar, i just wrote whatever was on my mind and i dont really care about revising

thanks, just writing this down after bottling it up for so long feels really liberating, i feel so much better already, and usually im not in this much of a bad mood, ill probably get over it in the morning

All that I can say is thank you, and I hope you get through all your problems as well.

Finding some sort of medium to talk about my problems, especially in a country that doesn't take mental health seriously at all, it honestly feels amazing.

It's just like some of you have said, people in developed countries can definitely suffer too. It's always a good idea to put yourself in other people shoes and see what they're going through. Even if they're much better off than I am, they can still be depressed, and that's okay.

There are also people far worse than I am, even in developed countries, and that's also okay.

Thank you for reminding me about perspective, and once again, thank you for replying.

Even if you're not you can still get mental health care for literally nothing to maybe $20 a visit with other insurance and even if they don't take your insurance they often will do a pay up front and then reimburse you later through your insurance.  Also many employers offer EAP which you can get free visits to a licensed therapist or psychiatrist.  

I make $24,000 a year and I have the cheap insurance and still only had to pay about $45 a visit which was going to be reimbursed anyway because the therapist I was using wasn't actually covered under my insurance, and I have to take Prozac and Xanax and I think I pay only about $3 for both medications for a month's worth.  

I think it's just an issue that people don't understand that there already are a lot of free or affordable services for mental health care. ",2019-12-20 03:17:44

I just wanted to put this out there because I can't bring myself to tell anyone I actually know. And I'm not looking for sympathy or attention either.. I knew what I was doing. Yesterday had been one of my low points. One of the lowest in my life. I suffer from depression and lately it's been really hard. My fiance doesn't understand how someone can be depressed. She thinks that I should just choose to not be and so talking to her is impossible. I have friends, really great friends might I add, that would listen and be there for me but they all have things going on in their lives and I wouldn't want to burden them with my problems. My family loves me too but I hardly reach out to them so I definitely don't want the one time I finally do to be about my issues. I know I know, it's the depression talking right? But anyways, I was home alone yesterday and I just couldn't climb out of the hole I'd been in. Me and my fiance were fighting really bad and I didn't know what else to do. I sat on the bed and pulled out the gun in her nightstand and looked at it for awhile. I kept putting it up to my head and back down again. I was terrified and angry at myself for feeling scared. I finally put it up to my head and sat there for a minute longer. As my finger finally went to the trigger I got a text from my friend Brooke. It literally said this, ""Hey friend, thinking about you, and I love you so much. Thanks for dealing with my nonsense :) you're an amazing human."" Now granted we hadn't been texting that day and I can't make this up. I literally got it the moment I decided to end it, like something out of a movie. I broke down crying and immediately put the gun up and just grabbed my dog and sat on the ground. Now I can't say I won't feel my depression eat at me anymore but she made me realize in that moment that I wouldn't just be ending my pain by doing that, but I'd be passing it to the people I love. And that scares me the most. I still haven't told her, I don't think I ever will, but she saved my life yesterday and she has no idea. It might've not had been a big deal to her sending that to me but it changed my world. Literally. If there's anyone reading this that is feeling suicidal, please try and remember that.

I posted this on r/SuicideWatch but I figured maybe it belonged here too :) 

If you're here that means you're probably hurting a lot right now and I want to start of by saying that I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're going through this, you don't deserve it and you're important to me. Every single one of you.

I'm also really sorry that I can't take your pain away. If I could, I would take it in a heartbeat, I don't even care that I would have to deal with it. You guys on here are my main priority. 

I've spent a lot of my time on here, messaging people to try to help and the things that you're dealing with are intense. I truly understand everything that you're feeling and it's all valid. You aren't 'weird' or 'wrong' , these feelings are very real and it's so so hard to be fighting with yourself all the time.

I want you all to know that if I could, I'd give you a big hug and let you know that you're worthy and important and that it's going to be okay, even though it feels like the complete opposite right now. 

As someone who has and still is struggling with suicidal thoughts and self harm, I understand it's hard to just 'not' have them. Self harm is as hard to quit as smoking or drinking, because it ""relieves"" pain for a short while, while building it up in the background that leads to it becoming an unhealthy addiction. 

I know how hard mental illness hits, and while seeing a doctor/therapist/psychologist is a great option, I know that it's hard to make that step. You might not be ready to talk. You might not be able to afford it. You might not be able to get to one by yourself. I understand. But talking about it is proven to help manage things. I can't solve your problems or take them away, however much I want to, but I can make sure you don't go through this alone. 

You can talk to me about anything whenever, no judgement on reddit or discord. 

My reddit is u/I_have_a_cold_soul 

My Discord is I_have_a_cold_soul #3036

A list of international suicide hotline numbers: https://ibpf.org/resource/list-international-suicide-hotlines

Message me if you're struggling or if you aren't. I want to know, how are you doing today? 

Once again, you guys are strong and brave and I'm proud of you endless amounts for fighting everyday, you're such a good job. 
You're great people going through terrible times and that's why you aren't going to do it alone. 

Stay strong :) I believe in every single one of you.

[Originally posted on r/Advice as ""Why am I such a pathetic loser and how do I fix it before it gets me killed?"" My request for advice was downvoted there and I'm worried no one will reply because of that. Also, this seems like a better place to voice these concerns anyway.]

I'm 26 years old. My problem is this. I'm a quitter with no willpower. I give up on everything before I've even had a chance to really try. I'm afraid of putting in effort, and if I'm *forced* to make an effort, I do quite well for awhile, and then freeze up at some point late into the process, panic, dig my feet into the ground, drop everything, and stubbornly persist in inaction until all my progress has been sabotaged. This attitude and approach toward everything I do has ruined my life.

Through elementary school and high school, I was eccentric and asocial, but brilliant. My performance was excellent, far above the curve, right up to the end. Then, in the middle of 12th grade, I stopped trying. I didn't mean to stop trying. It was more like I couldn't try anymore even if I tried to try. Like my try engine was busted. My performance declined immediately, and it was only because I'd done so well up to that point that I still managed to graduate with excellent grades.

My performance up to that point got me a few merit scholarships, none of them in the area. One was for a school in Pennsylvania. I'm from the bay area in northern California, and my single mother was poor and we wanted to save money by any means possible, so I moved to Pennsylvania to go to college. This was perhaps too bold of me. Because I was used to succeeding, I was spoiled and believed I could do anything effortlessly. I believed I wouldn't have any transition pains. Friends, don't be smart, it makes you stupid.

I did well for one year, but I was miserable. Then I did pretty badly for most of another year because I froze up again and refused to make an effort. I felt like the world around me wasn't real, like every person and every building was made of cardboard and nothing I could do would have any consequence, so I just stayed in my dorm room all day every day. I wound up having to withdraw to avoid having it on my record that I'd flunked out, so I moved back to California to be with my mom again.

My credits from Pennsylvania couldn't be considered, so I had to go to community college for another, well, two years, I think? Then, with my grades already ruined and age having made me less attractive a prospect, we bit the bullet and sent me to a local university without a scholarship as a transfer student, with money we didn't really have per se.

I did kind of well for a year, and then started resisting my own progress again and having mental breakdowns. My second year, I wound up having to withdraw because I refused to make an effort any longer. I then repeated my second year and finished it. The year after that, my mother passed away unexpectedly and I had to withdraw again (though, for once, it's understandable).

It's been 2 years since then, and everything since then has just blurred together and left me confused, but I think what happened was something like this: I came back to try again when I felt I was ready, I was wrong and wasn't ready so I had to withdraw again, I came back again, and (very recently) after fighting a losing battle to stay afloat, I just completely gave up and decided I'm fundamentally not good enough for this. I withdrew permanently, on the very year I was meant to finally graduate.

I'm morbidly obese. While I was at the university back at home in California, I lost 130 pounds. I thought I could keep it up and achieve an acceptable weight. Since my mom died, I've gained it all back.

Also, through all this school BS, I've never learned to drive, never gotten a job or even tried applying for one, and until three months ago, I never even lived on my own. Now I'm renting a place with the money my mother's life insurance company paid out to me as her designated beneficiary. It's quite a significant chunk of money, so I'm fortunate enough to have some time to figure out how to be the adult I'm long overdue to be. But my time isn't unlimited.

I was also very dependent on her. Right up to when I was around 21 or so, she still bought me most of what I owned, still cleaned up after me and did my laundry, still drove me around, still arranged most of my meetings and kept track of the rest for me, still talked to people on my behalf because I didn't have the guts. I've since learned to do most of these things on my own, but even as I type this, there are around 15 bags of garbage in my studio apartment not taken out. I usually take out the garbage like any sane person, but for the past several weeks, I've been ""forgetting."" I also don't brush my teeth and hardly ever get haircuts. I'm basically barely capable of caring for myself.

Also I don't have any friends. Well, it's more like I refuse to have any. I show people a good personality, and they like me, and try to be my friends, but I freeze up and shut them out. I don't want them in my life. I don't want to hurt them by inevitably not being there when they need me, and I don't want to get hurt, either. Even a disgusting slob like myself could get laid if I wanted to, people have even made advances on me maybe two or three times in my life, but I refuse connections like that, too. If anyone tries to get close to me sexually, that's an even bigger red flag to me than if they try to be my friend. I go into panic. I've literally physically fled sobbing from a situation like that once before.

Please don't judge me too harshly for this, but because of my refusal to be with others or be vulnerable, I'm so touch-starved that I actually bought a love doll. Worst decision of my life. I don't know what to do with it now. I have nowhere to put it, and having it in my studio apartment, just existing, staring at me, judging me, makes me feel really horrible. I am going to have to order a hacksaw off Amazon, take the doll apart, and discreetly throw it out with the trash.

Like I said, I have a financial buffer to figure things out, but my time isn't unlimited. I don't believe I'm capable of holding down a job. I couldn't even hold down school. My mental problems are just too frequent for me to function in society, and I don't even have any aspirations left that I actually still believe in or appreciate. But at the same time, that kind of attitude, where I'm willing to say I'm not good enough for a job without even ever having tried to work one, is exactly what I'm talking about when I say I'm a quitter and too afraid of making an effort at anything.

Once my lease ends, I'm seriously considering either disposing of most of my belongings and entering into voluntary homelessness, or moving out of state again in search of a less competitive housing market, one where I could work a job simple and solitary enough for someone like me to handle, like carrying boxes around, and still make enough money to afford rent. Or both: disposing of most of my belongings, moving out of state to somewhere where it's safer to be homeless and no one I know can judge me, and dipping under the radar and into the urban wilderness.

Speaking of safety, that's where ""before it gets me killed"" comes in. The only thing keeping me from diving headlong into homelessness is that I don't want it to get me killed. Well, the same could probably be said for most people, right? Who would spend hours of every day making someone else richer if they didn't have to do it to survive? But if I don't become a better person soon, I won't have a choice. I'll wind up homeless, voluntary or otherwise, and if I'm not prepared for that, it very well might kill me. Also, my obesity might kill me if I don't slim down.

I know what I have to do. I've known that much for my whole life. I know most of the pure pragmatic *how* as well. What I don't know is how to find the strength.

I don't remember ever not being miserable. I remember this time when I was 9 years old and kept wailing in a grocery store and pulling on my mom's arm. Did we pass by a snack or toy I wanted? No. Hardly. I'd just felt a surge of emotion come over me for no particular reason I could discern, and I was literally begging her to end my life because I was too afraid to try it myself. I was hanging off her arm and wailing out ""kill me"" in the middle of the store. I don't know why I've been so unhappy for my whole life, but I guess my senior year in high school was just when it all culminated and I couldn't put up with it any longer, and I haven't really been able to ever since.

Therapy seemed to help a lot, but needing therapy so badly you can't even get it together to actually leave your house to go get it can be quite a predicament.

Slowly, I felt better but externally my life was still a mess so I tried to find what I can change in my life that I have control over and set goals and what can I do to achieve these goals and it shouldn't be something big, even small simple things that you can achieve in a day can do. these small things that you achieve might help you feel better and see progress and have some order in your life and motivate you to continue.

153,exhaok,False,INSPIRATION,36,Read this if you're feeling down.,depression_help,"Hi!

As a sufferer of depression, I know how tricky it can be. Sometimes it comes in waves, sometimes it's just hanging above your head everywhere you go, like a black cloud. Some days you wake up feeling kinda hopeful just to barely make it home alive in the afternoon, begging for every car to hit you, begging for your train to derail so you can get the fuck out of it all. Some days I'm like that.
But now I have a moment of clarity and I wanna share it with you.

You are worthy of life. Your life is not a waste. You always have something to be grateful for. A roof above your head, a handful of people that care about you, a lovely pet, some good books, good music, great movies... Maybe your hair is awesome all the time. Believe me, you're amazing in a few ways. Turning our lives from a curse into a gift is always within our reach. Just use your calm and clean moments to create reminders of this mindset. Post-it notes, reminders on your phone, a tattoo, whatever it takes. You can do it. If you need help, reach out for it. It's not weakness. It's actually quite the opposite. You're strong as hell for admitting that you have a problem, that you wanna change it and that you need some help with that. Believe me, it'll be better.

Don't give in to false ideals, like happiness and over-romanticized love. Happiness is not a constant state. True happiness is being content with who you are. Stop looking for 'the One'. There's no such thing. There are only potentially good partners you can form something beautiful and worthwhile with, if you're both willing to work on it and be emotionally aware. Stop trying so hard to be perfect. You won't be. None of us is. But we're all unique and we can always strive to be better. Do it for you. Let the fuel be self-love. The world is full of wonder. 

You've pushed through another day and for some people that's extremely hard. The people around you might not understand what you're going through. But I do and I'm proud of you!

Stay strong! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/exhaok/read_this_if_youre_feeling_down/,152,I've kept this post on an open tab in my browser the the past few days because it has been a rough week. Thank you. ,2020-02-02 02:27:44

I also posted this to suicidewatch but for some reason it was taken down by the mods, but that isn’t gonna stop me from sharing it. 

I began self harming at 13 and I would cut myself every damn day for years. When I was 14 I got so fed up with the world and who I was that I started taking pills for relief. One day I swallowed as many as I physically could (think it was 100mg each) and closed my eyes to rest. Woke up throwing up and feeling so disgustingly sick and this sick lasted for weeks. I couldn’t eat proper food and I couldn’t hold too many liquids either. My liver was so fucked up for long. I couldn’t even take one pill anymore without so much physical pain. 

I remember the day I tried to end it by cutting open my arms. It was a cool fall day, probably mid September or October. Nothing bad happened that day, I just was so fucking sick of it all. I grabbed the razor I usually cut myself with and just went as hard as I physically could down and all over my wrists. Holy shit the blood was terrifying. As soon as I saw the blood I immediately covered both of my arms up and did my best to stop the bleeding. The cuts actually weren’t that deep and I didn’t hit any veins so I was sure I’d be okay and just move on with my life. The scars were pink and very visible for years, and by that I mean everyone could look at them and see what I did till around my 18th birthday. In March of 2018 they were basically white and no longer really puffy so I decided that I would cover the one on my left wrist with a tattoo. That healed me emotionally so god dam much. 

I have a rose on my left wrist and the stem covers the scar so well that you can’t even see it anymore. It just looks normal. After I got the tattoo I realized how free I felt; my past really was gone for good and I could move on. This year (literally on my 19th birthday) I got another one but it covers the deep purple scars I had on my upper arm. It’s a floral band wrapping around my upper arm completely and oh fuck did it hurt to get done. But I shit you not, I almost cried after getting it because I felt... it’s indescribable. As for my body after the pill addiction and pill OD.. that’s a different story.

I have IBS now because I permanently fucked up my intestines that badly. Nobody in my family knows this is why I probably have it but that’s what a private meeting with my doctor concluded. My liver is healed and I can actually take 2 250mg pills for a headache, but that’s all I can handle without pain. 

I have a great job, amazing support system, amazing boyfriend, and even though life can be tough, I always remember I’m tougher. I survived two serious attempts and here I am at 19 having the time of my life. Five years ago I didn’t even think recovery was possible and now I haven’t cut myself in probably 9 months (it fuckin sucks kicking that habit), I graduated high school (NEVER planned on that), I have a great job that pays $17 an hour (and that’s just the minimum for my trade, I’m gonna keep going up) and life is just so great in general. Recovery is possible and it’ll take years, I’m still getting better and trying to move on from it all, but it is worth it.

161,bo4b28,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,21,Coping method that works for me,depression_help,"You know how sometimes you literally can't control your thoughts and it spirals out of control and all of a sudden you're thinking about how that one time when you messed up makes you want to crash you car into a tree in the hopes it'll kill you?

Well I've sort found a good way of coping with that. It is very simple. Just say out loud to yourself: ""I don't want to be thinking about this right now. Let's think about something else.""
At this point in my recovery I'm able to just think it in my head when I detect some toxic thoughts and move on. But starting out it was quite hard. I would say this sentence in different variations depending on where I was and what I was doing. 
When I was driving I would say ""Hey, let's not think about this in a car."" Or I would district myself with a ""I wonder what's on the radio. What stations are good? I hope 105.3 the shark isn't just playing commercials right now. Or maybe I should listen to pop music.""
If I was walking down town it would be ""I should go to the library"" Or ""I wonder that store sign is still up even though it's been closed for years now."" 
Basically say out loud to yourself anything that isn't what you are currently thinking that is neutral in emotion. You don't want to go straight from toxic depression to toxic positivity.

Yes, I guess I'm more healthy than ever before. But that's not what I'm after. That's not my passion or anything.

I like doing various alone-things like playing video games or daydreaming because I'm an introvert. But I'm also lonely. I could go out and meet some people.

The only real friends who genuinely get me are internet friends sitting somewhere on the other edge of the world. But those friends hit so much different than local friends.

I have moments of contentment, but most of the time, I just don’t care. Nothing matters. I just want to sleep all day.

I’m sure my job at the thrift store isn’t really helping any. My manager has created so many rules and regulations that I never want to go in anymore, but I have no other job to fall back on. No sitting down on the clock, don’t talk to your coworkers for more than a few seconds (even if it’s about work), bathroom breaks need to be taken on our breaks or you need to be out within five minutes, you have to get a doctor’s note even if you just have a common cold... If you get off work early, you can’t come back in and shop, you can only shop on your days off. I’m trying to remember them all, but it’s nearly 11pm, and I’m tired, so please forgive me not listing all of them. I’m not even sure I know all of them, since they change from day to day. 

But I still feel sort of guilty. I have a job. I should be thankful, even though I often wish to just run away. I have a home, I don’t have to pay rent since I live with my grandparents... but living with them, and all their cats, and my nana’s nephew that has an intellectual disability that calls me fat, lazy, useless, etc., it doesn’t feel much better. I would like to just appreciate what I have, like people tell me to all the time... but instead I just feel sad. 

And I don’t feel like I can really tell these things to people. I fear burdening my boyfriend, I fear my therapist putting me in the psych ward, and I stupidly let it slip how miserable I’ve been lately to my psychiatrist, who has upped my dosage and also insists I speak with case management and move out. Which that’d be great, only I’m too depressed to take care of myself half the time, and despite the huge amount of stress my job causes me, it doesn’t pay enough for me to survive on. Not even the minimum level of survival. 

Is there no way to feel joy in life anymore? Is there no way to end this perpetual cycle of being tired and stressed all the time? Have I just rambled on nonsensically? I just want to *want* to exist, at least, instead of thinking, *”I’d have no qualms with dying today. Not waking up would be fine. If some entity just snapped their fingers and i was erased from time and space, that’d be swell.”* 

On a side note, I intend to be up a little while longer, but I may fall asleep. Some nights I can’t sleep until 2am, others I can’t even make it past 9pm, but I never want to get up.

178,dogpcs,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,17,A short(ish) guide on showering,depression_help,"  A short(ish) guide on showering. I have marked this post as not safe for work because I talk about my ass a lot. Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read.

Ah yes, personal hygiene, the bane and all consuming nightmare for anyone who cannot bring themselves out of bed. We as people try to bribe ourselves, if you get up and have a shower then you will feel better, but that bed is so comfortable, and its not like you’re going anywhere, why should you have to shower? The biggest reason I can think of is because its very very very simple. 

Because it makes YOU feel better.

We still get up to pee, what’s so hard about having a shower? Well when I say ""everything"" people usually laugh. The idea of taking off the pyjamas you haven’t washed or changed in give or take a week is like peeling back the layers of your failure onion, looking at your matted crusty greasy hair is like looking straight into your birdnest of shame. Trying to even attempt to trim the hair on your face, or armpits, or where have you feels like you’re battling a particularly stinky yeti that tells you that you suck. Noticing you still have mascara goop in your eye from that one day you put in effort is like a glaring unhygienic reminder of how completely worthless you feel. You feel vulnerable, naked, figuratively and literally. 

And then there’s the smell, as someone who has gone for weeks without showering I can tell you that the human body is not a garden, it’s a waste disposal centre of epic proportions. You smell from everywhere, and your butt cheeks feel like they’re kind of glued to each other. And when you finally get to that point where you are ready to turn on the shower and you step under, it’s like you’re a snake, shedding your own skin. And the water washing off you is definitely not the right colour. So why the gruesome picture you may ask? Because it’s a reality for so many people, and it perfectly illustrates why depression isn’t a simple quick fix, it’s a years long battle. The idea of your ass smelling and your sheets having a skin imprint on them is so completely unpleasant, even to me as someone who has been there. it perfectly illustrates just how strong the hold is on people who are fundamentally good people. How strong the shackles on our minds can be. 

So what about this guide, you’ve personally illustrated very well what its like to not shower, how can I get to showering? The answer is hard to do in the real world but its so simple to write down: do the minimal effort and get the maximal pay off. You start small, ridiculously small. Pick a body part, even if its washing your hands after you pee instead of walking to your fridge and then crashing back into bed. If that’s too much then trim your finger nails, hell, trim one finger nail,. Every single goddamn day. When that doesn’t feel like a gargantuan task of epic proportions that makes you want to cry at the thought of it, then add a finger nail, or fuck, do one and a half if two feels too much. I started, by washing my genitals. For smell related reasons, obviously. I didn’t shave, I didn’t do anything fancy, just some ph neutral soap and a bidet, that’s all, the main reason I did this was because I went to the bathroom every day and that involved putting my pants down, it seemed like an easy place to start. And I did it, for about a week, and then I stopped doing it for a day and it made me cry because look at you, you layered dirty onion of shame and disgust why cant you even wash your own ass, what are you? A fucking baby, cant even do that one fucking thing, you piece of shit. 

That’s what happens, and I’m sure it might happen to you, and you’ll crash into bed and resume whatever you were mindlessly watching as you hope your over rested, creaky, aching body will just fall asleep again even though you slept for 16 hours. It will happen, and my advice is:

Tell yourself to that what you didnt do is okay. Dont excuse yourself, but realise that failure is not a curse word, its a reality of life. That’s how depression is combatted and it is a fight, but instead of you murdering the crazy 88s like the badass you are, you’re in a room with yourself, no lucy liu, no gogo. Just you and your head. And instead of a hanzo sword you have to fight your own brain that is biologically programmed to tell you you’re a piece of shit. And its hard, its hard to fight that voice in your head. But you know what wasnt hard for me? washing my ass, I made it as easy as i could for myself, and after that one time i kept doing it, because i told myself that it was okay to fail, to strive to be better.

I know the follow up is “I’m so depressed I don’t even care if I smell, I don’t care if people see me like this, I don’t care if I die from ass stank induced shock”. I’ve been there myself. And these depression guides seem to gloss over the fact that even the simple act of caring can seem like an impossibility. Here’s what I found out: caring as a depressed person isn’t there, it has to be created. A lot of the times people will ask a depressed individual to choose something they care about and then “do it for them” comes out. But it doesn’t work like that. You have to do it, and the caring will come later. You have to in a sense rewire your brain. I don’t wash my ass because I love my parents and don’t want them to be disappointed. I wash my ass because I like my ass to be clean, and smell decent, I didn’t care what it smelled like when I started, but I started caring because when I went to pee, I wasn’t greeted by a horrible smell and a constant reminder of my failure as a human being, because hey you know what brain, its okay, I cleaned my ass, and even though I did nothing else, I still cleaned my ass and that’s more than I did before. And I can say I am proud of it.

Consider for a moment that your brain, or rather the imbalance within them are trying to make you do all these things you don’t really like, and on top of that this imbalance is also making you not care about the inability of doing these things. That’s the part you have to say fuck you to.

Wash your ass, start with something small (or in my case big, get it, I’m saying my ass is big haha, I’m so funny). And the caring will come, and after the ass, you can move on to washing your hair, or brushing your teeth, or even just trimming a fingernail, or drinking one single cup of water, the caring will come later. And when you do wash your ass, be nice to yourself. 

Here I will help you, for when you have done the one hygienic thing:

An achievement to ….:

Hereby I wish to say that …………………………. Partook in an act of personal hygiene, an achievement that should not be overlooked, a wondrous day for mankind. She or he took the time to perform this task, even though it probably sucked and no one is more proud of her or him than I. It is with great pride and pleasure that I say that this act of personal hygiene is something we collectively, as a society should be proud of and no one should be more proud than the person reading this, who took the time to perform this task.

That probably came off as sarcastic and petulant, but the message is there, Don’t punish yourself for doing something, that in my experience is the best way to break your cycle. Because its so easy to go “yeah you did one thing, but look at all these other things you suck at, look at this bed, look at this house, why is the pizza box moving, because of you, asshole”. You have to stop it. I’m not saying you need to build a parade every time you wash your hair, but you also shouldn’t be tearing yourself down for it, you did something that feels so big and so difficult that you cant do it every day, and that is an achievement.

Take the time to feel pride for your smallest accomplishments, allow yourself to feel okay about something. And even if you cant bring yourself to say good job to you, be neutral. Its okay to just say okay and try again.

Played up until 5 am then put on an alarm at 7am so i can play all day long again. After a while of being inside i went to grocery store and had my first panic attack.  

Thats what pushed me to start therapy and we worked on it. Socializing was such a chore because the feeling that i was obviously awkward was extreme. To the point where i couldnt socialize. My head was completely empty which obviously made social anxiety worse and so it became a never ending positive feedback loop that made socializing literally impossible so i understand why people just give up. Its too intense and after “tries” of socializing i used to come home and cry because it felt so damn hopeless and intense.

I went far ahead and social anxiety doesn't bother me anymore. It indeed is possible to become “normal” and not awkward although some quirks of awkward self persist but they are compensated by the positive traits of your normal self. 
You also learn to turn the awkward parts to positive or just make them irrelevant and forgetable.

Its hard but the main thing to learn is that isolation most of the time make awkwardness worse. After a while you feel less awkward although its a slow gradual process over months.  You begin to learn social skills and turn awkwards traits to manageable.

I too prefered being alone although i often questioned how much of it is coping. Of course i would NOT prefer awkward socializing and being alone is not only a relief but the only option. When you become better at socializing and begin to even enjoy it because it felt good to finally become normal or good at something. Especially something like socializing that you never thought will become easy

Of course i would not want to go back and would prefer being alone and playing games that make me forget the intensiveness of awkward socializing.. But when it becomes enjoyable you realize why “normies” enjoy it and do it all the time. 

Its hard to explain all the little details that become easier but i literally dont see how isolation will make it better. Its hard to treat exactly because its a self feeding feedback loop that makes you STUCK. While avoidance might seem like a better or at least not worse option i would tell you “dont be so sure”. What you should fear more than anxiety or panic attacks is not getting better. Or even get worse. Spend 10 years in a rut of panic attacks and it will be so damn hard to treat you will regret not taking action sooner. I did. What pushed me to get help even though the thought of getting an appointment made me anxious af was the thought of how much worse it will get if i dont do anything. I thought fuck it. If i throw up in the room of my doc so be it. If thats what it takes. I had to suppress my paranoid self and go forward regardless if i vomit from the pure anxiety.

Today she had a huge anxiety attack at school and when I brought her back to her house she was hysterical- she was screaming and crying and would not stop for an hour or so no matter what I did. I feel like I’m an extremely supportive boyfriend to her and I know that I treat her right and help her all the time. 

She told some that she wishes she was dead and that she genuinely is wanting to take her pills and kill herself today. She’s attempted it before, but it’s been 2 years since she did. I took her pills away from her so she couldn’t and now she’s asleep on her bed and I’m here in the dark looking up ways to help her even more than I have been. She’s been down like this for about a month and is falling behind in all of her classes, her work, and she hates her body. 

I was supposed to be at work 2 1/2 hours ago but said I’d be late because I had to stay home for a little. I’m afraid to leave her alone because she gets very frantic when she’s like this, but I don’t know what else to do as I’m a personal care giver to blind and dead individuals who need me to be there ASAP (nobody can cover my shift).

She’s a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not she’s making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I can’t cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently she’s been saying she doesn’t feel like it’s fair for me to have to deal with her when she’s like this, and she’s worried that’s it’s having a negative impact on our relationship.

Then I'll see if I'm overwhelmed with work, lol. Please follow me! I want to keep doing stuff like this for the community! THIS IS SO MEANINGFUL TO ME. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.*   


Hey There!  :)

I built an algorithm to help people with mental health. It is pretty cool.

I am an anonymous therapist that is tech savvy. I built an algorithm to analyze peoples needs and then compare it to the progress of other people with the same profile. Then it generates meaningful tips that emails people free advice based on what helped other similar people.

The recommendations from my algorithm have been helpful to me and to others. So I run it for other people for free (it's a strange hobby I know, but I like to do it). I have to put the data in manually, so I use google forms to collect your info and I enter it manually later. You can fill it out totally anonymously.

Fill out this google form and I will enter your data and email a list of 7 online resources that may help you. I can do more, but it is a bit of work. lol

Each response is personalized just for you! Know that this isn't a generic test. You'll get personalized resources that helped people who have a similar profile as you.

I only do 50 of these emails per week. So fill this out at the beginning of the week to maximize your chances of getting recommendations.

I hope this helps! Let me know if it does! I love feedback.

I need an extra day. I really need feedback on the algorithm and the effectiveness of the recommendations.    


My synopsis - I am a real therapist who got into therapy to make a difference, but I have fallen short of my goals. I have been in Mental Health field since I was 21 (I'm 37 now). I worked my way to the top of my profession and was getting referrals from all over the nation (big ones too). I just didn't feel like I was making enough of a difference as a therapist, and I keep seeing former clients take their lives - and it was tough, even traumatizing ([I made a video about it here](https://www.facebook.com/MentalGurusTeam/videos/397204421039783/)). I became somewhat disenchanted with therapy as it is today, and I HATE charging for services that I want to give for free. I hate that people are suffering because they can't afford therapy. I can't tell you how much I hate it (may I'll post on it someday).   


If you are interested in getting to know me and Mental Gurus better - [join my FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mentalgurus/), or please [like my page](https://www.facebook.com/). I am trying to grow Mental Gurus into something good. I am not making money on this, though I hope it will support my family eventually.   


Because I hate the idea of people suffering because they can't afford therapy - I am trying to build something entirely FREE! Something useful and beautiful, that really helps with mental health. By taking part in the google form, you are part of it. You are helping make Mental Gurus better. I really appreciate it because healing others is how I heal my own heart. I put all my money into this project (don't worry, I'm already poor as dirt, lol). Mental Gurus has consumed me as an obsession. One I want to do forever. I just hope it makes a difference. I just want to help people not suffer.    


So thanks for fulling out over 100 of these google forms! I can't tell you how wonderful it is to have your anonymous feedback.   


If you want to help make Mental Gurus better and take one of these tests, and tell me what I could do better. :)   


Oh - and if you want to get a report that will tell you about the level (aka severity) of your depression, [take this eval here](https://dev.mentalgurus.com/takeassessment/18). I wrote this myself and would love your feedback. [Here is the one about anxiety](https://dev.mentalgurus.com/takeassessment/16).

In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. 

I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music.


Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music.


Even when sewing, I sing. 


Even when I’m outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because I’m so weak.

I’m weak because I couldn’t sing in front of others. I’m weak because I’m so shy. I’m weak because I couldn’t even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go.


I’m so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I don’t at the same time. Isn’t it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I can’t sing. I sound horrible when I’m standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I can’t even sing outside anymore, because I’m afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. I’m my worst enemy. 



Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why can’t I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. I’m going to art school to draw, which I’m still bad at. I’m not going for music.

 I compare myself to others ALL THE TIME have it be to my mom,sister,cousins,friends, random people on the street or people on the internet and it kills me!! It all started when I was a kid (6-7) and my mom along with my sister used to tease me for my appearance which they deemed not pretty enough or not girly enough. Whenever my mom and I would get in a fight she would bring up all my insecurities and it made me feel like shit, she would also compare me to other girls (sister,cousin,friends...) and point out areas in which they are better than me and then she’d end it by saying that I will never find happiness and that no one will ever want to date/marry me which is now always in the back of my mind. Then we have my “friends” at school who did almost the same but they would say it in a way that it almost sounds like they were giving me advice or something. So they would say things along the lines of “you would’ve been so pretty if only you didn’t have “blank” ...etc which made me so aware of my insecurities hence how I feel today. Throughout my childhood and early teenage years I’ve garnered comments about my appearance that can last me a lifetime and it always revolved around either my face or the way I dressed up. I’m 16 (sophomore) and during my first two years or high school I’ve had people scorn me for my clothes being too old fashioned literally all the time, they would be hysterically laughing in my face to which I always laugh along pretending I wasn’t deeply hurt which I suspect what made them keep going with the ruthless jokes. Sorry, this is all over the place but I just kinda needed to let some of it out, it kinda helps. Btw this is but a fraction of what I had to put up with for almost 10 years my life (more than half my life.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/c075ye/too_ugly_to_go_out_in_public/,126," It’s ok.

225,erxx2i,False,PROVIDING SUPPORT,25,Tips to Cope with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help,depression_help,"For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a ""purpose"" and a ""reason"" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and ""grieve"" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those ""flaws"" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed ""acceptable"". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. ♥",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/erxx2i/tips_to_cope_with_depression_a_novices_guide_to/,124,"This is a genuine question, not a criticism: how does anyone journal?

235,g6k2kb,False,STORY,16,"I want to share my story (molestation, anger issues, and depression). I’m scared, but I’m doing it for you guys. You are not alone.",depression_help,"Hi guys,

My name’s Phil, and I'm an 18 years old male. I’ve never done anything like this before. But, I thought it could help at least one person (maybe even myself) so I’m going to give it a try. Here’s the story of my years-long battle.

I would consider my life up until the age of four to be quite normal; I was good at making friends, I had a very childish “romance” with a girl at preschool, and I lived in a stable household. It was on my fourth birthday where my life started to tread downhill. My parents had invited my best friend from preschool over to my house for my birthday party. From what I remember, the party was quite swell. I had cake and such and such, typical party. After it was over, my best friend invited me to spend the night at his house. I begged my parents, and they conceded. I ate dinner there and we were soon sent to bed (if you find it hard to read about molestation, skip to the next paragraph. I’m going to be very frank about my experience). Now, before I continue, I must say that I still think about this night vividly on occasion 14 years after it happened, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time. It has become harder and harder to make out all the details with the passing years, but how it felt is still engraved into my brain. It has made me feel like less of a man, and very much like a tool made to be used. Well, here I go. After we entered our respective beds, my friend says he wanted to try something on me that his father had done to him. I agreed. I had absolutely no clue what he meant, but next thing I knew he had put himself into my bed and did exactly what he said he would do. The same thing his father had done to him. I refuse to go into more detail for both my and your sake. After this point, it was a blur. I remember telling my mother about it and that’s about it.

After that night I had never felt the same. 

A year passed and I had enter elementary school. I didn’t have the same ability I once had to make friends with other kids. This was the beginning of my ostracization. As the years increased, so did my weight. By the end of elementary school, I weighed roughly 210lb. The increase continued into middle school where I hit a max, of I believe, 270lb. I hated myself, I was fat, friendless, and most importantly, loveless. At this point, my parents’ marriage was starting to show cracks. There was constant fighting. These fights primarily were a result of my half-sister who at the time was a heroin addict (I believe she has now recovered, but I don’t know for sure). I started to grow angry at this time. Very angry. Angry at the world, my parents, and myself. I hated everything. I was very eager to start fights and to stick it to people. I remember physically assaulting a number of people that I would have considered friends because they caused me the slightest annoyance, specifically one boy, I hit multiple times. I have never said sorry to any of these people (if you happen to read this, I’m very sorry). I probably hurt them greatly and ruined their trust in others.

This anger lasted until high school where it turned into competitiveness. After developing this personality trait, I lost 100lb, which reinforced it. I had to win everything. If I didn’t, I would break down. I’ve famously punched many walls, leaving many dents. As you can probably imagine this wasn’t healthy. This level of competitiveness slowly turned into sadness. With everything I mentioned up until now: my inability to make friends, my anger, my competitiveness, and my unattractive physical appearance I was one of the most hated individuals within my school. My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers led to depression. I became very depressed during my junior year of high school. I was having very bad depressive episodes every night. It started to noticeably affect my school work (at this time I was fourth in my class out of 110), I felt like I had to work even harder to maintain what I had, all I had, which was my grades. To make things worse, this is when my parents got divorced. To be frank, I didn’t cry, I didn’t care. After developing my weird personality, my parents had no value to me, but it still worsened my depression.

On a day, during the November of 2018, I tried to kill myself (if you have a hard time reading about suicide, skip to the next paragraph). This is something, just like my molestation, I have a very hard time talking about, so I’m going to keep it brief. I had decided to live with my father after the divorce, and he had a 9mm in his bedroom closet. On a day that he was off on business, I decided I was going to do it. I didn’t even write a note, I didn’t want to be remembered, I wanted to be silent. I remember loading it and putting it to my head. I sat there, and I sat there. Eventually, my mind brought me to this girl who had been very kind to me over the last year and how sad she would be if this was the route I took. So I put the gun down, and I cried.

Now, a year and a half later, here I am. I’m now on 20mg of Lexapro after my doctor noticed my depression. I still experience depressive episodes now and then (a lot more recently because of the coronavirus outbreak). I’m now getting prepared to go to my dream college, and I feel like I have some semblance of control in my life. There is a lot I didn’t talk about in this, including my experiences with alcohol abuse and my personal relationship with the girl that in essence stopped my suicide, but I didn’t want to make this too long. Now that all is pretty much said and done, what advice can I give? 

-Live for the dreams you’ve yet to see materialize.

-Live for the people you haven’t met that you’ll make smile.

-And, given the aforementioned, live the life you want. Live the dreams *you* want, and make the people *you* want to smile. 

I hope this shows at least one person that they are not alone. If you think no one cares about your situation, I do. Thanks for reading this.

  I felt ok.not just that bur I actually had the thought that my life really isn't so bad . I thought that to myself with no prompting. And I looked outside and thought what a beautiful day it was.
  At my last appointment I had early in April I was prescribed something for my anxiety and depression and I was told to not expect any results for atleast 3 weeks.
 I asked my husband to let me know if he noticed any differences and last night he mentioned I wasn't responding normally and today even said I was being chipper.
  I don't know how long this will last but I am happy to report that for the first time in a long long time I actually have hope and am feeling pretty good.

I listen and listen daily, to everyone and everything, i give advice and support, but today i was hurting and wished to share and he didn't want to listen. No one does so I'm usually okay with it.

I'm okay not sharing since my other friend is usually always busy and has her own close friends. My mom doesn't understand it so i can't tell her. My psychologist is absent due to an illness. Today the boot crushed me till i cried, and i don't cry at all.

1. Sleep: Go to Bed before 10pm. Get 6-8 hours solid sleep if you can.
2. Exercise: Walking, Cycling, Swimming. If you can, do them all and as often as you can. Forget Gyms, get out in the Fresh Air. Get back to Nature.
3. Medication: Find the correct AD dosage and stay on it until your doctor says otherwise. No shame in taking medication.
4. Meditation: Buy some good tapes and learn meditation and mindfullness. Practice daily. I takes a while to get use to it so be patient.
5. Reduce External Stressors: This is a hard one but if your job is way too stressful, change it or leave it. Not easy i know but without your health, you've got nothing.
6. Stop living in the past: If you've made mistakes in the past which contribute to your condition, let them go. You will never be able to change what has already gone. Forgive yourself, learn from those mistakes and perceived failures and move on. Just try not to repeat any of them going forward.
7. Kick bad habits: If you take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol, stop now. These are non-negotiable for someone who suffers from depression.
8. Loneliness: This is by far the most difficult to address and is a huge problem in modern society. All i can say is if you have family and friends nearby, meet and talk with them often. They saved my life. If you can't do this and you feel like shit, at least try and ring a local help line.
9. Keep yourself clean and tidy: Wash each day and put on some clean clothes. It'll make you feel better.
10. Remembering 1) - 9)

249,9ons5k,False,None,9,"If you are alone in your room right now, and you have some time to spare...",depression_help,"- Open up your window just a bit, fresh air is good for you and your (mental) health.

- Go and get a glass of water, hydration does wonders

- Clean up your room a bit, it doesn’t have to be fast, do it at your own pace. A clean room eases your mind, and you did something productive

- Put on some calming, soothing music that you like

- Shower if you haven’t showered today, give yourself the whole spa treatment while you’re at it, hot showers are so relaxing for your body

- Spend some time on something you love to do, but haven’t done in a while

- Eat something healthy if it’s been a while that you ate something

- If you’re still studying, catch up on the things you’ve seen in class, work on the assignments

- Try to avoid staring at screens right before going to bed

These are small actions that’ll get you in a more positive mindset and which will help you sleep better that night. This way you can wake up the following morning with a fresh start.

I’m 28 years old, living someplace that many others consider the Most Magical Place on Earth. I never finished college, have been used and abused by man after man and continue working my dead end job barely making ends meet. 

Constantly, day after day I scroll social media and am constantly reminded just how little I’ve done with my life.

It’s to the point now where I can’t even get out of bed some days to even attempt to address these issues. 

I never imagined when I left my hometown that I would have ruined my life and have nothing to live for or show for my years of independence. 

I just hate feeling this way and don’t know what to do anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/feadtd/feeling_like_youve_wasted_your_life/,117,"Im not sure if anyone else has said this because I don’t feel like reading through each and every single response but here is my two cents. 

Go see a therapist, a psychologist, a professional of some kind. You need someone to talk to that can help bring perspective. I cannot stress this enough ***THERE IS NO SHAME IN NEEDING HELP***.  There is no shame in potentially needing meds to help your brain chemistry even if it’s just for a short period of time while you are dealing with your shit. 

When I was 27 my most serious BF and I broke up because I was a crazy person and my life felt out of control. My parents moved me back to my home state that day and things went downhill quickly. I lost 40 pounds in 2-3 weeks. My mom finally told me that when my grandpa died she ended up taking depression meds for about a year and she highly encouraged me to go get some help. So I went and found someone. I was diagnosed with a bunch of shit that I have had since I was a kid but had never realized I had. I thought I had some minor depression, was quirky and needed to be better about my spending habits. Turned out I had major depression disorder with recurrent episodes, generalized anxiety disorder, a panic disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I ended up spending a week in stabilization because I was suicidal. My BF and I ended up getting back together after four and a half months and after a year separated I moved back in with him. Fast forward to 3/7/20; my BF and I are still constantly fighting about the same things. I had literally begged him to take me back when we broke up the last time. I’m not sure what changed; maybe I was just ready to let go but my almost two years of taking my meds have really seemed to help stabilize me. I am living with a friend who is 100% supporting me (which makes me feel guilty as fuck because l feel like a failure at life and always will be). That being said, I’m not depressed in the least about my now ex-bf. It just clicked for me for some reason. If what I did hasn’t been helpful and if he can’t see the value of what I’ve done then it will never be enough. We both deserve to find happiness. So do you. 

I will probably always have depression (I have had it since at least 12) and I will always go through periods where being alive seems like the most painful thing imaginable. All I can do is get back up every day and choose to go on. I hope you do the same. Please remember that surviving is *not* thriving. Life can be beautiful despite the pain. I hope you find it and some peace. Please message me if you need someone to talk with. 

Also, cut yourself a break. You have survived a lot. Any of the things you have survived would be years of therapy on their own. You have survived this long and that makes you STRONG. Don’t forget that. 💖💖💖 ",2020-03-06 08:05:17

257,bdawhr,False,Add a Flair!,15,This is a post for all those who consider taking their own lives.,depression_help,"One week ago my little brother committed suicide. I am not going to tell you how, because I don't want anyone getting ideas and I also don't want to get too personal.

He was in his early twenties, he had just started a new job he really liked, he had friends, he was dating, he had fun, he was enjoying life. At least that's what we thought, that's what it looked like. What no-one knew was that he had been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years… The news not only about his sudden death but also about his illness has left his friends and family in a complete shock. Our world has suddenly stopped turning and we have no idea how to deal with this. 

Looking back you start seeing little signs, small things that could have indicated how he was really feeling, behind all his jokes, behind his laughter… not a day has gone by since he left us that I haven't cried until I was completely exhausted; that I haven't begged the universe to let me wake up from this nightmare and bring him back to me.

We were extremely close and I often let him know how much he means to me and that I will always be there for him, but still… he felt alone. It was his depression that didn't allow him to see things the way they really were. And now it's too late. He can't go back, he doesn't get a second chance. We now know that he thought there was a tiny chance he might survive this, but he didn't. If you make that choice, it's final, there's no going back, not for you and not for the ones who love you.

You may think you're alone and that nobody is going to miss you, but that is bullshit. It's your illness that makes you blind.

So please, if you're considering suicide, think about all the pain your death will cause. There are people you can turn to, places you can go to that can help you. There is a way out of this suffering. I wish my brother had had a tiny bit of energy left to seek help. I know this world sucks, I really do. We have created a disgusting society that makes more and more people feel worthless, never good enough and right now I'm furious at the whole world. Please don't bow to the sick ideals of today's society. You don't have to be 'sexy’, you don't have to have a certain weight or earn a certain amount of money. All you really have to do is make yourself happy, truly happy. Reach out so someone. There is help and there are so many people who managed to come out of this and take back control over their lives.

I wouldn't wish this kind of pain upon my worst enemy, so please don't do this to the ones who love you. I know that depression sometimes makes you think 'they will be happier without me’ - I can assure you, that is a lie. It's a lie your illness tells you to make you surrender. It wants to win and to do that you have to die. Don't let it win. Please stand up and fight. You don't have to fight alone, but please don't give up.

Edit: Thank you all for your support, there's not really much I can say at the moment, but please know that your kind words are appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bdawhr/this_is_a_post_for_all_those_who_consider_taking/,114,"I'm so, so sorry for your loss. I want to thank you for understanding, even when your loss is so raw, that people aren't being selfish when they take their own life. Depression lies and twists everything to fit its negative narrative, where nothing will ever get better and other people will be better off without you. Being made to feel guilty and ashamed for having thoughts of suicide doesn't help at all.

Personally, in my teens and early 20s I was really scared of being a failure and letting my family down. 

When I really hit rock bottom and seriously contemplated taking my own life I actually felt angry that I had to stay here suffering to prevent the people around me suffering. I've seen the impact that losing someone to suicide has, even on people who were only acquaintances.

I came to the realisation that just staying alive is enough, and anything I achieve while alive is a bonus. I managed to get out from under the crushing weight of expectations and it was quite freeing. I've quit multiple jobs and I live with my parents, while my friends are getting on with their lives and hitting goals like marriage and buying homes, but I've stopped judging myself by other people's standards. 

I really wish your brother had felt able to speak to someone and ask for some support. There's such a big problem with men not feeling able to reach out for help. Here in the UK the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is trying to change things. ",2019-04-15 02:31:10

262,aagb45,False,None,24,So you want to kill yourself tonight: a message,depression_help,"Recently I’ve been reading posts from suicidal people who believe that they have just as much a right to a humane, chosen death as terminally ill people do. And I believe there may be a point where someone really is so emotionally broken and numb and darkened that suicide is the more humane choice—but the thing is, I’ve thought I’d reached that point before, and I came back. And I wanted to share some things that have helped me when I’ve been on the edge.

I want to start off by saying that I fully accept the limits of this medium. I’m not gonna pretend that I love you or that I can say without a doubt that you’re a wonderful person. I know how much those empty platitudes like “You’re loved!” or “The world needs you!” can be to someone who’s contemplating suicide. We don’t know each other—I’m a stranger on the internet, no better than words on a screen. I have no stake in your life. But I know you *have* a life, I know that you’re a real person with hobbies and a sense of humour and pet peeves and a favourite colour, and knowing you’re a person who’s struggling is enough. I may not know you but I want you to live, and maybe it’s selfish because I see myself in everyone who’s suicidal and helping you is like helping myself, I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. 

When you’re suicidal, you can only really see the positive aspects of death—and I’m not denying there are some. Yes, the pain will go away, and the numbness, and whatever guilt/sadness/anger cocktail your depression has given you. 

But there’s more to it than that. If you kill yourself now, all possibilities, every glimmer of hope and fulfilling path you haven’t discovered yet, it all ends. Forever. And you will become a statistic. Your individuality, your personality, the parts of yourself that still exist even when you’re struggling to keep your head above water, all that dies with you, and you become a body to be processed and tabulated, a tally on the suicide board, a number, one more person this thing has claimed. And people you can’t even conceive of now will be effected by your death—your pain will pass onto others in the form of guilt and grief. You will be perpetuating a cycle of pain. And you will have chosen to do it.

There are less abstract reasons not to kill yourself. You may not succeed, and instead may be condemned to an existence much worse than your current one, namely one of grievous injury, disfigurement, lifelong medical issues. Or if you do succeed, someone is going to find your body, and it won’t be dramatic and it won’t be poetic, it’ll be awful and traumatising. If you succeed, you’ll never be able to eat your favourite food again. The world will cease to exist. You will never sing or eat or smell or sleep again.

Live out of spite. Or fear. Or obligation. I am telling you, right now, that it doesn’t matter why you live, at least not in this moment. In this moment, what matters is that you live at all. The rest comes later. But you have to live to see it. And life is shitty, believe me I know. But as much as you might believe it, it’s not life that’s making you feel the way you feel right now—it’s that worm in your brain that does nothing but push you down, make you think you’re worthless, force you not to go to social events and then mock you for having no friends. I can’t stress enough that this is an illness, but it’s your choice whether it’s fatal.

I’m writing this because I almost killed myself tonight. I’m writing this to myself as much as to you. Two months ago I wound up in the hospital because of my near-suicide. I spent the night in a bright hallway while a schizophrenic homeless man moaned in the cot behind me and an addicted woman screamed for pain medicine in the room next to me. I heard an old man get a litre of his urine drained via catheter. That’s the hospital at 3AM. 

They gave me a sedative and after a groggy talk with a crisis counsellor, I was discharged the next morning. I drove home and everything seemed imperceptibly changed, even the buildings I’d passed every day for months, and I went back to my room where the night before I had nearly downed enough barbiturates to seriously hurt me, and it didn’t feel the same. I wasn’t cured—I’ve had low points since then and there will be more in my future, same as yours. That’s how it goes. When you choose to be a survivor, you sign up for all of it.

You learn who you are in these moments. You learn what keeps you going. And you learn that, at least for tonight, you’re not the person who pulls the trigger or takes the pills. You’re the one who survives.

***

If this post helped you, I’m grateful—but I didn’t do shit. You made the decision not to go through with it. And I’m fucking proud of you because nobody’s even going to know if you don’t tell them. You have come to the very brink of death and you have saved yourself, and in the morning you’ll wake up and keep carrying on. That’s how it goes. Silent and powerful victories, and excruciating progress. The world is waiting for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/aagb45/so_you_want_to_kill_yourself_tonight_a_message/,114,"As much as I appreciate this, I’m still doing it.

The worst part is going to sleep though. I feel even worse laying in bed at the end of the day.

Someone spent about 24 hours with me recently and i am embarrassed to let them see that this is the way I am living. 

My vague motivations to do something might last a couple of hours or day but nothing ever comes to a worthwhile fruitition. So i spend yet antlother week where all i do is surf the internet and tidy the house. 

I'm really scared because I am so close to giving up and i reallt dont see any of the rewards of making the effort to be worthwhile. And im so ashamed that this is the way i have been lovong for so long.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/gyohan/what_advise_do_you_have_for_someone_who_is_not/,112,"Toxic shame is real. And it eats up all the goodness we could have for ourselves. It’s usually passed to us, but our culture plays a part too. I say this because I’m more aware now through reading and my therapist. And EMDR which I would suggest to any one with toxic shame. 
Shame can be healthy, but when it rules us it can destroy a lot of good. I’m very introverted, but I know it’s due to my PTSD, and would force myself to interact with others. 

Listen you are a human being, not a human doing. Do you think the Buddhist monks tell each other how lazy they are because all they did was meditate all day and clean the temples. I think it’s a beautiful start when we can be happy with the boring cycle we are in and then expand. 

If you don’t take meds or see a therapist I would suggest it or just having the conversation with a doctor. I hate taking my meds. I have to take a big fat antipsychotic every night along with a mood stabilizer and antidepressant. But I don’t want to die.... some days suck.... but I’m not thinking of ways to kill myself... and idk if it’s the combo of educating myself (books and YouTube) and therapy and meds, but I can now say to my past self that it will get better, but it does suck to get there, but it’s better than where we were.

Don’t beat yourself up about going on the internet. There are great youtubers (don’t buy into the life coach bs) that are awesome psychologists and therapists that can give some good advice out there. And podcasts like mental illness happy hour. After listening I feel like I would gain a perspective I hadn’t before and it felt like I did something (because I did right lol)(even if my mind wandered shhh)

A great book by John Bradshaw called healing the shame that binds you is great. I think he even has some YouTube videos from back in the day. Another great one is by the university of Staniford  on how depression is biological plus the guy who lectures it is capturing enough to not make it boring. I couldn’t even read when I started and got into audible which made it easier.

You are not what you spend your time on or how you live your life. You are a human being that needs some love and compassion especially towards yourself. You deserve good things, and you deserve peace. I hope I could provide something. Good luck friend ",2020-06-08 00:37:32

269,epjex8,False,MOTIVATION,6,After Years of Struggling with Depression I've Decided to Make a difference,depression_help,"I'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing Australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. 

A little bit about me:

A couple years ago I was starting to notice a change in myself. I was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. I started just not caring about anything. It wasn't until one time driving home thinking I couldn't really care if a car hit me and I didn't make it out alive. I realized at that moment that I wasn't my normal self. I still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so I thought with nothing popping up. Then my mum died suddenly while I was home and I went off the deep end. Everything crumbled around me and I didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. I had a blow up at my boss and that was it, I broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. It took time but I felt much better, I still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole I've picked up my life from where I was at.

&#x200B;

Alright a little about my charity efforts:

I got an amazing response from my friends and family when I decided to post it on Facebook and I smashed my original goal of $500. I've still got a month to run on my fundraising so I'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.

My fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:

\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am Western Australia Time

\- Fundraising Day at my sport club on 16/2/2020

&#x200B;

How can you help?

\- Checking out beyondblue and the work they do.

\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)

\- Know of any gaming company that might help out with raffle donations? Please let me know as I would love to be able to do some giveaways 

\- If you are in Western Australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. I would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.

\- Just reading this post I hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.

Having somebody like that means a lot to somebody who’s struggling. 

Secondly, I’m not sure if this will apply since everyone is different but when I’m panicking it helps have no noise, pretty much complete silence unless I can handle music. My family members have a different way of talking, just basic hand signals and gestures of affection to help me through it. Sometimes using my senses helps quite a bit too, eg drinking peppermint tea, grabbing a fuzzy blanket, touching cold surfaces, smelling flowers, etc. A lot of times even if I can talk it doesn’t do much good. It’s usually better to just be there for them either distract for a while or help talk it through if it’s not too overwhelming. 

Finally, a lot of these tips have scientific basis behind them. Seeing a therapist can help her find what works and what doesn’t. ",2019-12-07 14:54:08

274,favh7l,False,RANT,15,TL;DR my depression is making me spend more money than I can afford,depression_help,"Hello everyone!

First a bit about myself: I'm 25 y/o and struggling with a mix of depression and (social) anxiety. I was in therapy for about 9 months and getting medication since the end of therapy (now for about 8 months). 

At first my meds helped me very much; I experienced a somehow ""high"" in the first two months of medication. I felt more alive and *me* since... well, ever. Everyone told me I glowed so much and changed for the better. I laughed more, was more active and just felt great.

The downside was that the euphoric reaction I experienced made me spend money because I thought ""well, what could happen?"". In this time I also got a new, higher paying job and one thing led to another. More money meant I could spend more, and because of this euphoric mood I felt that nothing bad could happen to me. Guess who made debts in the last 8 months since then. In the first three months of my meds I spent waaaaay more money than I could afford and I'm still carrying those debts with me.

&#x200B;

I'm so fucking sick of this ups and downs of this. I always had some problems with money, but those months completely destroyed my finances. And because of that I feel so absolutely down. I have about 2.000€ debts from simply ***SHOPPING***. I have no idea how to get rid of those debts and just as I was thinking it could not ever get worse, it got worse and my healthcare provider just charged me with over 600€ because of some dumb fees I should have payed the last months (new job and all). I hate everything about me right now and feel like I'm just a burden to everyone, especially to my hard working bf who's trying to help me with my finances. I simply don't want him to pay so many things for me just because I'm so stupid.

everything went great when 2020 came. passed my auditions and scheduled my recital last March 14, 2020. i was the last one to perform but everything went wrong because of the pandemic. my school closed down by March 13. i wasn’t given a chance to just perform by March 14. and our graduation supposed to be on last March 21. they didn’t allow me and my family were very disappointed. all our plans were wasted.

i came home to our hometown with a broken heart. i kept my chill so i can prevent severe episodes during the lockdown. i have small cries in the bathroom and anxiety attacks during late night hours. i did my best to breathe.

our college of music dean told me to have an alternative. i’ll send raw footage of me playing my piano pieces. once i send those videos, the dean will certify that i’m a graduate of the university. (because the recital is my final requirement for me to be able to graduate). of course, it took a while because i recorded a lot so i can send the best videos.

and just tonight i sent them all and felt very nervous because it’s already late.

it was checked and got critiqued. and then the dean said, “Congratulations”. and then, that was that. it’s done. and at last, after 7 years...i can finally say that i’m a College Graduate. i cried so hard my family laughed at me for my ugly tears of joy. they were very glad and made ‘em proud.

i would like to thank everyone in this sub. i may not know you, you may not know me and you may forgot that story i posted but this reddit sub helped me cope up. i helped people here too even though i myself was feeling miserable. i read some comments to some posts and learned a lot.

The last thing is that he understands that he told you because he has confidence in you, just keep talking to him about how he feels. Although some things seem irrational to you, you must have an open mind to everything he says. Maybe at this moment he has not told you some things in detail, you are not pressuring him to tell you how he feels or to tell you the whole story.The most important thing is this: NEVER give up, you can help him, just be patient.

Doubt I’d actually follow through with it, but the thoughts are there.

Edit: I really appreciate all the replies so far - thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/euduxk/just_have_no_energy_to_do_anything_all_day_every/,108,"Hi,
This is my first time using Reddit (besides just reading posts), just came on to see if there was anything at all relateable to how I feel.
In regards to the whole kms thing I also think about it alot bit don't really think I would ever go through with it...plus I have exams in a week, important ones, and I can't even think about revising it's just such a far fetched idea to me at this point, so I know how you feel... 
It's like a beyond emptiness where you only do things reactively and never proactively. It's by far and beyond the hardest thing I've had to deal with and it is so mentally draining but if I can offer some advice (given from a therapist):
It sounds lame but seriously it's worked for me quite alot: change your thinking, liturally tell yourself how and what you want to be/be doing. Do this over an extended period and trust me, at first it will feel rediculous but over time you will start to genuinely believe in what you're telling yourself and then, slowly but definitely surely, you start to feel like you're climbing a bit out of the hole. 
For the time being fuck exams they're guaranteed to be less important that your mental wellbeing, it's ""nice"" to know there are people experiencing very similar things to how I am and I wish you the best of luck sticking it out :) ",2020-01-26 22:08:49
282,dzin3e,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,38,I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless,depression_help,"First time poster here. On mobile.

I've known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating.

This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dad's side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dad's mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo.
Things weren't always perfect.

I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan.
This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse.

I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him.
On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well.
Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky.
He said he didn't love me anymore.
He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didn't realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didn't know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.
He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. 
In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didn't love me? It wasn't logical.
We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me.
Fine.

I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day.
We didn't end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday.
We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant.

Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know.
Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together.
We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination.  While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didn't want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me.
After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together.

The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for.
We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out.

During this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasn't someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasn't buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb.
I didn't want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didn't know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long I've known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasn't lying and that I wasn't just anyone.

As soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly.
I ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadn't been dating me since August.

He wouldn't speak to me and he wouldn't care to admit that he was a liar and cheater.
He decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldn't stand being with me. It didn't work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me.
Once we got closer I confronted him. I couldn't keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked.
He said he hadn't loved me for a while.
That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie.
Through all this I couldn't get him to see that he had lied and cheated.
We argued the rest of the way home.
At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldn't have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road.
I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back.

Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off.

And so now I'm just here. Feeling worthless.
I cared for him
I loved him.
But I didn't even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better.
He didn't even have a regard for me anymore. He didn't even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so I've been writing this since 5:23 AM and now it's 6:29 AM. I don't know how to feel. But I feel worthless.


dit: during our argument he brought up that I had ruined our trip to Seattle which happened the last of August of this year. I ended up taking 40mg of sativa which he said I would be fine. I then proceeded to trip out because of a bad joke. He started mocking me that obviously I had to fee bad. And I did start feeling bad because I couldn't control my mind and I was going suicidal. I told him that. But he still said you ruined my time that I could have been spending time with my friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dzin3e/i_got_cheated_on_by_my_now_exboyfriend_of_six/,110,"If he is willing to try to kill you both just to avoid a conversation, it is HE who is worthless, not you.

That low self esteem then evolved into depression and it has ruined my life...

I'm 30 years old, never had a date (let alone a girlfriend) or even a first kiss, no real job experience, $5K net worth, can't drive a car, obese, no social skills, I've lost all my friends and family because I isolated myself from them, and no matter how much self improvement I do, all I just is discover more problems about myself that need fixing.

The last time I ever felt happy in any way was during childhood. I can't believe how my family and friends never thought ""hey, he used to be so happy as a kid and now he's a boring, overly silent adult who isolates himself at every family function, I think something is wrong with him"".

My entire 20s, the time everybody regards as their best years, were spent drugging myself with video games, porn, and unemployment.

I've never put myself out there to meet a woman because I never felt good enough in any way, even when I was young. For 17 years I've felt nothing but loneliness and believed that I didn't deserve any love.

I read and see all these people in their 20s and 30s, all happy, surrounded by people who love them who are just as happy. All I think is ""Why me? Why can't I be happy that like? What did I do to deserve this?""

My mom was paying for it and she was never the biggest believer in my mental illness. There was a lot of pressure to drop out of therapy (common theme) and I was too scared to say what I really wanted to say. 

I was also getting out of a horribly abuse relationship with a pedophile that had groomed me since I was 13. I wasnt even aware it was abuse yet. I never talked to her about it. Safe to say I didnt really truly process any of that emotion healthily. 

Anyway I want to make the most out of it. I want to deal with my issues, depression very high up on that list, and I really want to stop being so afraid of that man. 

Im not sure how the etiquette of therapy works, can I just walk in and be like ""Hi I have severe crippling and constant anxiety and depression also a lot of abuse and trauma Id like help with pls thank you"" I dont wanna overload her by dumping it all out there but like I dont want to just talk about my week. I want actual help. 

I went back to this therapist because shes really nice and I trust her. Idk if shell even remember me.

The problem is I never really grew out of it. I have always sheltered myself from doing normal things that probably would have helped me break out of my shell. Now i am 26 and I cant stop dwelling on all of the experiences and fun I have missed out on because of my depression and social anxiety that i had and still have. Even as a little kid I had this problem. For example almost every first day of school I had I cried and wanted to go home. Even at a few of my birthday parties i cried. My parents tried to get me to play football and i even was told i was going to be the quarterback but I stopped going before the season even started because I was afraid and embarrassed to say ""hike"" in front of my parents. Looking back I just wish i could be happy like everyone else. I also feel like I lived in the shadow of my 3 older siblings and a lot the energy and focus of my parents was on them, my oldest brother especially. One of the happiest times of my life was the 6th grade, I was in the cool ""clique"" at school. I had a lot of friends, one of them being a girl I had a crush on for a couple years before that and I had a lot of confidence and finally began slowly coming out of my shell. After that school year my parents sold our house and we moved to a different town. I knew my parents wanted to move for a while and honestly it was my biggest fear. This devestated me. I literally was in fetal position crying for at least 2 weeks after we moved into the new house. I went from a happy kid to a suicidal 12 year old within a short amoumt of time. Like i said always dealt with shyness and depression but I feel like this put me way back into a hole I could not get myself out of and has turned me into the man i am today. I spent the next 2 year's in middle school wanting to end my life. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink. I had freinds but I feel like they werent genuine freinds, just other people who enjoyed partying like i did. Most of the summers I spent alone sitting at home. It was like that in middle school too. I remember joking to a kid on the bus in middle school, telling him ""I go home and stare at my wall for hours then i go to school"". I never had a girlfriend in high school ( just a few hook ups). I regret not joining the track team (multiple people said i shouldve, I was really fast). I wish I had an intimate relationship in highschool. I was always pretty smart but I really just stopped caring about my grades at the start of freshman year. I had a lot of angst and spite against my parents and I attribute that to why I stopped giving a shit. Pretty much all i thought and cared about in high school was smoking weed. I shouldve been focused more on joining a club and my grades. Although marijuana was a huge escape that I initially loved I feel like it was one of the worst choices I made because it only made me more introverted. It also made okay with the fact that i was doing nothing with my life and not thinking about my future. I had one job as a bus boy which i quit after about 2 months. I graduated high school as a below average student wirh absolutely no clue what I wanted to do in college. I went to a community college for a month before dropping out. While there I felt extremely out of my element, only talked to fellow freinds from high school who also went there, and made zero new friends because of my social anxiety. After dropping out my life as an extreme recluse began. I worked but it was with my dad doing roofing and home improvement type work. I only hung out with one friend from high school and going to his house and getting drunk with his family at their house parties was the extent of my social life during this time. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed. This is how life was for about 8 years. Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didn't really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself ""enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life"" but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didn't really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didn't make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause (dont get lasik). This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site. We talk for at least 3 hours over the phone everyday. This is the most social activity ive had in a long time (even though she does 70 percent of the talking. She likes talking about herself). Hearing her talk about her life only makes me more depressed because she has done so much and made the most out of her life. I honestly have no clue what she sees in me. I shared these feelings with her and to my surprise she is still talking to me, although she doesn't really understand how it feels to have depression and pretty much told me my life is not that bad. So here I am, a 26 year old socially inept man child who has no idea what he wants to do with his life. This dry eye problem is also stressing me out and i really want to get it taken care of so i can move on and do something productive with my life. I really think the military would be a good thing for,mw but I don't want to enlist until my eyes feel better but i also feel like time is running out because i can't join once I get past a certain age. I dwell on the past everyday and i wish I could go back in time. When I think about the past I get depressed and when I think about the future i get anxious. I get so anxious even thinking about being around New people because they will judge me and think i am too quiet. I also am afraid if someone asks about my past and my highschool/college life what do I tell them? I dont want to tell people I was a pothead who did nothing in Highschool. I also feel like im playing catch up in learning social skills when everyone else my age just has those skills naturally.

Please help me, anyone.",depression_help,"Hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and I'm going to not go through and re-read anything like I usually do as I know I would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isn't too confusing. It'll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but I need to at least get down all of what happened. Just need some advice/support, or whatever please, I'm not really sure what I need, like I said, I'm not in the best state of mind currently.

&#x200B;

I've skipped school maybe 5-6 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I don't even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. I've never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brothers/sister wouldn't be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe (in a weird way, I know) that I could kill myself if I needed to. I haven't skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, there's a ""time limit"" of sorts on when I'm actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I ""have"" to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, I'm not sure why. Today I woke up at 6:30, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that he'd better walk to school ahead of me if he didn't want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do. Then after that I just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 3-4 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that I had been too scared to look up before. Found out the way I wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things I needed, but was so scared that I wanted to delay it somehow, even though I was still determined to go through with it. I told myself that I would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if I still wanted to kill myself, I'd do it after that. Well when I woke up, I felt a little different, a little more hopeful, I'm honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. Now I have to figure out what to do next. I had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. It just seems so so so overwhelming, like I can't deal with it and I don't even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if I can still take them, or what I tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him I wasn't there, or what to do about trying to manage this so I don't end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week.

304,g21pxr,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,11,"How to be ""you"" when you are not sure who ""you"" is",depression_help,"&#x200B;

I am a 20 yr old in college. I used to think I knew who I was.

Example: I used to think I found beauty in math. Then I delved into more and more difficult math courses, and I eventually convinced myself I was too stupid to do it and could not appreciate its beauty any more.

I used to think I knew a lot of other stuff about myself too. It was comforting. Events took those certainties away from me, and now I realize myself as a dynamic being, and my identity can't really be defined by anything nor am I really comfortable defining it, since it is always subject to change, always subject to something I hadn't seen before that I can see now, or at least realize I can't see. Why pigeonhole myself to believing the same thign all my life?

To be in this constant state of questioning and openness to change is in a way terrifying. I feel as if there is no stability in who I am as a person. People say just to be ""you"" but the thing is I'm not sure who I am. Because to me it all depends. Who I am right now could be different from who I am tomorrow. And moreover I am not *confident* in the person who I am now because I know how little I know, and how ill informed most of my decisions likely are. This is a huge source of depression for me.

On the flip side I feel like people who think they know who they are are ignorant. I believe we are all constantly being changed and affected by the experiences in life and people's personalities change depending on context. And if people try to act the ""same"" thorugh it all it just means they are shutting themselves off, preventing themselves from being sculpted by life.

But is that a bad thing? Should you completely open yourself up to life, and let it sculpt you? What if your life has been traumatic? Should you not let life sculpt you at all, perhaps retain idealist values and cling tightly to them, maintaining the integrity of the sculpture, making it stand the test of time? Somewhere in the middle maybe?

**The verdict is I am struggling to develop a healthy relationship with myself.** In one way, I don't want to associate myself with any form of identity because its limiting my growth as a person. On the other hand, I feel like some form of identity is absolutely necessary to a healthy being with a good relationship with oneself. People find other people who have a strong sense of self attractive and fun to be around. While I might've used to be this person, I just can't put so much faith into my self anymore, its so unfinished, so incomplete, I feel pathetic.

Perhaps to find myself I need to revert to my emotional urges and impulses, but I don't want to submit to those really, because they are not much healthier than not having a self. Perhaps I need to make my identity some sort of wanderer, and gain my certainty from the act of wandering and navigating through the eternal grey area that is life.

**I DONT KNOW, and I DONT KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN KNOW.**

Someone please give me your thoughts, and thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g21pxr/how_to_be_you_when_you_are_not_sure_who_you_is/,103,"You get this disassociation, because like you said - you don;t want to limit your growth and to grow you have to get out of your comfort zone. The thing is, it can be uncomfortable and unpleasant at times, thats why people cling to their ""values"" that are negative or limits their growth. People subconsciously are this way where they think ""the devil i know is better than the devil i dont"" and my answer to that would be ""yeah.. dont be so sure about that"".

The fact that you are in this uncomfortable zone is probably because you are not sticking to the devil you know and are letting you grow, which is good. But while growth can be rewarding at points, the journey will be unpleasant and scary sometimes, where you forget who you are because of this feeling of insecurity.

That's why its called getting out of comfort zone. Its part of the process of growth. You have to stop sticking to that feeling of security and comfort, just because you don't feel fine during all the course of growth and transitioning inbetween two growth points. You will feel good and hopeful at times, and depressed and uncertain at other times, but you dont stop just because you stopped feeling good. This is literally the reason so many people refuse to grow, even when its drastically beneficial - its uncomfortable, of course, and they dread this feeling of insecurity as soon as they stop limiting themselves and get out of their comfort zone.

So dont see this state you are in as something you have to avoid, because that's directly correlated with growth and would limit your growth as you say.. Its not a dysfunction or an error in your brain. Uncertainty is uncomfortable. And its not unreasonable to feel anxious and insecure when you leave your comfort zone. Your brain doesnt differentiate when you leave comfort zone because youre forced to by some outside event, or when you do it voluntarily - knowing fully well its letting you grow. People start exercising voluntarily because they fully know the benefit it will over long term, but its very uncomfortable at the beggining. If you listen to your body, you would stop exercising. Well it doesnt always know whats better for it. You exercise anyway regardess of your body feeling out of comfort zone.

That's what is called ""growth pains"". ",2020-04-15 21:57:44

Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit. But at the same time it's honestly for nothing, I'm worthless and people make sure to remind me of that. I don't know how I was placed on this earth for basically every single person I've spoken to, to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit. I'm only 19 and I feel so fucking ugly, I've been told by the nicest prettiest girls that I, ""Look like an old man."" on multiple different occasions. Do you realize how fucking painful that is? Imagine if I told that same girl, ""You look like a 50 year old lady."" I fucking guarantee you she'd have been heartbroken from hearing that. How the fuck am I the only person in the world who thinks about how my words can possibly hurt someones feelings? Am I the only person who thinks before they speak? My own family has teased my appearance including high school teachers. I've heard friends of mine overhearing teachers making fun of me behind my back. My OWN friends make fun of my appearance straight in my face. It's impossible to have self confidence when you've literally been proven to be fucking hideous, people don't tease me to share a good laugh. They do it because I'm genuinely ugly and nobody cares about how depressed I am and how I have literally not a single person to talk to. I can't get suicide out of my head I don't wanna live with other humans if they're just gonna make me feel shunned and worthless. I really don't know what to do. I've tried to make myself the best person I can be but nobody gives me a crumb of appreciation. All my hard work literally doesn't mean anything to anyone and nobody cares. 

Sure I'm doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel  accepted by someone. I've never had a girlfriend, never had a best friend, never had someone I spiritually resonate with. I've never had anyone. I was physically abused by my father and I've been completely alone ever since. My entire existence has only been suffering and I don't understand why I'd be put here just to feel pain and suffering all while completely alone. I just bottle up all my emotions and pretend it doesn't bother me but of course it's eating away at my sanity. I don't have to be gorgeous or the prettiest man but I'm just tired of hearing how ugly I am. It breaks my heart so much I can literally feel pressure on my heart just thinking about how wrong I've been done over the course of my entire life. 

I guess the main reason I typed this all out is really to ask, how do I keep going even though I'm completely alone? How do I keep living knowing that I'm all I've ever had and nobody is there for me? How do I find the motivation to keep being a kind person when all I've been shown is repulsion for just trying to be myself.

317,e5konu,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,100,How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist?,depression_help,"Tl;dr at bottom

Hey guys. So, for context: I am a 14 y/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:

About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had ""rotten my brain""). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)

After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:

I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like ""Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me"" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?

(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)

TL;DR: I am a 14 y/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. (Skim through the upper paragraphs because I might have left something out, I tend to do that)

&#x200B;

Update: So while talking normally, I asked my dad what he would say if I asked him I wanted to see a therapist. He reminded me that I had already asked him and he said that since there are no child therapists in India, it wouldn't do me much good. Also, he said that my issue is a lack of focus and confusion (And it is this confusion that led me to cut myself) and that since I do not have a psychological problem like depression, I can just meditate and go for walks and I'll be okay. The funny thing is, I was amused when he said that I don't have depression lol (Hopefully it didn't show up on my face)

Also, I talked to him about why he had talked the way he did when I told him about my cuts. He said that he had a long and tiring day and when I told him he couldn't process what happened and got irritated (Which is his kind of go-to emotion. Mine is laughing). I know this doesn't excuse what he said, but it's at least a reason I can get behind. He also told me to talk to him about whatever is bothering me instead of a therapist, which I won't be doing

&#x200B;

UPDATE #2: Here is the link to the letter I will be giving him. If you would like, you can go through it and let me know if I should change anything (Names and stuff changed): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPqoXtyLRbuWboCQuACZyAZntW835uzHB3QQUFjYHZ8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPqoXtyLRbuWboCQuACZyAZntW835uzHB3QQUFjYHZ8/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

UPDATE #3: So my dad got me an appointment with the therapist I mentioned for tomorrow at 11 AM. I'll be talking to her tomorrow and I guess I will give the final update when I come back home

&#x200B;

FINAL UPDATE: So I went to see the therapist today. We talked for about an hour and in the end, she diagnosed me with mild depression, anxiety and BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). I have been given meds for mood stabilization and am on some sort of anxiety program. I'll be going to her once every week for at least 3-4 sessions and then once every 15 days.

My whole life my brain was fast and fluid. When out of the blue I couldn't remember something that I've known for decades I was shocked. I hardly ever for most of my life struggled to pull information out of my brain. I thought I must be getting early onset dementia (I'm 55 now). 

I kept bringing it up with my psychologist so to prove that I didn't have it he gave me the basic dementia test. I got 31 out of 32 correct. But I can't remember names of movies or actors in movies from even last year. 

Depression does affect our memory. It also can affect our normal ability to learn knew things. I've read non-fiction 95% of the books I""ve read over the last 40 years. I can't really read one now because the information doesn't stick like it used to. Reading fiction is so much easier so I've switched to that.

The weirdest thing that I couldn't believe had happened was spelling. I've never had trouble with spelling, sometimes learning to spell a word on a single try. Now some words I have no idea how to spell them, so bad that spell checker can't help. I now know how other people must have felt in elementary school. It really is surreal all that depression can do. 

I can barely take care of myself the past 2-1/2 years. Just getting out of bed on some days is difficult. Eating 3 meals, doing the dishes, even bathing can be a challenge.

It's normal to me to stay in when I have free time. I basically do nothing, just playing games and watching stuff. Recently my uni classes started online (I live with my partner in our own apartment), I'm starting to sort all the stuff I procrastinated way too long, and I got back into contact with an old friend who I play games with too. 

Is this normal routine for mentally healthy people? Like, do they just do a bunch of stuff one after another without getting really tired? Do they have breaks, and what do they do in these breaks? I think I've been stuck in my own loop for so long that I feel like a really old phone battery. Fully charged in the morning, but rapidly decreasing by the minute and any task. I think I kind of forgot what it's like to function normally, cause I never really did. 

I don't know. I just hear from many people that are stuck inside how they just want to do things and go outside. And I'm asking myself - do what? I genuinely don't know how they have energy for this. I'm not ranting, cause I'm happy for these people and hope they can do these things again soon. And I'd wish I could too, but it just seems so... exhausting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ft0evr/how_do_people_do_things_all_day/,98,"What I think is majorly understated here, is that people always want to do the thing that they can't do. In this quarantine time that means going outside. To add on that, people want to make it look like they are productive thing always busy. Most people have an assumption that not being productive all day means that there is something wrong with you, I think this assumption is just plain wrong. There is just a very slight minority of people who actually can hold up a day as productive as you are describing.

The statistics back my idea up: In 2018, an average U.S. consumer spent 3h and 44 min daily watching TV. On top of that, the global smartphone consumer uses their smarthpone an average 3.7 hours a day. Of course, some of that time overlaps and some of that time is productive. However, it definitely means that being productive all day without breaks is not ""normal"". And this is just a part of what people are doing with their leisure time. Think about gaming for example.

I think you are being too hard on yourself and you should give yourself some credit for how you are doing right now. Give yourself some credit for starting your uni classes online. Give yourself some credit for starting to sort out all the stuff you procrastinated way too long. Give yourself some credit for getting back into contact with an old friend.

338,f745j1,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,8,My motivation has completely disappeared and I'm feeling overwhelmed by having so much to do.,depression_help,"So I'm 27, and a single mom for the last year to 2 & 6 yr olds. I'm currently a sahm working remotely for a few hours a week, going to be starting school online next month, and I will be looking for a job that provides more for my family. 
The trouble is I've been battling post partum anxiety and depression since i had my last little one. So just a little more than 2 years. 

My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently it's been fluctuating again (I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate) this has made things very difficult and I've had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done. 
Well, now I've reached a point where I have zero motivation. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. 

I'm having trouble thinking, I've stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day (my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly) and I'm just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done. 

Today I was going to do things... but then I had kids screaming and crying all day and I couldnt do hardly anything. Now it's the end of the day, I've managed to eat and drink water today (more water than usual but not enough yet) and I'm just feeling really sick again. I dont know if its stress or if I'm just burnt out or what it is. This might not even make any sense because I'm having trouble thinking. 

I hate that I cant get myself motivated and actually accomplish things. I hate that I cant do better.

Especially if I'm forcing myself to do things I used to love or enjoy. I tell myself it's only temporary. It's the one thing I can come back to no matter what - it is only temporary. Even things at their worst, when it feels never ending, it's temporary. If I run out of coping strategies I just sit with my discomfort and count on time to pass by.

First, I make myself shower, then make the bed, and then I make myself clean the house. I don't like cleaning that much, but it makes tremendous changes to my mood. As a next step, I want to learn to wash my car more often. I am sure that clean windows and interiors will improve my mood and give me a sense of control, like cleaning the house is helping me.

  
For the most part of my life, I lived in a country that has bad records of air pollution. There, not cleaning a house for one week meant that the house will soon look like a zombie's nest. I never suffered from depression there. Maybe because I didn't have time to. Whatever I do, the house needed to be cleaned. Otherwise, it had been hazardous for health. The amount of dust everywhere would cause a problem with breathing and lungs. So I cleaned the house because I wanted to live. I didn't want to die from air pollution.   

  
I am amazed at how cleaning affects my mood right now. But don't expect to get out of depression quickly. Time took you in the condition you are in today. So time will get you out. It's about small wins consistently, every day. It's about making you each day count. Whatever you do, don't suffer alone, silently. ",2019-11-18 16:56:33

I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me.

I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 5-6 days a week, I'm a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive.

I've had people who tell me my depression ""isn't real"" because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression.

I'm bipolar!! Type 2 to be specific with a tendency toward depression as opposed to mania. That's why nothing was ever working. 30 years of barking up the wrong tree!  Believe me, I was not happy about the news at first: ""What the fuck do you mean I'm bipolar? Have you not been listening to me this while time?"" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more.

I met someone who I opened up to, she convinced me to get help and I’ve been so much happier since. Has it been easy? No of course not. The depression will always try to find ways to sneak in things to make your life worse like pushing people away from you, making you believe you are a burden on others, all that horrible shit. But it does get better, you just have to keep on going until it does. Even the brightest sources of lights in our world like Robin Williams can be extinguished by this. 

Today I am somewhat organized in college when I thought I would have died before I graduated from high school. I’m happy and life feels amazing again. Sure sometimes there will be a part of me that misses the depression, but when I look back at how I was and how I am now, I know it’s all worth it. I know it’s worth it when my sister runs up and hugs me fighting tears saying “I’m so glad you are still here”

All of this waiting is because I’m terrified of dying or getting hurt so I could never self harm or be suicidal. This makes people not see me as a priority. But I need help and I need it now. I feel like I lose my mind a little more everyday. I feel lost in self loathing and disappointment because I can never do what I want or need to do. And I’m so very exhausted. I lay awake at night scared of everything from inadvertently starting a fire and killing my family, to being killed by a home intruder. I can’t take it anymore but still I have to wait just because I’m not “a threat to myself or others”.

Also, sometimes, it's okay to just be in pain. You're allowed to be in pain. We live in a world that wants to smother any ounce of pain felt immediately, and that's kind of a trap into narcissism.

I just joined and it's  my first time talking about such stuff online. I've been diagnosed  with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. Up until now I've  been strong enough to overcome those small situations. And even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever i'm sort of reverting back to it. Like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i don't leave space to thinking, i don't/can't sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize I've done them. And i like  reading but it becomes hard like i can't focus and i end up skipping lines or read without remembering/understanding what i just read. The more i stay home the harder it is to get out. Anyway that's how i know shit is getting serious. Other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. Two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. I have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. it's  5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when it's  far from its litter. The past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. I barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. But a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because that's  what he does .. whatever he likes basically. Anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again. I got mad. And i couldn't get angry at anyone. I felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know it's a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldn't  stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldn't  stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasn't  feeling well but i didn't think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just don't know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that I'll be taking classes again after almost a year now I've failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression  was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool  i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I don't  know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging  person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. I'm  afraid that's  the cause but i don't  want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. I'm  not sure what I'm  asking you here. But i guess i want an opinion or advice. I'm worried i can't tell when I'm  not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively  and I'll  only be aware of it when it's  too late.

I deleted my post and came here instead.",depression_help,"This is probably gonna be all over the place. I haven't been diagnosed with depression by a professional because I'm too terrified to tell my parents, but all the hallmark symptoms are there. General sadness, loss of interest, unmotivated, always tired, self-loathing, urges to self-harm, etc. 

&#x200B;

I'm 16, homeschooled (somehow managed to get incredibly behind, which adds to the depression), and I have no friends irl. I have online friends, and I trust them with just about anything. I've been half-tempted to give my address to one of them incase I end up doing something uh...rash, if you know what I mean. But anyways, they're good friends at heart, but a majority of them are absolutely AWFUL at helping. I don't blame them. This isn't something you can just slap a band-aid over. Most of the time they'd end up arguing, going something like:

  
""tim needs this""  
""no, he needs this instead""

""that wont help""  
""you don't know that""

&#x200B;

I eventually just...shut down for a few weeks. I didn't talk to anyone, I didn't interact with anyone, I was offline on multiple places. This caused my friends to get worried, and a few of them started some discord intervention group chat thing. I only know about it because one of my friends there actually understood what I meant, what I was talking about, etc. So he joined just to tell me what was going on. It ended up being an argument between two of my friends over what way to best help me. Despite the fact I told them about 40 times that I just wanna be listened to. Now, this was MONTHS ago, but it still frustrates me somehow. 

&#x200B;

I know I should tell my parents, I know I should get up and do something, I know it doesn't magically get better, but this immense amount of fear and anxiety prevents me from doing so. It doesn't help that my family constantly makes half-serious remarks such as: 

&#x200B;

""Tim you're no fun"", ""Tim, stop being boring"", ""Tim just hates fun"", etc. But they wonder why I don't wanna be around them. Its frustrating. Every time I try to do something, it seems to do absolutely nothing, or I just end up failing. I've tried getting out more, spending less time on my PC, etc. but at this point the only thing that could maybe help is a therapist, and I'm too terrified to say anything. At this point, theres only three things keeping me from jumping off a nearby bridge:   


1. Christianity. Say what you want, I don't care, but its one of the few things keeping me alive.

2. My friends. 

3. Causing my family the same pain I have. 

&#x200B;

Its infuriating knowing what I should do but being too scared to do it. My step-dad yells even when he doesn't mean to, he starts arguments over almost nothing, he can be sensitive, he's the biggest hypocrite I know, but at his core, he's a good person. My mom is too over-protective, she gets too worried and too panicky over everything. Before they let me move my PC to my room, any time I laughed anything, my mom would ask ""what are you laughing at"", ""what are you playing"", etc. Shes paranoid. And I don't like the idea of telling her about depression because of it. My step-dad is more relaxed when it comes to issues like this, but I'm afraid he'll just tell my mom, and I can't trust my siblings either. They'd all go to my parents despite what I say. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.   


My brain is always foggy, I can never think straight. I feel like I locked myself in my own brain. I don't like being edgy or depressing all the time but I can't help it anymore. My friends get worried if I make too many depression or suicide jokes. I'm getting sick and tired of waking up to self hatred, tiredness, and general sadness. I'm frustrated. I've been like this a full year already and I see that number increasing unless I either kill myself or actually get help. It doesn't matter how well my day goes or how bad it goes, I still hate myself and end up almost breaking down at the end of the day regardless. I'm just lucky I don't think I'm ugly I guess. I hate everything else about me, but my looks? Nah thats fine. Apparently.

I'm a step away from suicide. I've been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks.

Hi there. I'm a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that I'm an atheist and this is story isn't from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story.

I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smart-ass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings.

I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. 


One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know it's wrong. But it's part of the modern/religious culture that you live in.
For example you have to say ""I love you"" in the first month. Crazy, isn't it?
Also most relationships in iran don't include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. 
And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck.


So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please don't judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love.
She told me the same.
But after 2 months she told me that she can't get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. 

I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldn't love them and I still wanted that specific girl.

I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. 
How did that happen?

8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. 
A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. 
I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs (atheist) and her style and her face. She was kinda ""the one"". As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as ""Jane"". And, I refer to myself ""Jack"".

I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off.
I reached one of my girl-friends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20.
That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didn't care.

I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited.



But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her: ""did Jack say anything about me to you?""
She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that ""Jack is into Jane"".

She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too? 
I spent a week chatting with Jane on Instagram. She was absolutely amazing. 

So, sick of depression and everything, I took a leap of faith. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown. 
A few days later, I heard jane broke up with that asshole because of me. 
I started dating her and we dated for 2 months.

Finally, I was happy after a long time. I was living in heaven. She was so perfect that I was finally happy for a short time in my entire fucking life. I totally forgot about my ex girlfriend and fell in love with Jane.

Note: Jane is one month older than me.

I lost my virginity to her. We had sex for 3 times when we were dating. So I became kinda attached to her, you know?
I loved her and she loved me sooo much. We couldn't get enough of each other.
Something to add, she was extremely jealous. I thought that was really cute and adorable cause it shows that she cared for me but, our relationship got toxic.
She fought with me a few times about those 3 girls I dated in the past! I explained to her that they meant nothing to me and our fights ended with her saying ""I love you""

One night she told me she loved me so much. But if she sees that I'm flirting with other girls and stuff, she will breakup with me cause she can't tolerate that. I kissed her and told her that there is nothing she needs to worry about.

And I meant it.
I was 100% loyal and honest to her. 
But one time one of my friends (girl) from my ex-college  commented on one of my Instagram posts ""miss you"".
The next day, I realized Jane flirt flirted with a few guys. 
I asked her what the fuck was going on, and she said I started it.
I was heartbroken, told her that was a misunderstanding, and she apologized, which I accepted.
But, I was heartbroken cause I couldn't believe Jane wasn't loyal and committed to me.

One night, she told me that she's scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and I'm in love with her.
 
Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didn't have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left.

This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys.
I couldn't believe everything was falling apart. 

She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I don't love her so her love for me has faded away.
She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and I've been acting like a kid.

Break: can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you can't blame them cause they have a lot of father issues,  but I really didn't expect it from Jane.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of ""acting like a kid"".

We broke up and she blocked me on everything. It's been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time.
I couldn't hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time.

After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest.

And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit.

Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I don't love her anymore. 
But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love.

I've been seeing a therapist since we broke up and she helped me to ease the pain a lot but, I'm still extremely depressed. 

I can't study, I can't workout, my appetite is fucked up, my sleep schedule is fucked up, I can't enjoy anything. 

I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy being single. I want to put my career and studies above my dating life but I just fucking can't cause it seems like I'm still seeking for the love and attention that my parents never gave me.

Disclaimer I'm not the most coherent person and I tend to ramble. Not sure if this fits in this sub I also posted to r/AnxietyDepression) 
 
So I've suffered with crippling anxiety since the age of 12 when my dad passed in quite a traumatic way for me. I've been through therapy/on meds for years and about a year ago I was feeling much less depressed and anxious and came off my meds yay!! 

A few months ago, I lost my job and it was a massive blow to my confidence. Ive slipped back into a depression and never want to leave the house and am constantly arguing with my boyfriend (massive social butterfly) because I don't want anyone at the house and I just lock myself in the bathroom and cry all the time. Obviously arguing has been making it worse as I feel like I'm losing him aswell as my mind.
Hes very kind but generally not the most sympathetic as he leads a very fast paced life and has been through a hell of a lot and his way to deal with his issues is the opposite to me lol.

The past month my heads been full of suicidal thoughts, I think about killing myself most of the day, every day. Like even if we are sitting watching TV I'll be looking round the room planning ways I could do it (even though I probably wouldn't). Last night my boyfriend got really frustrated with me because he noticed I'd been self harming (when I do this I don't usually even remember It really and am always so embarrassed by it as soon as I realise-do other people get this??) and I shouted something about how I just wanted to die but I just couldn't leave him on his own and he looked absolutely heartbroken just cuddled me for ages. We had an amazing talk and he was the first person I've EVER told about being suicidal (not even my therapist). I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can't stop crying, even now (in a good way) and I wish I had said something so much sooner. I also not believe that someone can love me unconditionally for who I am and that's really special. 

Our relationship already feels so much more back on track and even though I'm still sad, I really feel like I've accomplished something and feel very blessed to have such an amazing man in my life.

This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that.

Back then I thought of killing myself, but never got the courage to do so.

Fast forward to january this year, I broke up with my girlfriend after three years of relationship, it wasn't anything messy, it was mostly that both of us are busy ( we are both working and in college) and decided it was best for us to split at the moment, we broke up in good terms.

Yet for the past few weeks I've been feeling really down, I don't eat much, I can barely sleep, and the thought of just dying has been in my mind constantly. 

I'm having a hard time understanding myself, this isn't even close to what happened before, but somehow, I feel the same or even worse.

409,bpn8lj,False,INSPIRATION,9,I almost died a year ago and now I’m about to graduate year early and go to college,depression_help,"March 26 2018 I was diagnosed with MDD aka major depressive disorder aka clinical depression. I was in student government, ap classes, had a awesome group of friends, and just came back from state for DECA. This diagnose came after me starting to skip school and not wanting to get up in the morning. Naturally I started therapy and would go once a week during lunch. April rolled around and my depression was progressively getting worse. It all came to a head when I wasn’t allowed to run for student government next year and that night, April 18th 2018 I overdosed on several different medications that belonged to my 89 year old great grandfather and mixed it with NyQuil. I laid backed and closed my eyes hoping to die in my sleep but then I had a dream where I died and everyone I knew wasn’t the same next thing I know I wake up in a hospital with my great-grandfather wiping his tears away and I knew what the universe was trying to tell me. So eventually I continue therapy and fail second semester of sophomore year because I knew school wasn’t for me. I spend the summer with friends and try and get back into the grove of things. Fast forward to October and for DECA there was a fall conference that I was really excited to go to and I knew would help put me on track. I was denied because my “penmanship showed I didn’t care.” I again felt so defeated and started skipping school. My friends wouldn’t try and be understanding this time and told me to get my shit together and drop me. My grades where dropping and I was just feeling like killing myself again. This time around I knew better so I started to have sex, drink, smoke, party to distract myself from the pain. I got stuck on a island (I live on the west side of WA), would come home @3am a lot, sneak guys who were 18+ and I was 16 at the time and would overall put myself into a lot of danger. During this rebellion I found this app called Yubo and for the next few months I made some amazing friends, got into a lot of drama, and this helped meet my social needs to a certain extent. Also during this time I switched to online school. I eventually was banned off Yubo because of “threatening behavior.” But the app is trash and toxic and only gave me a small group of people that I still talk to to this day. All of my “problems” seemed to go away once I deleted the app and the day after my 17th birthday I got myself a puppy. Now I’m going back to my seasonal job at Nordstrom and I’m only a few credits away from graduating high school a year early. I started off on the top, hit ROCK bottom TWICE, but with the help of therapy, support, Prozac, and honestly going through a rebellious stage I’m in a happy place in my life and it is all thanks to my ex-friends, and the two teachers who hated me for putting me on a path that will lead me to making 6 figures a year by the time in my mid 20’s debt free while they all are dealing with crippling debt<3.

She suffers from clinical depression, which causes her job as a medical doctor to be too overwhelming for her.

She said she wanted to tell me because she knew I was really worried about her and why she hasn't been to work in the past months.

I didn't even realise that that was depression until my mom had me meet a psychiatrist who finally determined that I was depressed. Anyway, with proper medication, I overcame it and got much better, but I spent so many days and nights feeling extremely miserable. Thinking that my mother could be feeling that way breaks my heart. 
Unfortunately, that's not all she's dealing with. Her father died last week. My parents flew overseas to see him when his state was critical, but they refused that I come because I have school.

I just got out of a 2 1/2 year relationship and still havent finished my degree. I just feel so low and worthless...like I'll never be happy or fulfilled. I have no friends no job and no hobbies. Just really tired of life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g2b8z9/can_i_still_win_at_life/,88,"I'll be 24 in a week and I relate to what you wrote. I've been feeling immense regret on how I spent my early 20's. My best friend and I (only friend) wanted to attend college together after high school but my dad said I had only one option, to go to my local community college. So instead of that happening, my best friend went off to college one state over. We both have social anxiety and depression, so her first few years were extremely rough but for the last two years her SA has improved a bit, which finally gave her a taste of the college experience she wanted from the start. 

For myself on the other hand,  I went to CC a semester after graduating HS, went for 2 semesters, took one off, went again, took another off etc. Now it's been 2 years since I've been in college. I never declared a major when I was there. I was so lost and without any motivation. I didn't grow in any way by staying here and now at this rate I'll be in my late 20's just starting my career. I didn't make any friends. I can't help but think if my friend and I would've gone together, we could've motivated each other in school and grown together socially by making friends together.

So now I'm left feeling completely lost (like I have for the last 5 years). I STILL have no idea what I'm doing in terms of what to study in college. I've been single for 2 years (only had one short 7 month relationship before this). I have no talents or hobbies, I feel incredibly worthless and incompetent. I feel like I'll never be happy and just tired of this shitty life as well.

By January, I'm gonna try to make some changes such as moving to the state my best friend lives in, enrolling myself in college and start living my life despite my SA, depression etc. I've been stuck in the same place for too damn long, stuck at the same retail job for 4 years and I can't take it anymore. I'm meeting with an academic advisor soon they can help me figure everything out. 

I'm sorry to hear about your relationship ending :( I've never had a long term relationship so I'm not exactly sure what that's like, but I know it must be super difficult. What are you going to school for, if you don't mind me asking? ",2020-04-16 08:47:11

I have 0 friends and I can't make any due to my social deficits and anxiety. Going outside is pointless, because the streets are ugly and filled with dog shit and I need to breath through my mouth for most of the way. Trying to start a conversation with anyone is pointless because most of the people around here are elderly, extremely conservative, and annoying and will make it clear that their frontal lobe is deteriorating with age. Besides that, there's a lot of foreign people around that don't know English, and I never even got along with the native population because of conflicting values and being nearly unable to communicate in the native language. Cue misunderstandings, people being very annoyed with me and looking at me in suspicion because of that.

I cannot escape into the countryside because we barely have any left, and what is left is filled with rubbish, criminal hunters, and yet more dog shit. At least maybe if I lived somewhere like Germany or Sweden, I'd think how if I killed myself I wouldn't get to experience all that beautiful nature.

And I find it absolutely maddening how people chastise me for trying to isolate myself from the world. The environment around me is objectively, fucking ugly. And the only way I can deal with it is by spending time in the virtual world; video games, forums, writing. It's literally been my life support for years.

In other words, if your daily life is miserable, trying something new wont be as bad and it can help you see options and doors where there were only walls. As for spending time in the virtual world, if you like video games so much you can work towards a career there. The gaming industry is booming. Or if you're a really good gamer you can post youtube videos and get a community going. I'm also into virtual worlds (Elder Scrolls, Warcraft, LOTR, GOT). I found that a good way to distract myself from depressive thoughts is to write a fictional novel and create a world I would like to see.

Some tips from my psychologist that helped me to stop: 

1) Distraction techniques: when she starts thinking about it, she has to either speak with a designated support person, almost like a sponsor with AA/NA. Then she has to find good distractions to keep her mind off of it for minimum 15 minutes. Take a walk, play a video game, read, exercise. Anything that can absorb her attention.

2) Mimicking tactics: these will give a similar release without permanently harming her: snapping a rubber band on her wrist, holding an ice cube in her hand until it melts, and if the blood is what she needs to see then get some fake blood tabs and heat them a little in the microwave so they feel like blood. 

3) Find a way for her to get it out: cutting is a form of release so have her get it out, let her scream until she cries, write about her feelings, have her paint a picture, or try to find music that she feels she relates to (I chose screamo/metal)

Cutting is as addictive as cocaine, and releases large amounts of dopamine and other feel good chemicals into our brain due to the adrenaline rush it comes with. As with every addiction the person struggling has to want to stop and they need a very strong support system. These coping techniques are mostly temporary but they help set up a foundation for when you’re ready to quit. Relapses are going to happen, and when they do just be ready for them. A lot of cutters/self harm users even after stopping self harm will hide the objects used to self harm because it helps them feel safe/comfortable knowing it’s there if they need it. 

My Psychologist always said, “If at the end of all these coping techniques you still need to cut, do it as safely as possible by using sterile tools and first aid.” There’s also a book that helped me that directly deals with the topic and it’s meant for teens/young adults called “Cut” by Patricia Mcormick. 

I hope this helps and I know your daughter can make it through this. ",2020-06-02 01:31:17

439,ee5rgx,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,16,Are you honest with your friends about your depression?,depression_help,"I’m a 28yo F, and I have severe depression since 2012. 
My crisis unfortunately occur quite regularly (once an year or once every 1 and a half year). 

But since my first crisis I told me friend that I wouldn’t give them attention, I wouldn’t go out with them, I would avoid social media and texting. 

I explained everything the best I could, how I felt, how hard it was to keep contact and how it felt like a task/burden during my crisis. 

That maybe during the crisis I would need their help and it would seem selfish being absent for long periods os time and appear to ask for help without asking  about them. But it is what I can offer at the moment, and that when I’m out of a crisis I would treat our friendship normally again. 

Did I lose any friends? Sure, but it’s the life, some people can’t deal with this, but a lot of people can... you would be really surprised. 



I have a lot of friends for my age. 4 friends that I know that would do anything for me, even take me to their home if I end up homeless. With them I can share about the ugliest parts of my depression if I want to... 

I also told them that it’s ok for them to not know what to say or how to help when I tell them the ugly stuff,  I go to a psychologist every week and she can help me with that. I just tell them those things when I feel like I need to vent and I’m ok with them only answering in the lines of  “shit, this is tough. Let me know if I can do something to help.”

And I also have other friends that are super ok with me being absent from time to time, and when I’m on those periods of non crisis I talk to them by text and even see them occasionally to talk and have fun, and it seems like nothing have changed on our friendship. 


I’m very lucky to have them, but I know that this is due to the fact that I was honest with each one of them and I asked them for comprehension. Some of them just disappeared from my life with time, but I made other friends and those who I kept are really understanding and supportive. 



So I guess this is a tip for those of you who don’t know How to handle friends during your lows. 

Instead of disappearing without a warning and being embarrassed to contact them later, or making yourself present on their lives and, consequently, being rude or down in your interactions (which makes them not wanting to be your friend on the long run). Be honest and don’t be ashamed to ask what you need. 

It is a disease, and unfortunately it is a chronic one for most of us. So don’t apologize for taking care of yourself the best you can, even if you have to disappear from time to time to do that. 

The right friends will help you with that. 



Another tip: don’t waste your time with acquaintances. 

You need to have a good relationship with the people that is part of your daily life, like relatives, colleagues, friend of a friend. So be polite and helpful whenever you can. But don’t put your energy and mind on those relationships. You already have so little of it. You should use it to the things that are important to you.


Do you need to go to a party from a colleague from work or go out to look for s gift to s baby shower for a distant relative? Do you have to call all your relatives on their birthday and go out of your way to do a favor to your friend’s friend that you see sometimes and chat with them socially on those occasions?  Hell no, you don’t have to do any of that. Saying “no” while being polite it’s totally ok, and should be done by everyone, not just us. 

If the person gets upset because they feel entitled to your time/money/effort, to hell with them. Who cares? They are not important enough to be more than acquaintances anyway, and if they say shit to others about you, the important people in your life already know your situation and won’t listen to their comments. 


I hope these tips can help someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ee5rgx/are_you_honest_with_your_friends_about_your/,83,"It’s a tough question . My own experience :

1. Part of the reason I got divorced was because I started to depend on my wife too much for emotional support when I should have continued taking anti-depressants and stayed in therapy .  So tell , expect some support , but understand that at some point you need profesional help.

2. I tell my close friends and I think it really helps them understand when I’m just not feeling up to going out or talking .  I had a reputation for being super flaky , but now they understand why and are more liable to forgive me and call to ask how ok doing.

3. There will be some people who will always see depression as a weakness , and that is fine .  They can still be friends and can still support you , but not in the same way as others.

I did it and I’m just spent. I have nothing left. I don’t want anything. I’m numb.

Take a break and do things you enjoy for a while. At first, you may not even know what that is. Rest, relax, give yourself a break. Take a vacation to somewhere new, if you can work it out. This feeling is temporary. You can pull yourself out of it and be excited about your future again.

441,dkd7mp,False,STORY,4,A survival story for anyone who wants to hear it 🙂,depression_help,"I’ve been depressed since about age ten. The initial symptoms were nothing concerning considering I was starting to become a pubescent teenager; tired all the time, isolating, I started loosing friends, no suicidal thoughts yet but it was in the making. My family moved to Colorado and I had no real friends for two years. I made one good friend in seventh grade who later tried to bully me. My dad got more violent and angry as time went on. I dropped off the cliff around eighth grade. I remember crying late at night because I couldn’t fall asleep or didn’t want to and have to face the next day so soon. My parents, or rather my mom I should say, noticed and tried to help the way she knew how. I told her I was depressed, and she thought I’d meant a little melancholy. It wasn’t until a year and a half later that she figured out what’d been going on with me. I made it halfway through my freshman year of high school. I missed school frequently, I still didn’t sleep much at all, and I began cutting. My grades dropped and I got my first B since elementary once grades came in. My parents were concerned but they couldn’t understand why everything was falling apart all of a sudden. I was naturally the villain since they didn’t know what else to blame it on. I still panic a little when I think about standing behind my mom and listening to my dad scream vulgarities and insults over the phone about how it’d be easier to give up on me. He apologized but it’s hard to look him in the eyes after everything he’s done over the years. I was mentally dead by then. My plan was to climb into the mountains behind my house and freeze to death before anyone could find me. The morning before I was going to do the deed I skipped class and begged my mom to let me leave. When she didn’t I started thinking of how to accelerate my plan. There was a bridge across town tall enough to end it, about twenty minutes walk away. I walked past the counselor’s office before I was going to leave and paused for a moment. I was desperate, but not for death just for relief from my suffering. Thank god I made the right choice. I don’t remember how I got there but I talked to one of them, he specializes in mental health issues. It didn’t take long for him to call the police and my parents. Of course, I was escorted out of the school and sent to a mental hospital the next day. It took a while, half a year maybe, but I was prescribed antidepressants and I’m on my way to recovery. There’ve been a few rough patches since, one more mental hospital visit and carbon monoxide poisoning, but I’m alive and well. Maybe even happy I guess. I’ve taken up guitar, I’m learning how to sing, I started playing soccer again, and school, for the most part, is going well.

444,ac6fah,False,None,18,"if you are hurting, Please read this, my story might help give you the courage to fight back against the darkness. I’m always here to listen to anyone who needs it.",depression_help,"So I’ve been living with multiple mental disorders my entire life and on top of it all, I’m autistic. 

God knows I’ve been in some dark places in my life, abusing drugs, alcohol, cigarettes. Thoughts of suicide constantly creeping into my head. Broken relationships, heartbreak, loneliness. 

In my 23 years on this planet, I have always thought, “why me?” “Why was I out here with so many issues?” And I just had so much anger towards my parents for creating me with issues. I told friends I didn’t have plans past 30 years old. I told them I didn’t want to get married and ruin someone, I didn’t want kids and pass on my disabilities to them and ruin their lives too. I felt happy when I was alone and sad when I was with friends. I’m sure a lot of you feel these same things on a daily basis too. 

But I finally reached out to my family and they supported me and my close friends supported me. I quit doing drugs, started going to the gym and got myself into the best shape of my life. I went from almost dropping out of college with a 2.2 GPA 2 years ago to graduating 3 weeks ago with a 3.0 GPA and a degree in Public Relations with a minor in General Business. I built new relationships with people I never would’ve met if I dropped out. 

I gained confidence and started asking out and talking to girls who would have made me shake and sweat profusely if I tried to talk to them before this. I’ve had dates with sorority girls, and it’s proof that we can all make changes in our lives no matter how tough we have it. It’s just about confidence and self esteem. 2 things in my life that were extremely low until I started self evaluating myself. Started practicing speaking in my room. Started smiling at myself in the mirror, trying to ignore the flaws I used to see. Now I can speak in front of entire classes and my clients. Can talk to attractive girls and make them feel nervous for a change. You can all do this too. I promise.

Lord knows I still struggle everyday. I still get the dark thoughts that try to get me to relapse, but I’m trying to be a better person, to challenge myself everyday to do something new, talk to somebody different, make new friends, go on adventures. And my demons will always be there in my head, grabbing me and trying to pull me back into my darkness, but for now, I’m here fighting like crazy because I will not go back into the darkness without a fight. 

Find that one friend who truly supports you and has your best interests. For me it’s my best friend. When I start to feel darkness, I face time her and she is always there to pick up and talk to me no matter what time it is. She listens to me and gives me advice, and sometimes it’s harsh advice but it’s what I need at the time. She gives me peace of mind, she truly loves me and I probably would’ve taken my life if I didn’t meet her 2 years ago. Find that person in your life and when you do, hold them close, don’t let go because we all need support if we’re going to make it through the pain.

For everyone out there struggling, You will get through this. We are the strongest people out there. We face death and darkness and stare it in the eyes. We push it away from us and we’re still here. No one can call us weird or different because we aren’t boring and ordinary. We are strong, unique individuals who have a story to tell. You are all beautiful and full of life.

Keep fighting and remember how beautiful and unique you all are:) treat everyday like a step in the right direction. Try and do something each day that brings you positivity.

446,giuoa6,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,26,I am depressed and I lost all of my friends. I feel so alone.,depression_help,"For my entire life, I have dealt with severe persistent depression (dysthymia as the diagnosis) and anxiety. I have gone through a lot of stuff, especially toxic friendships throughout life. These past few months have been especially tough for me. I got involved in a ""relationship"" that didn't end up in a relationship due to his and my own mental instability. He refused to work together on it and trying to work on some things we both had issues with. This made me feel as if he didn't really care about me. Tonight he told me he definitely did not have romantic feelings for me anymore. After that, my best friend (Let's call her Katie) contacted me for help involving her struggling with suicidal thoughts (not necessarily wanting to kill herself, more so that the thought of suicide made her anxious). Anyways, after I helped her to the best of my ability, I felt great. (I want to be a therapist so this is rewarding to me if I can help anyone.) But then, she told me something. I have had this other friend for a long long time. (Let's call her Amy) Throughout high school, Amy and I had issues because her mother absolutely despised me and created issues for our friendship. I am pretty sure she blamed a lot of stuff on me to her mom so she wouldn't get in trouble for it. As a result, I began getting left out of our friend group a lot and was treated like an outcast. She has been a pretty shitty friend to me. Last year, Amy moved away to go to a different college, which made things so much easier for me, life was going great. But this summer she moved back to town and is transferring to our hometown college. Immediately life started going back to how it used to be. Katie hangs out with them a ton and I am just alone and don't really get invited. I ended up saying something to Katie and asked her if she thinks everyone is going to start excluding me again and I said something like, ""Since Amy moved back, everyone flocks to her like she is crack"". This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time. Katie was with Amy and another girl at the time, and I thought Katie wouldn't show anyone and this was a private convo (my mistake for thinking that would be true). Tonight, after feeling the gratification of helping her, Katie decided to tell me that the other girl she was with and Amy read what I said. I genuinely didn't say anything super mean, just that I was frustrated that as soon as she moves back, I get dropped. Katie told me the other girl she was with said: ""that is just disrespectful and out of line"". and Amy said, ""I'm glad I know how she really feels about me"". Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me. I left my group message with all my friends, which was my main source of support and I stopped talking to the boy who finally told me he has lost all romantic feelings for me. (He talked to me every day for about a month after he ""ended things"" and said he still had feelings for me for the longest time). I feel so alone and like I have hit rock bottom once again. I feel suicidal but I know myself enough to know I won't do anything. I don't want to die; I want the pain and hurt to stop. I just wish people would care for me the amount I care for them. I wish people actually understand that they hurt me and, not to be self-centered, but put themselves in my shoes for just a second.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/giuoa6/i_am_depressed_and_i_lost_all_of_my_friends_i/,81,"I’m so happy to hear that about your friends!
Honestly we’ve all been there one way or the other and usually things end up working out when it comes to friends. Friendships can and will come to an end sometimes, but it usually happens over a period of time- it’s more of a drift apart rather than a breakup, but even when friends drift apart there’s still opportunities to become even better friends in the future.

As for the guy- those things don’t always work out. Even if you said things worked out with him today, it’s still not always for the best. Sometimes life has a funny way of flowing in a way that’s best for you, even if it doesn’t feel that way. Stay strong!

447,g8x0om,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,36,How do I get to the point of WANTING to get better?,depression_help,"TL;DR - Depressed for probably 10+ years. Heavy sucidal thoughts for about 5. Is there any chance of getting better if I don't even want to, or seeing the point of it?

Alright, gonna keep this as short as possible, since I'm tired of giving my life story and also I hate myself for whining about this and not pulling myself up. I'm a 32M from Sweden.

On the surface and in reality, my life is great. I got a job, I got a girl, I got an apartment. I got a dog. I'm healthy. I believe I'm quite intelligent (although it feels like depression has made me very much more stupider and I forget things all the time). I got it all. I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I have friends (although I barely keep in touch).

I just don't want to live. I see no point in me continuing doing so other than to not mess up the lives of my friends and family (or mostly my gf and my grandma, don't care too much about the others). I have a very detailed and thought out plan of how I would end my life, with small chances of failure. I know it's not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings. I come from a broken home with divorces, drug/alcohol/verbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good. I had friends, I had fun.

Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects so I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite. Been admitted to the psychiatric ward (sry, google translate), a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week.

I've tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating healthier. But deep down I always knew I only made all these changes and sought help just so I could tick them off and in my suicide letter write ""look, I tried all these things and they didn't work so I killed myself instead"". Oh, and did I mention that I've only told my gf and my older sister about any of this, and getting to that took YEARS since I feel so embarrased and don't want people to get involved. They have both been supportive by the way, but I won't let them help me.

I read about people all the time saying ""just muster through, it's worth it in the end"", or ""therapy saved my life"", or ""I know it feels dark right now...It'll get better"", or ""antidepressant X changed my mindset completely"", or ""these inspirational quotes and pictures of kittens made me rethink my life choices"".But I just can't connect with or believe in that. And I know I sound like an immature spoiled brat in saying so. How does one find the motivation or the will to conquer this? I feel like giving up before actually starting the fight. It won't be worth it. I really can't see myself feeling proud, happy or satisfied about myself, or being the person I want to be. I really can't put words to my thoughts and feelings, it all sounds so banal.

I know a lot of people feel like this, like ""no one understands me, it will not work for me, there is no help I can get"" . I KNOW there is help I can get, although it hasn't for me yet. I KNOW it might get better if I put the time and effort into it. I just don't want to. I want to die. But I'm not allowed to and it pisses me off.

Ah shit, this turned into an unstructured, pathetic rant.

449,dne431,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,61,19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further,depression_help,"Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that I'm finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? I'd rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. I've seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said I'm 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, I'm still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 12-14 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise I'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because I'm too depressed to even crave food, I can tell I'm hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless I'm smoking weed. I've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. I'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just don't understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (Including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like ""crackhead"" or ""you look like an old man"", ""you look like a hobo"", ""Looks like Albert Einstein"", ""Do you wash your hair?"" and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is ""illegal"" to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that I'll be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life) Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone else's rule?  Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? I'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just don't know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position I'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. I'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what I'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something I'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. I'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless.

I think there is a big difference between that and the occasional feeling, which only happens very, very infrequently, that I might be so overwhelmed to do something about it.   
Obviously, the people in my life wouldn't want me dead. I have a lot of people that I love and love me, and I think that has kept me alive to be here today.   


However, I haven't been able to talk to people about this without scaring them or hurting them. I have heard a lot of 'I don't want to hear this' or 'You're making me cry' if I just begin to scratch the surface on these topics. I think the solution is that I need to go back to therapy, a therapist isn't going to cry in their office over me, and I can finally return now that I have insurance. But it just sucks not being able to talk to people.   


With my boyfriend, who I've lived with for almost three years and he's comforted me a lot in the past, he seems to be getting tired of hearing about it, or he likes to think I am getting better, and he can detect when and how, and his influence on that. I can't read his mind, but he's always commenting on my progress. Which, to be fair, has been a lot since I've met him. Before dating him, I didn't have anyone supporting me in my life, I had no will to learn to drive or get a job, and now I'm an assistant manager at a store. Not some huge accomplishment to most, but I'm FUNCTIONING, and I'm extremely happy to say that after a long road to achieving it.   


But, he has said stuff in the past just short of saying I'm 'cured'. And there are so many things I want to tell him about when he says that. Like, getting better with depression, in my experience, usually starts with the observable symptoms and behaviors. Usually the suicidal thoughts and anxieties will calm down first, then you start cleaning your room, feeding yourself, and generally functioning, and then your mind will actually begin to calm. In the last year, though, it has not really been in this order so often. Like all month I've had trouble with the dishes. For some reason standing and doing such a thoughtless task for fifteen minutes straight usually has me near tears by the end of it.

Pushing 30 hate my job, really hard finding a new one and once I do my employer sabotages my references and since there is an abundance of applicants like 200 for every job in my area they simply choose another one.

Skilled craftsman in a field no longer required started my own company in highschool which went great for a few years until it didnt. Took my current shitty job to pay the bills, tried going back to college and working at the same time to avoid student loan but during my second year the depression really hit me and I dropped out and the last two years have been a constant struggle to come back mentally. I don't really enjoy anything anymore the only thing that keeps my mind occupied on more positive thoughts is spending a couple hours every day at the gym but even that is starting to diminish in effect. Pretty much isolated myself socially since I just feel worse trying to hang out with my friends.

 June 2015 I suffered a stroke and before this happen I had a heart attack(congestive heart failure) in January 2009. At the time of the heart attack I was working in law enforcement which I think contributed to me having this along with poor eating habits. 
 I was in the hospital for the better part of a month and many of you know being in a hospital that long can lead you to having some pretty bizarre thoughts so I think that was the start of my first bout with depression. Never having dealt with it I didn't recognize or understand  what I was going through so I never got help with it, but I knew something wasn't right. Moving along to June 2015 as I mentioned I suffered a stroke which paralyzed me from my upper thighs down and I had no feeling at all and was wheelchair bound and most of the time bed ridden and it really took a major toll on me and my life. After being told 3 times that I'd never walk again and really not being able to do anything for myself, it put me in a very dark place and that's where I  started recognizing what I felt in 2009 but on a different level. I was hearing things, I was seeing things and having vivid dreams about death and I  was the killing myself each time. I also felt physical pain, inside I was so afraid but didn't wanna tell anyone about what I was going through so I put up a fake smile and pretended to be happy when I really was dying on the inside. What brought everything to the point where I wanted to end everything was one day I was home alone my son was at school and I was very thirsty so I rolled over to the fridge to get water but it was all the way to the back of the fridge. Keep in mind at the time I was in a very small wheelchair because I couldn't afford one for my size, and when I reached to get the jug the chair tilted forward and I almost was thrown out of it. Filled with anger and disgust feeling like I was burden to everyone I rolled the chair to my room and I was crying I couldn't see straight my head was fogged up I went to my closet and grabbed my AR15 and rolled back to the kitchen table put 2 shells in the clip, put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. To my surprise the gun didn't fire so now I'm really crying and pained I pulled the trigger again and the gun didn't shot again something it's never done before. I felt so low because I  said I can't even do this right, took the gun threw it on the floor and went to get all my pills I knew that would work as I'm coming down the hallway something said look up and when I did I saw a picture of both my kids and I  screamed so loud crying thinking about what I almost did, still holding my box of pills. I almost took myself from my babies!! Not even 20 minutes after all this happened my mom walked in my house and I grabbed her crying I've never hugged and held onto my mom so hard in my life. I started telling her about what I was about to do and what I had been going through I INSTANTLY started feeling a calm come over me. For years I was embarrassed to tell anyone my story and how God spared my life that day.

He said he was on a game with a bunch of ""big kids"", and they made fun of him for his voice, and they booted him out. I started talking to him and told him about my personal story about being bullied and stuff like that. After a while, I asked him if he wanted to join a game with me that had actual players. He said yes, and as we both picked the same team, I said over the mic, ""Let's get 'em, dude!"", and he excitedly said, ""Yeah, let's get 'em!"" And... Our team lost. But he didn't care. He was just so happy that he had someone nice to game with that wouldn't make fun of him. We can all learn a lesson from this. At one point in our lives, we all were in his shoes.

Last night I finally got to talk to a friend I've been feeling a lot of hurt over, it's not all better, but certainly just being able to have a conversation helped.   


Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better. Sometimes multiple conversations are needed,  sometimes switching therapists or trying multiple jobs is necessary -  the healing is there, it just takes effort.

I've never felt fine, in my 31 years I can't remember actually feeling happy. Sure I smile and pretend I'm ok to everyone I know. I get myself to work each day too, but only because it's a routine. 

Pretty much twelve months ago something happened that triggered me to be bad enough that I couldn't sleep and I was having panic attacks about nothing.  So I finally saw a doctor and she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and stress... And referred me to see a psychologist but I've had bad experiences with councilors when I was really bad at uni. So I got anxious about it and never went. I didn't want to be judged for what happened either.

I've tried to reach out to my partner, but she has anxiety too. If I lean on her too much she drops her bundle. She tells me she's happy and relentlessly reminds me that she wants to get married and have kids because we're getting older. I've told her that I'm not having kids until I feel better, then I smile once and some how in her mind that makes me better. Otherwise we work really well together, except I never really feel like I feel in love with her. 7 years on I'm still waiting for that spark.

My family is fine, nothing bad ever really happened and we all talk, but it feels like they wouldn't notice if I wasn't around. They are so self obsessed, they call me to whine about the mundane things in there lives but never really ask how I am or if they do don't listen to what I have to say.

I hate my job, sure most people do, but I find it so sole destroying. Feeling so shitty, I find it impossible to apply for others. I feel so trapped.

I don't really have any friends I feel I can trust. At any rate I never let them see the depressed me, just my well practiced smiling facade.

Ultimately I feel so incredibly lonely and isolated. Ive thought about leaving everything behind and taking a trip. Riding to Alaska and back again type thing. I've thought about breaking up, but I only feel like I would be more alone.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either trapped in this terrible no man's land I've created for myself. Reddit can you help me figure my shit out.

I am not a doctor in any form. Therapy is always the best course of action or so I have been told several times. Depression is like a cancer except in your mind. If you look at some cancer patients you can not tell they have cancer unless it's severe or they are in chemo. Some even go undiagnosed for years. The same with your mental disease unless you are in a psychiatrist hospital or it's very severe most people can not relate nor understand nor see if you are fine or not. So far everyone has the same symptoms when it comes to this disease those feelings of hating your job, not feeling like you can trust anyone, not feeling good enough nor happy enough nor wanting to be alive nor dead. The feeling of just feeling stuck. I say all of this so that you can be aware of the signs and next time not put the blame on your job or family members that reach out to you. Sure they reach out with their problems but they reach out. Recognize the signs and fight your mind to see the positive through it instead of just the negative in it. Our mental disease loves to trick our mind to think negatively always even in occassions when there is no need. I deal with people who call upset and angry because they did not get their items delivered. Yes, I do say from time to time this job sucks like we all do but like a person with an alcohol disease I know better than to dwell on that and quickly remind myself of the positive aspects of my job or what the money for that job is helping me pay for. We do not have the luxury to dwell in sadness like others. We must keep ourselves in check and recognize the signs of depression. Such as lack of trust, sadness, anger, worthlessness ect and not only go against those feelings but step out of our comfort zone to do it. Having my goals written on a poster on my wall and happy pictures help remind me why I am still alive and where I am heading to on my sad days. I hope this helps. Also the reason your family call you to vent or with their problems is because you are probably an excellent problem solver and great listener. Which, I have notice is the one thing about having this mental illness most of us are excellent problem solvers and multitaskers. I pray this message finds you, helps you and you start exploring the positive side effects of this unfortunate illness/ disease.

486,amtpud,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,12,Does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down?,depression_help,"The best way I can describe how I feel is: feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life.

I can feel emotions. When I’m with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the happiest) I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I can’t seem to get past a 5 at most. It’s like my brain is saying “this is funny you should laugh and feel happy” but I just don’t feel that? At least not fully. It’s like my 5 is other people’s 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much they’re in tears and can’t catch their breath I’m only chuckling, even though I *know* the situation is funny. I can’t even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile it’s like i’m not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smile/laugh the outside physically changes but inside I don’t feel anything. It almost feels as if I’m acting but I’m not because I do know the situation is funny. It’s like there’s a disconnect somewhere. It’s hard to explain. 

And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyance/anger and sadness, but even that’s toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/amtpud/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_saturation_in/,80,Do some mushrooms 🍄 ,2019-02-03 20:37:14

Second, now is a time for you to just let you thoughts be whatever they are. They're just visiting you now. You thoughts, for better or for worse, will change as the world gets back to moving again. This is mindfulness. Your boredom and panic over things not going normally are very temporary.

That your graduation invitations, cap, and gown are in a box is a unique ""souvenir"" from this historic event. Your senior pictures are just as valid as they ever were.

492,bipuwz,False,STORY,21,I think I'm losing control. I'm getting therapy and have the support of family and friends and it's not getting better.,depression_help,"From Mid December to March I witnessed my girlfriend's (both mid 20's) steep decline into depression and felt totally helpless. I've been working with my own therapist lately and I've come to the realization that during her depression, I went through a steep decline in self-esteem because of the immense shame I was feeling.   


I feel totally inadequate as a person. I wasn't funny enough to cheer up my girlfriend, I wasn't smart enough to find a solution for her, I wasn't strong enough to save her. At the lowest point in her depression, She started cutting, drinking and smoking. She also completely pushed me away and started hanging out with people we both used to describe as ""toxic"" when things were good.  


I tried my best to support her with what I knew at the time. I always told her she wasn't alone and that I was there for her, I encouraged her to seek help from a therapist/medical team. When she asked for space, I tried my best. I never pressured her to be intimate (her depression stems from sexual assault in the past), I avoided her triggers (the one's I knew about). I do have regrets though, I know I could have been a better listener. I tried to fix things for her even though I know now that I couldn't.

&#x200B;

In February she asked for complete separation for a few weeks so she could work on herself and I did that for her. It was the hardest time in my life. I was so scared for a number of reasons and I constantly ran through scenarios in my head ranging from ""she's having fun without me and doesn't want me"" to ""she's going to commit suicide"". We met up once 2 weeks into no-contact and I was in a bad place. I felt totally rejected and I was very vulnerable in front of her. I cried in her car for about an hour and she tried to comfort me. I know she wasn't in a place to support me, but I was a mess.  


After a few weeks of no-contact, we met up again and she had decided she needed to work on herself and try and heal, and that she couldn't be in a relationship at the same time. She broke up with me the day before my first scheduled therapist appointment. I also think she felt guilty for my decline in self-esteem over the past few months and thought that I would be better without her in my life.   


After 6 weeks I've gotten to a point where I understand that neither of us were in a position to support each other the way things were. I'm grappling with serious shame because I continue to blame myself for her depression, as well as the ways I've acted since breaking up. In the first few weeks, we saw each other a few times, and one day she was really upset and I was able to comfort her until she calmed down. After calming down, she told me she loved me and tried to kiss me. I talked with her after this and told her I'm always here to listen and support her, but I couldn't hear her say ""I love you"" or go back to being in a relationship. She apologized and since then we've barely talked.

&#x200B;

Through friends, I've found out she's doing quite a bit better and she's finally having more good days that bad. She's on the road to recovery without me, and I feel like I'm still in a downward spiral. She won't talk to me at all, she deleted me on facebook and our mutual friends are starting to get fed up with me because she's all I can talk about. It feels like every interaction I have with people,  I twist into a narrative that I'm a bad person. I feel so ashamed that I couldn't help her, and that now that she's starting to do better, I can't just feel happy for her and leave it at that. I'm feeling jealousy whenever I think of her being happy, because it's not with me, and then I feel guilty for not being able to happy for her recovery.

I am super insecure in my friendships and relationships, not about the other person, but about me.

I have autism, its incredibly hard for me to read specific emotions, and also ""read the room"" as it were, which has lead to some serious issues with human interaction in the past. I overshare, overanalyze and overthink EVERYTHING. And it leads to me constantly feeling like I'm not worthy of any relationship, not worthy to feel emotions that I do feel, and CONSTANTLY question if what I'm feeling is fair, or even my own damn fault.

I'm deeply in love with my partner, he's everything to me, but I can't identify anything he does that annoys, or frustrates me. He has told me in the past things I do that frustrate and annoy him. He has said certain things that made these feelings of inadequacy worse. He didnt mean to hurt me, he deserves to be honest about these things, and I have been doing my best to work on them and better myself. 


But ALL OF THIS, together, has made me a depressed, anxious and nervous wreck. I want to be healthy for him. I want to work on myself and be my best. But I also want that for me. I want to be independant and secure in knowing that even though I do have things to work on, I'm still...worth it. Worth his trouble, worth his patience, worth his love.

Yet I think about suicide every day. But I feel like I don't have a right to. Other people don't have a lot of the things I have. I'm objectively very lucky and have everything I could want to be happy. So why is life so hard?

I've started drinking almost every day. I'll go to the bar alone and drink. I'll drink until I get sleepy. Then I go home, and sleep. The next morning I wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. Then after work I hit the bar again. Alone.

I'm just so lonely. Why don't people like me. I try not to be an asshole. I really do. I don't think I'm an asshole? But I think people are uncomfortable around me. I think I sour their moods. I try not to be negative though. I try really hard.

I feel my youth wasting away. I feel the passage of time very heavily. These are supposed to be some great years. Maybe even the best yesrs. Single, big city, acceptably good looking. College certainly wasn't the best years for me. So maybe this is when my life is ""supposed to"" peak?

But I have no friends. I have no one to hang out with. I don't have a girlfriend. I have no one I connect with deeply.

I've tried cognitive behavioral therapy. But as soon as I stopped going (feeling like I was fixed) the problems began again. I've been medicated for depression consistently for years now. I've even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. Improved my diet. Stopped smoking weed. I feel like I've done everything.

What can I do now? I feel trapped. I wish I would just die. Life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass can't take advantage of it. Someone with a better personality or someone more capable would have a very happy life in my skin.

I’m not exactly doing great mental healthy wise, especially seeing how I haven’t seen my friends for 23 days now. Yes, I’ve been counting. And I don’t know why. All I know is that I might not make it. Online school has been stressing me out beyond belief. The work load has just tripled and I’m constantly rushing to get shit done. We’re running out of food, with little way to get more. My mom can’t go to work because she got infected. She won’t see another paycheck for god knows how long. I can’t go find work because everything’s closed, and I too got infected. The money I have now won’t be enough.

All I can do now is lock myself in my room. Doing endless amounts of homework and waiting for the virus to kill me. Because it might. I have asthma. It hasn’t gotten to that point yet but.... at this point I want it to kill me. I don’t know when this will all be over, and I’m losing everything. I’m close to losing my friends.

I’ve been on medication for quite some time now and I’ve been able to manage things up until late. I’ve been working for this big company for about 4 months now and had nothing but good experiences throughout.

Last week I experienced my first panic attack. It was a ride. These attacks went on for days. And once I was able to see my doctor we found out that I had panic disorder, and that my depression and anxiety were contributing to the development of this new disorder. We discussed what I’ve been experiencing and she advised me to resign from work. I decided not to do that and try to work on and power through it, but it only made things worse. 

Fast forward to today, I decided to resign from my company because my conditions were getting in the way of me being able to do the work that was expected of me, and it’s been taking a physical toll on my body as well. I had to explain to my superiors why I decided to resign, and I did my best to explain to them. To my surprise they didn’t ridicule or judge me. They gave me encouraging messages. They gave me support and understanding.

This year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. It's stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, I don't worry about the exams. So in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.

Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I won't elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle.

Everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these ""anger moments"". 

It's tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). I seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. I don't know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. It's masculinity, right? If we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?

I don’t know why all of a sudden my normal semi-quiet cries have turned me into a screaming mess. I feel like a child again. I used to have these temper tantrums when i was a kid-flail on the couch & tense my muscles with frustration. I thought i had grown out of that a bit ago but it seems to be back.. I’m a highly sensitive person so anything can set me off into tears-which is my bodies way of releasing the stress i hold in. But it’s just so frustrating. I just like scream cry of frustration because i can’t like let something go, i don’t even know. When a bad thought is on my mind, or even an expectation that i don’t believe i can accomplish/seems to hard to complete, i just get so frustrated that i can’t accept it or take it not as negative as i did, so i like scream and crying for like 20minutes-which if you have ever done, is pretty dehydrating. And when i’m in that “zone” it’s like i can’t even think to help myself, i just feed into the emotions i feel. It’s like i kinda go crazy for a bit, then after i have that guilty shameful feeling of feeling like i acted so childlike & weal & incapable of helping myself. 

Is this a normal response to someone who has been depressed & anxious daily for the past 10 years ? (i’ve been in&out of therapy since then too)

What’s another stress outlet besides crying? (like taking a walk or drawing is not considered a stress outlet for me because it actually causes me more stress; ex- walking outside in public makes me SO anxious/stressed cuz of my social anxiety) plus it doesn’t seem like it “releases” any stress because i don’t feel a relief, i just feel the same..",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ecfblv/am_i_the_only_one_who_still_acts_like_a_child/,77,Maybe scream into a pillow?

I think my oficial first diagnose was in 2015, and since then I tried getting professional help. The first few times didn't work very well, and I would end up dropping the medication.

The last treatment I've been on, however, seems to be working. I'm not as blindly optimistic as to say ""I'm cured!"" because no, of course I'm not. I still have problems, I still have consequences of those years of sickness that I have to work hard to overcome. But, for the first time in so, so long, I have hope that I can do it.

I know that feeling oh so well, and it pains me to think about those days when I felt like that. And I know many of you feel that way right now.

I tried different treatments, I visited different doctors, I took different medications. It has been a long process of trial and error. Along the line bad things have happened in my life; a few years ago I lost my grandmother, and I've also buried four of my cats (they are like my babies to me, you'll understand if you have pets). My life is not perfect and rose colored. So it's okay if yours isn't either.

The only advice I can give you is that you keep trying. Get help, both professional and from family and/or friends. Also places like this sub. Just because we're a bunch of strangers in the internet, it doesn't mean you can't ask us for help. There will always be a hand there to help you, even if you can't see it, even if you don't believe anyone will care. That's your illness talking. There is always someone to help you.

And finally, with enough time and help, I hope you can get better. Just like I am.

530,bi6j9b,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,12,Guy I have been dating 2 years opened up about depression after 2 years and then disappeared??,depression_help,"Hi all,

This is my first post, I am totally new to the Reddit community! So, I have been dating someone truly special to me the last couple years, and he has had a few depressive spirals since about a year into things. The most he would reveal after I would ask to get together, is that he was in a bad head space where he couldn't get out of bed sometimes and felt hopeless and as though he was in a hole. He is a very social and outgoing guy, so obviously this was very out of character for him, but I never wanted to pry or push him to talk about it, and would just offer my support and understanding and let him know I was there if he needed anything. When we would see each other next, he'd not speak a word about it, only ever opened up in a lengthy text about what was going on with him.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a couple months ago, I tried to make plans for a Friday night, he happily agreed, and then the next night cancelled, saying he was super depressed, couldnt get out of bed, and never wanted to leave the house again. I gave him space and he asked to go out 5 days later. We went to dinner and he completely opened up about his illness, revealed he has experienced it on occasion for the last 3 years, and admitted he had a borderline suicidal thought for the first time. Like he understood why people take their own lives. He was so incredibly open and vulnerable about it, I was so proud of him. Afterwards, thinking I felt closer to him than ever before, I went out of town, came back and asked to get together, only to have him disappear. He Would take 24 hours to respond to texts, wouldnt see me. He eventually texted me saying we should just be friends but meet up and talk. Its been incredibly difficult to get him to follow through on this.

Here are some things have helped me

1. Idoser - i listen to idoser every time I’m feeling overwhelmed or simply want to escape reality for while..
2. Listen to music and podcasts, no matter what you are interested in whether you love music, your favourite radio show. 
3. Exercise - exercise is probably the last thing you want to doing you are feeling depressed.. but it can be your best friend and better way of coping.
4. If you find the groups that nhs/council runs for depressed people to meet other depressed people is not your thing. Bunk them off and find something else.. if else fails use the net.
5. Get into nootropics, we all love that we’ve accomplished things but often our depression has clouded that judgement and we cannot focus but we’ve got that mountain of paper work sitting on our desk.. google nootropics and order order  a bottle or two, get some from Holland & Barrett 
6. Do you have a hobby you love, perhaps think about getting one or two that suits you and suits your personality. There’s no point in joining a sports group if you hate socialising or too anxious/depressed or paying out a subscription fee if you don’t use it..
7. Feeling lonely and isolated, go on PenPal sites, chatrooms, forums and meet people that way.. that way you don’t have to worry too much if they disappear you can go and find someone else. Less effort required.. you don’t have to panic every time. Are they gonna turn up?? You can turn your computer on or your mobile any time of the day and get chatting.
8. Make use of that button your mobile called “do not disturb,” we all have those days when don’t feel like talking or we simply want to binge watch that new drama in peace and don’t want to be interrupted, make use of do not disturb and turn your notifications off. I did this last week, I didn’t give a rats about every day problems, daily grind of life, i had done the activities I wanted to do for the day..and I simply had it with life.. so I did it and felt lots better.

The relationship between opioid abuse and depression is bi-directional, meaning that suffering from one increases the risk of the other. Opioid abuse is defined as using a prescription opioid for non-medical reasons or using it longer or in greater amounts than what was prescribed by a doctor, and opioid abuse has been linked to higher rates of depression.

545,dhdgjm,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,14,Intrusive Thoughts - My Technique For Banishing Them,depression_help,"Crossposted from Depression.

OK, first off, I am not a doctor. I'm just a guy who has been dealing with his own depression for the last 40+ years.

One of my most persistent symptoms is the host of intrusive thoughts I get. Specifically, the ones where your brain makes you ruminate on painful or embarrassing things that happened in your past. It's like you can't help but have to sit there and relive it over and over again. It's been the toughest thing for me to get rid of.

Anyway, I finally realized that I needed to break the cycle, and...to make along story short...I have a technique that actually seems to work. I've been using it for the past couple of months, and for this particular symptom, it seems to work pretty well.

First off, the tough parts. You have to be **willing** to stop the cycle...you can get addicted to it without realizing it. Then, you have to start **realizing** that you are doing it, and try to realize it *as close to the moment that you start doing it*. I'm not kidding when I say that this is the toughest part, mostly because it means diverting your behavior into something that is new to you (which is never easy). If you can do this, you really are halfway there.

Next, you tell yourself that you don't have to live in that moment, but instead have to live in the NOW. Nobody can change the past, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. Nobody is keeping score but you, and you don't have any reason to continue doing it. This should be a little bit jarring, like it's shaking you awake, but embrace the startling aspect of it.

Finally, in this moment...distract yourself. Look for anything else to think about besides the intrusive thought that you were thinking about originally. This will keep you from immediately sliding back into the old pattern. I have found that, for me, thinking of a bunch of shallow topics in succession will do the trick. ""That's a pretty tree. Hey, I'm coming up on Main Street. That car has Florida plates. My feet are very warm right now. There's a grade school. I wonder what their mascot is."" ...You get the idea. Keep it up for a full minute if you can.

That's it, that's all there is to it. It took longer to explain it than it typically takes to do it (once you get good at realizing when it happens).

Maybe this has been done before, and the technique has already been invented. I honestly don't know, nor is it particularly important to me. I just want to put this out there in the hope that it might help someone else like it helped me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dhdgjm/intrusive_thoughts_my_technique_for_banishing_them/,75,"In a nutshell, this is how I did it: I'd give myself permission to leave my anxieties and negetive thoughts for a few minutes while I went for a run. 

While running, I say OUT LOUD ""I am in control of  _________"" and I'd give myself a tiny task and execute it immediately, like pushing up my sleeve. 

I'd do this for about 10-15 minutes. All different tasks. No repetition. 

This engages a bunch of areas in your brain and it's too busy to keep the depresssive thoughts floating around too. 

There are a bunch of benefits to this exercise, including getting your prefrontal cortex in touch with reality. The automatic negative thoughts are not based in reality and the pfc loses some ability to discern. 

The big thing is creating a too that forces the depressive thoughts OUT. Passive things like drinki g with friends, or driving listening to music are all  passive and you have to rely on an external thing to take away your depression. It's being able to force your depression out at your will that is so very critical and kudos to you for finding a way!!!!

Fleeting dreams, intrigue, friends and existence
A light shines from somewhere unknown to me
I exist briefly as a flicker, a dance, an enigma
People passing by catch a glimpse, they turn
I'm unique, fascinating, unexpected
Then in an instant I'm old, boring, unworthy of attention
They continue on

No shortage of company, many have danced beside me
But time is not everlasting and as quick as they join me they are gone
My darkness is mysterious then haunting
And soon the light moves away as well
I fade, blend, vanish
Now as quickly as my meaning and purpose arrived its gone
I am lost in obscurity and darkness
Expecting no more life then the brief encounter of another light

Forever alone, I simply wait
Anticipating nothing more than the brevity of the lighted moments that bring me to life
Until one day the lights stop coming
Until one day the darkness becomes my grave
This is what I am
And though my absence will be noted
I will be consigned to oblivion without pause or care! 

I wrote this as a way of expressing how I feel when I'm in my depression... It's not easy finding your way when the darkness is all consuming, but you can. When I started opening up and being honest with people about where I am at, I found out who my true friends are and who my superficial friends are. Through the true friends, after a long stumble, I found a kindred spirit. At 30 years of age my wife had lost both parents to cancer and lived 4hrs away from her nearest family, she was in a bad place too and understanding flowed both ways between us. There exists a person for you out in the world but if you keep looking at all the other couples and comparing yourself, you may miss them.

I crashed a bit today again - keeps happening a lot recently - but I found myself thinking to take all my pills and overdose to die. This is not okay, and I haven't felt this bad for years. I'm not going to do it, but I feel like I really want to. I have no irl support nearby, as I'm stuck in a country I'm not from and cannot go home. And obviously lockdown doesn't help. I have tried to commit suicide in the past so I know I am capable of it, but I don't actually want  to. I just want to not hurt so much, and I want to go home. All the stress I'm experiencing is quite literally breaking my body and brain, physically and emotionally. I know it could always be worse, but I am absolutely desperate. I have no idea what to do. I am hyperventilating and crying nonstop and having a complete meltdown. Please help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g3mcqe/feeling_very_suicidal_and_really_need_some/,71,"Hey,

I hope you’re feeling a little better now, or at least getting some sleep which will help.

I’m not really good at things like this, giving out guidance or advice in situations where I feel like what I would say might not help the situation overall. However, I do have something that you could find comfort in.

A few years ago (3 to be exact) I was quite suicidal myself, I was depressed and anxious about everyday life and I felt like I wanted to kill myself, but I couldn’t. I described it as ‘casually suicidal’. I’m not sure if this is a thing, but I thought of walking in front of traffic, jumping out windows... you get the jist.

Back then, I was lucky to have a large support group, with my family and friends etc. but no matter who I spoke to, I still felt so alone. 

I was browsing through my Twitter DMs the other day (I never use twitter, very rarely but I don’t post etc) and I found a DM to an account called “Please DM me if you are feeling low / depressed” or something like that, I had reached out to this complete stranger 3 years ago in utter desperation, an individual who had set up an account to chat to people who were having issues, I went online and literally listed my problems. The person replied and were helpful at the time but it didn’t really mean much to me then.

Reading back on that conversation really put things into perspective, back then, nothing anyone could say or do would make me feel like I had worth or value, anything like that. I couldn’t find any degree of hope in my life then and it was evident through my messages and how I remember feeling.

Nowadays, things are really different. I feel alive every single day, I don’t have many negative thoughts, I truly feel like time has helped me become what I can only describe as a valued human, living the life I guess I expected to live before mental illness etc. 

Of course I still have bad days and terrible moments, we all do, I’m not perfect nor do I strive to be.

What I’m trying to say is things really will seem crap and life will feel aimless and futile, some days you will not want to move, you won’t want to speak to people, you won’t want to watch your favourite show - or play your favourite game. But I can say that in my opinion, these feelings do not last, I believe in you, just as that random stranger on the internet believed in me.

I’m not sure if this will help, but i hope it offers you some degree of comfort. Furthermore, my DMs are always open if you need to chat. 

Good luck you wondrous human! ",2020-04-18 11:56:48
550,fncdcr,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,12,The current situation has caused a HUGE setback,depression_help,"Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. 

A bit of background: I'm a California girl in my 50's. And, I've struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. I've got a claim for SSDI, but apparently I'm not sick enough. SMH   I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldn't breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight.

I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. I'm not ashamed to say I was Daddy's Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband.

So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. 

Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid-19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my mother-in-law for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed.
I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, I'll never go hungry. So since I'm disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is $50/month. I also had internet shut off because I couldn't pay them (just $50 too. My needs are small) I've had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities.

 And, well, I've run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didn't happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I don't know how to ask for help, or people just don't care. Let's add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. I've heard that the economic stimulus package won't pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because $1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a ""shelter in place"" order. I have asthma pretty badly, so I'm party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldn't go out. Same with my mother-in-law.

My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just ""be happy."" I've never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. 

So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. (I'm typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post) My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my mother-in-law's place so I could download some movies. It's really exasperating to be so helpless, and so tired of my f**ked up life, and so sad, and no real prospects in paying my measly $100/month bills. And when I reach out, it either goes sideways or I am ignored. I can't eat or I get very nauseous (die to my anxiety and a medical issue with my stomach.

Why don't I deserve the help I really need? I literally have nothing to live for. And I don't know what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/fncdcr/the_current_situation_has_caused_a_huge_setback/,69,I am sorry ur going thru this .. ,2020-03-23 02:32:12

552,c1d5po,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,6,Overthinking is killing me,depression_help,"I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some "" friends "" in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. That's when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldn't stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I can't even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didn't overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I don't know what to do. I've tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help.

&#x200B;

Thank you so much to everyone who responded to this. After seeing all of your comments I felt very relieved and not alone. I have been doing much better after typing this. So thank you again, knowing I am not alone helped me a lot. (:",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/c1d5po/overthinking_is_killing_me/,68,"Have you ever tried cognitive therapy? It helped me a great deal with this. This is rally an oversimplification, but one thing we did was to try to recognize the loop early on and SHOUT internally STOP! If it tried to creep back in, STOP!  I also learned to refocusing on another stimulus. There’s more to it than that, but that was the start of a change. It’s sort of just a guided behavior modification system.

Another thing that really helped was to shift my environment at the onset of anxiety or thought loops. I would physically get up and walk outside (didn’t want to!), but I did. I would walk hard and fast, get my breath rate up, deep breathing fresh air, looking at outdoor scenery just in my yard. 

Exercises like that can cause a shift and give you some control over your own emotions. I will say that as long as I allowed myself to stay isolated, I continually got worse until I forced myself to make changes. It was uncomfortable, but tolerable for very short periods of time. 

The more exercise I got and the more I talked with people, the better I felt. Even though I’m an introvert. I would focus my energy on someone else who needed help, or a few minutes of conversation with someone lonely.

I've been struggling with depression & anxiety since my freshman year of college (2015), culminating in a suicide attempt & an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. I can't afford counseling, and I can't get medication without a car. It's been a while since I've been on meds. Not sure I would be able to afford it if I could reach it. I was raised in a cult-like Christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college I was very isolated from modern culture, ""common"" sense, and a normal view of the world. Because of this, I have no idea how social programs work. I'm still scrambling to figure out how the normal world works. I tried applying to Modest Needs, was told I made too little to qualify, started looking at government programs, and got just absolutely completely lost.

Any suggestions for ways to make/earn/get money welcome as well, just keep in mind I don't have a lot of energy at the moment...

Has anyone who's had similar struggles in the past have any advice? Any resources? A suggestion for a place to start?

\-I was disowned & cut off by my family for religious reasons

\-I have some, small documentation of my mental illnesses, but because of those same mental illnesses, I can't make it to a doctor often, so the paper trail is inconsistent, spotty at best

\-I was in college 3 years, was in my senior year (I brought in credits) when I ran out of money and had to leave, never graduated

Im a 16 year old male who gets mediocre grades due to the fact he doesn't study. I have no gf as no one would care about my shitty face/body or childish personality.

My own family critizises me for not studying hard enough while I wake up every day feeling like shit.

Some time ago I tried to cheer myself up and started writing 5 reasons to live every day I woke up. I can't even write two of 'em.

No one knows about this as the first time I talked about it I felt worse for the reaction of my parents and how broken they were while in treatment than the actual depression. Even if I didn't get any better, everyday I would act a little better until the psychologist said I was ok, even if I was only acting (look, one thing I'm good at. Took me 16 years to realise).

This ks my second one and the only reason I wake up everyday without ending my life is because, the only thing I really care about was what would happen to my parents if I not only died, but killed myself.

If you have read this far, just want to thank you for taking your time to read through my sh*t.

Hope you get something more entertaining to do from now on ;).

The worst part: I play videogames all day because they are the only place I feel I can be myself without anyone complaining (my parents think telling me I'm useless will help get better and want to improve myself). And they now want to take them off me saying that I play way too much.

The only things I feel like doing are sleeping, being on my phone, and eating. Even then, nothing actually brings me pleasure or happiness. I can't even put effort into anything anymore because I become so distracted and everything feels so hopeless so I procrastinate so much. 

Just thinking about what to write on this post is hard but I really really want to vent so much but I just cant explain it all. In school my grades are suffering because I end up missing school a lot, either due to depression or panic attacks. 

All I wanna do in life is sleep and eat and use the internet, I used to have so many interests, for example, drawing and gaming. I would draw all the time and was really into improving my art, but these days it feels like such hard work even getting a piece of paper out. When i start up my favourite games, it's sometimes hard to even play one round (like in splatoon) because it feels so pointless and repetitive. 

Everything just feels like a chore to be honest. A lot of the time it feels painful, like emotionally painful, just to wake up, a mixed feeling of dread and sadness and fear and disappointment.

I know it sounds stupid but the pain and pressure caused by this (and other similar decisions) has become so overwhelming I can’t stand it. I won’t do it, but it almost feels like suicide is a better alternative than living life through painful decision after painful decision.

I don't know if anyone is going to read this or not, but if you do, thank you.

I haven't been on a date in two years, been intimate with someone in 3, I know that doesn't matter and it doesn't matter to me that much. But it feels nice to be attracted to in some way. Every single girl in the past two years has ghosted me. Every. Single. One. I tried paying for tinder, paying for match, paying for bumble, and clover. Tinder is kind of a joke but I'm just saying I tried them all. I went out and tried to meet people in bars, games, events. I've had a woman look me up and down and say ""ew"" and walk away after I tried to talk to her. I don't know, the biggest thing I want in life is a loving wife and beautiful children. And I may only be 22 but I want that long relationship where there is nothing but love, started at a young age. I don't want to be 50 finding my soulmate. But nowadays people see one thing they don't like about you and they just assume the relationship will never work.

I've lost several friends this year because of how things have changed. My friends also ended up trying to make plans without me and hide the fact they were hanging out, most of the time it was because they wanted to smoke, and I dont. And my work has me travel, often, and for at least a few weeks at a time several states away and I can't go out and spend time with friends or family, because I don't know anyone and there aren't any co-workers nearby because they usually send me to areas where they have no one. And it just amplifies the depression and started to develop insomnia because of my depression and having a hard time trying to fall asleep in a hotel room.

I also play softball, I'm halfway decent but I'm not good and it gets to a point where there are really good players on the team and I still end up sitting the bench, I even paid to be on the team and they didn't, I ended up paying to play this year but kind of have my heart set on quitting, it's gotten to be toxic to me because I expect more out of myself than what happens, and just like the world everyone focuses on what you did wrong, not the many good things you have done.

This quarantine has not helped me mentally and the constant ghosting, friends making plans without me, and softball. Thank you for listening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/fxf1xm/thank_you_for_reading/,65,"I'm sorry to say that but the problem is probably in your behaviour, not in you as a whole or whatever else low self-esteem might be telling, it's in little things you may not notice. Maybe you were judgemental about smoking and now your friends try to avoid it. For sure I don't know you, but usually people who are looking for a partner for life asap have it written on their face, and that's intimidating to others, because first months of dating are for getting to know each other and there's no place for commitment. It's totally fine to be 50 finding your soulmate, but it probably will happen much sooner. Far not everyone you meet have the same goals, and it's important to be understanding of that. Relationships are something built from scratch, something which grows and develops slowly as you grow and develop, both on your own and together with someone when you meet them. ",2020-04-08 21:15:01

585,e0655n,False,STORY,18,I lost my passion in music.,depression_help,"I’m 23, still didn’t finished my music degree and I feel like I don’t deserve to graduate from this course. I first studied AB English and told my dad that I can’t see my future with it. So, he allowed me to enroll a music degree. My major is Piano Concentration. I loved playing the piano since 7, though I wasn’t really good at it but I know how to play it. Since I got in a band in high school, that convinced my dad to take up Bachelor of Music. I started this course with [I think] 20% knowledge to Music Theory though I know how to read notes but not that fast. And I also started my First Proper Piano Lesson. I was doing great but my first piano teacher there keep on admiring advanced students instead of others like me and that made me miserable. I didn’t progress much.

By 3rd year, I had a new Piano Teacher and she was great. It made me go back to zero and that’s fine with me because I saw myself loving my passion again. I practice 6pm-9/10pm at school Mon-Sat. Until.... 1 night, a piano teacher came in my piano cubicle and told me that I am not allowed to practice there til 9/10pm because I AM NOT A ADVANCED STUDENT AND A RECITALIST. I told her that I need to practice in that kind of schedule because that’s the only time my body is productive to practice. So it’s like a body clock. On the other day, she reported me to the dean’s office and the dean told be that I shouldn’t be practicing on that schedule because it’s not in the rules. But I don’t remember that certain rule because I saw others practicing til 9pm so I thought it was okay. They still didn’t agree with me. After that discussion, I ran to the bathroom, cried so hard and called my dad about it. It was unfair. I was only doing it for myself because I want to be better. My dad bought me a 2nd hand electric piano so I can practice at my dorm. Everything went fine at first but I can’t get that incident out my head. It made me think that I’m a loser, talentless pianist there is in that school. That’s when I started to miss all my piano lessons and dropped my Piano Subject 3 times in a row.

It made me stayed in school since the 5th year. And I went to a psychiatrist to treat my traumas, my thoughts and insomnia. I was dianosed with depression with anxiety because of my thoughts of being afraid of what might happen next in the future. I’m terrified of tomorrows. That’s why I can’t sleep.

I moved to another piano teacher because I was so embarrassed to come back to my previous one. She already gave up on me because I wasn’t making any progress. And it’s a total humilliation to her reputation. I’m on my 7th year now and my current Piano Teacher is also great and he really wants me to graduate next year. He was patient of letting me going back to zero and gave me piano recital pieces that I can play. But my problem now is that, IT’S BACK. My demons are back and I haven’t returned to my psychiatrist since july. Because I’m afraid and my dad already used a lot of money for my mental health, sessions, medication and sleeping pills. I’m in a 3rd world country and we are not that rich.

I’m anxious that I might not graduate next year and it will make my parents misereble. I lost my passion in playing the piano that I can’t finish practicing 1 page in a day because of these thoughts and pain.

What do I do and where do I began to clear my head.,depression_help,"Here goes nothing , I found this app this morning and decided  why not. So here I am ... To begin I would say that the feelings that I have really buried deep away are starting to resurface. Outside of my thoughts during the day, cooking, cleaning, being a COOL MOM (smile) seriously I'm cool , collected and pretty much put together. I pretend ( can I say that) that I'm ok- cliche but I'm fucked up.My head goes bonkers with all type of cruel, belittling things and boy can we really get into ourselves. Everyday my children are growing, learning and watching my every single move, how can I let them see despair, hurt, anguish and such disgust within myself. Ever had to hide these kinda emotions from family and friends bc the chain of command begins with you so to say. Over the years yes years I have let myself rebuild, construct and motivate ppl watching them flourish happily I want the ones at my table to eat (understand) while my OWN life has taken a complete sad standstill. There's no fault here to noone nor am I searching for pity. My chest was heavy and I couldn't get to my pillow (🙃) This pandemic has taken it's very own toll on people outside of death in many different ways (sorry if any families has lost a loved one or may have suffered due to the virus hang in there!)  
Unfortunately I lost my job in Jan.2019 after 5 marvelous years due to my dad passing my Freaking Father 💔(very inconsiderate and inhumane) but I had no control over that. This is when I leaned HEAVY on my faith. I pray hard everyday and continue to without a doubt keep good faith never accepting a handout and remaining humble.I cried when the tears formed and screamed into pillows when the kids slept.... I'm beginning to lose a little of me everyday feels like. I can't!!! I have family, friends and by GOD I swear the best support hands down. Simply I don't want to make my burden a load on others. I pray for steady employment again just can't understand why is it so damn hard!! Like Oh man.. 
It hurts to want more and can't grasp it especially when you put super effort, remain positive, seek advice,look for guidance and keep my prayers consistent with my behavior.
 I must figure this out sooner than later. Just don't know how. Don't know how this app came about seriously but I'm almost sure it was just what I needed.Thanks for being here.

I knew right off the bat this wasn’t going to be a good switch for me, motivation and focus-wise. In the beginning, I actually adjusted pretty well. However, now that it’s down to the wire (two weeks left of class), I feel overwhelmed and hopeless.

The only big assignments I have left are three essays, two final exams, and a final project. I also have a few regular assignments to finish before all these are due. I’m attempting to work on one of the essays that’s due this Friday, but it feels hopeless. I feel like it’s going to be an awful essay, that I might as well not turn it in, and that it’s impossible for me to finish all these assignments over the next 2-3 weeks. 

My university is providing the option to take an ‘S’ grade for classes, so if I get above a D-, the class doesn’t affect my GPA at all. Part of me wants to take an ‘S’ for all my classes and simply give up on the rest of the assignments. However, I know the guilt will eat me alive if I do this. Plus, I can’t guarantee I’ll get above a D- in every class if I decide to take this route.

Is anyone experiencing something similar, or has in the past? Do you have any advice for dealing with this debilitating lack of motivation?

Was struggling to stay motivated before the switch to online classes, but now that I'm back home and everything's online I've been having a hard time even acknowledging my classwork, let alone finding enough motivation to do well on all my assignments.

Just focus on that goal, that's what I've been reminding myself of whenever I feel like ignoring an assignment or just giving up because nobody will notice. ",2020-04-21 19:23:24

That I feel the same time to time and I am sure a lot of people are feeling bad for being at home all day.

I know it sounds so naive and all but one of the things that helped me was talking about how you feel to people either publicly or anonymously.

592,ev3put,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,26,My breakup is killing me,depression_help,"Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. I'll try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs I'd love to because I'm just so incredibly lonely right now.

About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didn't want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were mean-spirited messages saying how she doesn't miss me, she's realized we're incompatible and that she's glad I moved out.

Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought it'd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder date, and it killed me. That's when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I can't take the situation and that I still want her back. That's when I got her mean-spirited message.

I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I don't know what's fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that it's hard to call it fun either. Sports? I've gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose \~10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me (in fact, it's kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup). After that, I trained every day, thinking it'd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost \~1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I don't even want to train anymore.

In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating ""passive"" suicide, as in, it wouldn't be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldn't it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesn't have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I won't ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I won't ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that she's not interested in me anymore.

Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and it's killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think I'm actually going to try something. I'm not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist. Not to mention that usually you'll have to wait a few months until there's a vacant spot. Please help me",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ev3put/my_breakup_is_killing_me/,67,"You've let yourself be completely absorbed by the relationship.

Delete tinder and work on yourself. 

Listen to podcasts and YouTube videos about break up, jealousy, losing yourself  in a relationship. 

Train and work out. 

Look inside and reflect in your relationship without the rose colored glasses. You and her were responsible for making the relationship healthy. 

You won't find someone like her but you will find someone who is better suited to you.

Take this time to learn to communicate more effectively, learn to maintain hobbies, and find joy in life again. ",2020-01-28 10:09:52

It’s likely that out of a natural fear he doesn’t want to fully open up and so casually mentioning serious topics such as suicide are his way of trying to drop hints.

You’re doing great already, and this lack of transparency isn’t your fault or his. Ask him if he’s truly alright when he seems depressed, most likely he will deny it but that doesn’t mean it was useless. Trying to get him to open up will be hard, as he is likely hiding his feelings out of fear it will hurt you or make you worry, or even just appear to make him seem weak. But he shouldn’t worry about these things if you are willing to take them on, and in a relationship, opening up isn’t a weakness. ",2019-06-23 20:10:50

596,9yi5h5,False,None,4,Addicted to sadness,depression_help,"""Emotional pain can become an addiction.  A negative feeling, such as anger, worry, grief, fear, or depression, can become so habitual that you cannot live without it.  There are physical as well as mental reasons for emotional pain addiction.

When a person is continuously stressed by emotional pain, there are subtle changes in the body that create a dependency on stress-related chemistry. Changing habitual patterns of pain can be as difficult as giving up an addictive substance, such as nicotine, alcohol, or even heroin.  The emotional pain addict unconsciously seeks out situations that are sure to result in pain.  A history of prolonged, negative, stressful relationships is usually symptomatic of emotional pain addiction.  The feelings of love and pain are so frequently associated that they become one and the same.  Loving unavailable people and staying in intolerable relationships, for example, are signs that love and pain have become intertwined.  There are many such pain-linked feelings in the repertoire of pain addiction.  Understanding the physiological part of emotional pain addiction can make breaking these patterns easier.""

""Every emotion, either positive or negative, is a blend of chemicals (neurotransmitters and hormones) that our brain instantly produces in response to thoughts. This cocktail circulates throughout the body producing corresponding sensations that are felt at both the psychological and physical levels. The chemistry of emotion is very addictive, if repeated frequently over a long period of time -- just like the chemistry of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. This is most noticeable in the case of negative emotions, as they produce stress hormones that our body, in a twisted, self-destructive way, can easily start craving like a drug.""

&#x200B;

""The presence of negative, distorted thoughts and feelings about reality leads to sadness and hopelessness. Sad people see themselves as worthless and get carried away by these emotions, leading them to abandon their usual activities. So not only do they perceive themselves as worthless, but they also abandon the activities that could counter this value judgment, which validates their beliefs.

This is where the vicious cycle begins, as they swap their routines and fun activities for a negative mood, without realizing that these activities could help them improve their situation and prevent their bad mood from intensifying. This creates a dynamic in which inactivity breeds more inactivity.""

""When you live with depression for years, you can become dependent on the familiarity of the mood. The negative patterns of thought associated with depression can become like an unhealthy coping mechanism, much like drugs and alcohol are for addicts. The negative thoughts and moods associated with bouts of depression may start to feel like a false sense of security.

Whether this constitutes an addiction is debatable, but what is obvious is that it is unhealthy and dangerous to get comfortable or dependent on a depressive mood. It can mean that a person gets stuck in the negative thought patterns and finds it more and more difficult to change.""

""So while my attachment to melancholy may not be “bad,” it would be beneficial for me to push on those moments to discover what I might be avoiding, what to bring to therapy rather than what to soothe away with a Solange album. Barth suggested that “one of the ways one might gradually get to those feelings is to really try to put into words what the melancholy feels like — physically as well as emotionally (like even where it’s located in your body and what color it is!).”

Perhaps the healthy way to approach melancholy is with moderation, to give room to those other stronger feelings even when it means making room for pain.""

597,h7je4r,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,5,I want to be happy again.,depression_help,"  

Goal: Currently I am all timer sad and want to be happy. 

I am neither a good person nor a bad person. I am somewhere in the middle or maybe totally out of circle. I don't know. 

I feel like I am living three lives. One which I show to my Family, one to friends and ex-colleagues. I am jobless. And one my true self which I show to myself only. Of course any differences in personality from my true self I manage by pretending someone else in my other two lives. But as soon as I enter my room and after carefully slowly locking my door I throw away the mask I was wearing and then I can clearly see the differences in my voice, thoughts, body language and goals, if any. My body feels so relieved. Then I start getting back in my true zone where I forget the tasks and goals I had planned in my mind. And I start feeding myself the worthless shit on Internet. At that time, I am only looking for that temporary dopamine hits because nothing simpler was giving me any joy. I started losing myself in weed. I sometimes was stealing weed from my friends or roommates. After smoking for at least 3 years, a small joint was not that powerful anymore to bring down the curtains covering my real life problems. So, I jumped to eating. Now again, simpler food was not any joy. Junk is pretty much gonna hit the D-spot. Small meals mean less dopamine. Give me more and more. Don't worry, I'll puke the previous and eat again until I am so wasted by the effort of eating - throwing - eating- throwing and of course the taste of food. There are consequences too. Bloating, Gas, Always upset. But nothing can stop me from doing it again and again atleast from last 2 years nothing has stopped me. Then in search for more dopamine I look for porn. Again, simple means no joy. Fell into Hetero-BBC - Trans - Sissy. Now I don't imagine me having sex with girl instead I am that girl and big funk is fucking me. I started dreaming about dicks. Bought a vibrating dildo. But deep inside I still have that longing for intimate relationships with girl. I never had any. 

I am king of overthinking. I think of every consequence of my actions. Like where I keep dishes in kitchen. Opening and closing door. Even when I am walking down the road. Striking a lighter to light my joint. everything small you can imagine. This makes me mad and too conscious. I keep thinking of my childhood scenes where I lived with my parents and always wondering how time has passed. I was a kid back then and now I am an adult. I am so obsessed with age of people. How old is he or she? That actor? That sports person? and then I compare what I was doing when I was 16, 18, 23 etc. I am 26 right now.   
 I don't check my actions usually but when I check them, they are bad. I am using same pair of clothes for months. Using same toothbrush for years. I have rarely gave any gifts to any one. I am not so close with my parents. I am single child. I lived in rented place for 11 years before leaving for another city for college. My parents finally have their own house now. We live with parents in India till death.   
 I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes. I now realized that maybe I was less satisfied with myself. I always felt less because all my relatives and friends had there own houses and car. My parents had one two-wheeler and my parents used to fight with each other which used to make me very sad. When I used to watch other parents living happily, I used to think why I don't have that, why my parents are always fighting? This less feeling I still have with me. I still feel less.   
 I am lazy for sure. Now I am sitting idle from last 1 year. No job, no friends, no personal connection with any human being. I never tell my secrets to anyone. Living in a rented room. Financially fucked, Relationships fucked.   
 I feel like a failure. I failed to become a good son, friend, brother, grandson or colleague.   
 I have become more secretive from last 2 years. I eat secretly, want to live secretly (deleting my pictures from social media).   
 I sometimes think If my parents die then I would have no one to answer and then I can live this miserable life for long. I don't think about my future at all. I have not reached the suicide point yet but I think this is how you reach there eventually. I can't imagine myself having a simple life with family and kids and work. I get very anxious imagining that will I be able to do that for these many years. I blame myself for all this. I did not take action when it was needed.   


In the end, I just want to be happy. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/h7je4r/i_want_to_be_happy_again/,63,Same omg ,2020-06-12 11:59:42

It doesn't matter if you make the perfect choice. It doesn't matter if you choose a career and end up hating it 5 years from now. If you don't choose, you'll probably still end up in a career path you hate 5 years from now. So just make a choice. Any choice. The road is full of flattened squirrels who couldn't decide to go. You will not permanently fuck your life up, you can always do something else, but if you do not make a choice, life will choose for you. ",2020-03-21 15:09:52

Inside, I haven’t improved.",depression_help,"(I originally posted this in r/depression, but I’m under the impression that it’s full of folks who would rather seek gratification that they are not alone rather than support. Maybe I’m wrong, but I am looking for feedback and a little advice, if possible. I hope to see you in a place where there is no darkness.)

I really hate posting this. It’s narcissistic, but I must satisfy the gnawing hunger of loneliness. It’s shameful, but a small morsel would be a blessing. Please forgive me.

In summary, while I’m aware it could have been much worse, I’ve had a terrible childhood. I’ve had social anxiety, terrible social skills, and half of a family. I was the bullied and ostracized for the first half. My concept of a friend at the time were the same people who would lie, cheat, and steal from me. Hopes that things would be different in middle/high school/college became disappointment as the cycle repeated itself. There were brief moments where I got a taste of what real friends were like, genuine people without judgements. However, they were very brief, and I never really made any lasting relationships.

I got away from it all. I emigrated to a country far away. The first year was tough, and I thought history would repeat itself once again. However, things got better, and  I live a somewhat comfortable life (at least, relative to my past).

I should be happy and fine. Yet I still feel hollow and empty. Despite knowing some genuine friends, I still find it difficult to put my trust in others and open up. No one wants to be forced to listen to my sob story; they have their own problems to handle. Very often, my past memories come back to haunt and torment me. On the outside, I would describe myself as a tad quiet and lazy, but positive and helpful. Inside, lethargic would be the best word to describe it.

I am grateful for where I am now, and each moment is a blessing. At the same time, life is in auto-pilot, and nothing would be better than laying on the floor in a remote cabin in Alaska, away from everyone.

You are entitled to your opinion, and I’m not going to judge you, so I ask you not to judge me. I just want to know if there is anyone else out there who is in this kind of situation.

How about turning your focus on what you have: You are alive, decent health maybe, you have access to information (internet).. you fill the blanks. I am certain you will find other things as well.

Gratitude is important, because it focuses you on what you have, instead of what you don't.

Think about what you have, and what you don't and you really need. Make some lists. And this is how you get ideas.

Think about the problems you currently have, and see if others have them. If many people have a certain problem, see if you can solve it by developing a product or service, and see if people are willing to pay.

Ask for help. Visit associations, volunteer, meet new people.

There is a solution, but you are not looking in the right place if you are not seeing it. Break the pattern and do something different.

612,g7p1o4,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,17,I (18M) think my girlfriend (18F) is falling into a depression and I don't know what to do about it.,depression_help,"Ok first of all I think this needs some context. We both live in a country where males are given far more rights and freedoms than females, and her dad is a tyrannical controlling misogynist and he doesn't let her do anything (basically she's been in quarantine her entire life). This is the main source of her sadness and it's really affecting her mental state negatively. She rants to me about it a lot and I try my best to make her feel better but I'm running out of ideas. 

About a month ago we were planning a way to get out of here and build a new life in a foreign country but, unfortunately, the plan flopped. Even without the coronavirus, there's no way to get her out of here safely without her father's permission. So the only way to get out is for us to get married, because when that happens I'll be the one legally in control of her (yeah, it's fucked up, I know). 

My family said I can't get married until I get a bachelor's degree (got 4 years left). This happened about a week ago and that really fucked my girlfriend's mental state up. She was sad before but at least she had hope for the future, now she says she feels like there's no hope for her and that she's losing her youth. 

At first I thought she was just exaggerating, because she was frustrated that our plan flopped, and I told her it was gonna be alright and motivated her successfully (or so I thought) but it's been a whole week and she's still depressed. I don't know what to do since we can't really be together because of this lockdown and her piece of shit dad. I send her motivating texts and constantly remind her that she's a wonderful amazing person and that she makes me really happy, but that doesn't seem to have any long term effects. 

We were talking today before she went to sleep and she said she was feeling down again, but this time she didn't have a specific reason to feel this way. that's why I'm worried and I think this is a much deeper issue than I previously thought. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said ""thanks but I don't think it'll help"". I just sent back some sweet messages that got a positive reaction then we said goodnight. 

I hope that this is normal sadness and I'm just overthinking, but what can I do to make her feel better or to maybe stop the sadness altogether? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g7p1o4/i_18m_think_my_girlfriend_18f_is_falling_into_a/,64,"Before you do anything just talk to her and check the true extent of the problem. As I said, she might just be a bit sad at the moment. If you find that she is reluctant to talk and open up maybe share your thoughts and feelings. Maybe if you talk about how upset you are that you can’t elope, or how sad you are that you can’t see her more etc etc it will ease her mind and she will feel able to open up to you when she realises that she’s not the only one feeling the way she is. Or who knows, maybe she is down about something completely unrelated! Or doesn’t even realise she is behaving in a way that is making you this worried. 

Are your family aware of this situation? I’m sorry but from the way you’ve described this situation I’m going to say what I genuinely think based on my life experience.

Nb: No matter what; all I want is the best for both of you so please know that everything I’m going to say is to try and help even if it seems a bit harsh

1. Can she not go to University too? That would give her some independence, a chance to get out the house etc. 

2. Are your family really the type of people who would ignore your happiness to this extent?

3. If she really has depression - she needs help. Being admitted to a hospital or taking her to see a doctor would be the best thing here as well as reaching out to the community/government/legal routes to see if there are any options for her. 18 legally makes you an adult in most countries so if she is 18 and is, in the eyes of the law, an adult, her father has no power over her. Moreover, if you are 18 you are an adult and therefore your family have no power over you.

4. You say none of the options people have given are realistic because you need your family to pay for your education. I’m sorry to say this but is your education more important than your girlfriends life? - if it is something you absolutely know you want and you have looked into every single way of getting an education and there is no way to get one then that is your choice. I am not saying this to be mean or anything I’m just trying to look at this from various angles. I have known too many people who have tried to and have succeeded in killing themselves. If she is genuinely very depressed, you can’t take for granted the idea that she will survive and wait for you for 4 years. She might be too depressed and take her own life if she is forced to continue living the way she has. 

5. If you absolutely cannot get married and if you absolutely have to get your degree then I would talk very seriously and honestly with your family. Maybe they won’t let you get married but maybe they would be able to help in some other way that you both, at 18, aren’t able to think of or don’t know about. Also, if your parents are made aware of the full extent of your girlfriends mental state and the situation with her father, they may reevaluate the situation.

6. If you can’t do anything to help her until you have gotten your degree, maybe you shouldn’t necessarily break up with her, but maybe you should be aware that expecting her to wait might not be the fairest thing for you to expect from her. - with this point I want to say that you need to be very careful. I would imagine she is upset because she loves you very very much and you are probably the thing keeping her going right now, so please know that I am absolutely not telling you to end the relationship, I am just trying to share some opinions from various perspectives because I don’t know where you both live or any more than you’ve shared. 

I don’t believe ending the relationship would be the thing to do here. I believe getting her away from her dad and/or to a doctor is the key here, I am just kind of playing devils advocate. Someone had said “wait until you’ve got your degree” but expecting a young woman to remain depressed and imprisoned for 4 years while you are off getting your education isn’t very fair and it would likely lead to a bad end. This is why I believe getting her into uni or work would be good to help her get her independence and maybe even save money, talking it over with your family to see if there is anything they are able to do or change considering your girlfriends situation and getting her to a doctor are the main avenues to go down.

Do try talking to her again before doing anything else though. She may just be a little upset. Depression can last a week or for someone’s entire life. She might just be a bit low because of the state of the world. Does she have much social interaction via the internet and friends etc? 

It’s clear how much you care about her and it’s really touching to see that you are her trying to get advice from others. As I’ve said, I know some of what I have said might seem a bit dramatic but with mental health you never know so I would rather say things to make you consider them than not say anything and for something bad to happen.

Last quick thing: you might have to choose between her and your education so maybe think about what you truly want - you’re 18 and you deserve everything you want in life but sometimes we do have to make difficult decisions.

Finally: I know you love her, but it is not your job to “fix her”. She is responsible for looking after herself too. It’s great that you are trying to help but don’t forget that you are not responsible for her life. There is only so much you can do, and you do need to think about yourself too. ",2020-04-25 06:44:33

Is there an emergency-type of meds I can take to make the zaps lessen? I’m on Pristique so being off it so suddenly is also causing havoc on my gastrointestinal system as well.

Edit: thank you all for the advice. I called my doctor and she said, as some of you suggested, to call the pharmacy and ask for an emergency supply. I asked her what to do if they refused and she said call us in the morning. Which I was planning on doing originally anyway. By the time I called the pharmacy, however, it was already closed.

I know some people never know their real family, and I know life would've been so much worse without them, but damn, the ""tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"" saying just doesn't feel right anymore. 

I wish that if my biological dad, mom, step dad, and brother would all be dead by the time I turned 25, that I had never gotten to know and love them and rely on them. 

Every paternal figure in my life has died. After my step dad killed himself, his best friend took over as my ""Uncle"". Within 3 years, he had a massive heart attack and passed away. After several similar occurences I've gotten superstitious about father figures. 

I have a full-time job, a fiancee, and pets. I want to be happy and hopeful so badly for them, but I just get so stuck and depressed. I feel like they should be enough for me, and I'm a burden by being depressed. 

I've lost so many friends over the years (it happens to high school and college I know) that it doesn't feel normal, and feels like my depression is driving them away. 

If I hadn't inherited a nightmare I might be ok, but my mom left me several cars (and an RV) that are all in disrepair and not smogged or registered. I look at them every day and cry, but I feel powerless to get out of here. 

I think there might be equity in the house, but I'm terrified of all the issues a home inspector might find when we go to sell. 

I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do. I want to seek therapy, but I'm already paying a mortgage that's $1,000 more than I can afford every month. I'm drowning in debt. I need to get rid of those cars, but every time I try, something happens and I can't get it done, then I get discouraged and don't try anymore. It makes sense that if I'm wasting a ton of money just on my depression and not getting things in order that therapy is a worthwhile investment, but I haven't had good experiences with therapy in the past. I also know that if they look at my income it looks like I'm making plenty of money, so I don't think sliding scale would help. 

I don't want to die, but living takes way too much effort. That scares me, because I've heard that described as ""Passive suicidal ideology"" or something. I'm just so tired. I have no desire to do anything because I know spending money will make me have to work on selling the house even sooner. 

I don't know if I can ask the mortgage company to lower my payment while I work on selling, or what since the loan is in a trust. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I've written this all in a journal a million times. I just needed to share this with someone, and this community seemed appropriate? I'm sure I'll get plenty of ""Go to therapy"" comments.

 I feel so guilty sharing my feelings. Everyone just says ""Oh, it's so unfair what happened to you"" and I know. I wish I could stop feeling sorry for myself even though I really don't have it THAT bad in the grand scheme of things. 

I just want to feel actual happiness again, and be able to not bring everyone around me down. 

Again, I'm not going to hurt myself(I truly don't think so). I haven't felt truly suicidal since middle school/one episode when I was 19/20 after my longtime girlfriend cheated on me and left me. I only attempted once when I was young. 

I know that I'm capable of getting through this, I am just in constant emotional agony currently. I generally consider myself to be logical and of a moderate intelligence, but I feel so stupid and irrational. 

If you took the time to read this I appreciate you. 

Here's to feeling better. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eo8ob8/life_just_feels_over_and_im_only_in_my_mid_20s/,65,"Maybe you can think of things in a different way: obviously everything that happened is a tragedy, but those things are in the past. The silver lining is you went through a series of experiences that few other people go through until they are in old age. 

This will make you more mature. It will make you more empathetic. It may even make you more passionate, if you start using the bad experiences to motivate yourself.

Dwelling and ranting really doesn’t help. Thinking negatively doesn’t help. You have to try to switch your thinking or you will of course feel negative after constantly thinking negative thoughts and doing little to try to end the negative thoughts themselves. Not saying that’s easy, or sufficient to cure everything; but if you don’t even try to be positive and keep ranting and dwelling on everything that is bad - you have no chance of being happy. The first step is changing your outlook and way of thinking. If you feel overwhelmed by your thoughts and feel like you can’t change your way of thinking, try meditation lessons.

A phrase I always found helpful is “just stay on the bull.” Life can seem hectic and overwhelming at times / often, like you’re riding a bull. You can feel overwhelmed by reality and too stressed to think straight. But the key, as cliche as it sounds, is to hang in there. Keep fighting the day to day struggle and doing your best. You don’t need to fix everything now, you just need to stay in the game enough so your future self has a chance to succeed. 

Compliment yourself for the effort you’re making and the progress you’re making. Try to do healthy things like exercise and sleep to help manage your stress. Keep building and eventually things will likely get better. There’s no guarantees, bad luck happens, but you sound like you’ve already received your fair share of bad luck and you should be optimistic that life can really only go up from where you are now. You’ve been through a very disproportionate amount of tragedies for someone your age - it’s logical to think that the years to come will be better than the past.

Take it slow. Breathe. Do things at your pace. The debt probably isn’t as much as you’re imagining, and a few days of setbacks isn’t going to ruin your life. Get around to selling those cars, but if you don’t feel up to it, take a break. Just try to make small steps when you can. Over time it will get easier and easier. The hardest part is always the first few steps of a journey.

620,dlv4su,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,8,Feeling Lost and Weak,depression_help,"Hi there, um, I don’t really know how else to start this, so I’m just gonna go, okay? okay.

I’ve struggled with severe anxiety and depression for basically my whole life. Or maybe not my whole life, it’s hard to remember, but definitely after my mother died. Car accident. Nasty business. I was 12, I saw it happen. I think I’ve been broken ever since then.

It got worse and worse and worse over the course of a decade. I went from honors student, “”gifted””, to dropping out of college. My brain felt like it was clogged up with glue. But I told myself it was all my own fault, that I was just lazy, selfish, immature. Making excuses.

I’ve seen some doctors, therapists too, most of them were incredibly unhelpful. The stress of dealing with the medical system outweighed any help I got from them. Any medications they tried to make me feel better were duds at best.

I went through a really, REALLY bad period about 3-4 years ago. I lost my entire group of friends, and let myself be abused by my partner for far longer than I should. I turned to self-harm, it was the lowest point I’d been in my life. I still see the scars when I look in the mirror.

But then I started to get better! I got new friends, got a job, allowed myself to be proud for once. I stopped self harming, swore never to again. Even after getting sexually harassed by my (thankfully ex) boss, even after losing my grandfather to cancer, I kept it together...for about a year and a half.

Almost exactly one year ago I got hit by a car as I was crossing the street. Physically I was mostly unharmed, but it brought back all those memories from the accident where I lost my mother. I started becoming irritable, lethargic, occasionally manic, and the panic attacks...at one point I was having full panic attacks ever single day.

I knew I needed help, but I felt powerless to get it. I had to leave my old clinic because the stopped taking my insurance. I wanted to switch to insurance through work but I’d already missed the cutoff date. I wouldn’t be able to apply for another year....

I almost made it. But I was unspooling too fast. I ended up leaving that job before I could get the help I needed. But that was fine, I had enough savings to get me through a month or two, I could find a new job.

That was, I don’t even know, three months ago? I haven’t even applied. I just...can’t find the energy. I know I need help, I know I’m really sick, but I just...can’t move. I’ve had the website for a local therapist open in my tabs the whole time (one that I can email, because holy hell phonecalls are an anxiety nightmare even when I’m feeling sane) but everytime I go to reach out I just get paralyzed by anxiety and uncertainty, and I just can’t find the will to muster through it. I haven’t gone back to self-harming but I’m so afraid of ending up back in that place again, it’s been a struggle. I just don’t know what else to do. I just don’t know what I CAN do?! I’ve been exhausted all day but I can’t even sleep. And I feel like I’m crying but my face is utterly still

Fuck I’m sorry this wasn’t supposed to be nearly this long. If you read all that, thanks, sincerely.

622,bacugo,False,Add a Flair!,31,I imagine my suicide almost daily,depression_help,"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to start. But the fact I am here now writing this is proof to myself that something is wrong with me. I'm not sure if I should begin with my childhood and work up to now or if I should just flat out say what's bothering me right now. But more or less, I think about killing myself; at least once, every day. When I wake up first thing in the morning I feel a gaint rush of anxiery and dread over the fact that once again, I did not die in my sleep and I have to somehow live today. Every night before bed sometimes I imagine my eventual suicide and I smile because I know that's probablly going to be one of the 'happiest' moments of my life. I get so nervous thinking about killing myself though even though the concept beings me peace, because I was raised unity christian growing up so I am worried I will go to hell if I do commit suicide. I also fear being stuck in 'purgatory' if I do commit suicide (which is almost just as bad as hell) if not considered actual 'hell' in some religions. I stay up at night fearing going to sleep sometimes as well because I have such vivid and intense dreams. I even dream about attempting suicide in my dreams and when I have those types of dreams I usually wake up and immediantly run to the bathroom to go vomit. What else can I say? I have Ptsd from surviving an armed robbery at my work and I have survivor's guilt because I feel bad for surviving it and not being able to just go back to my ordinary life now.  (Instead now I have ptsd and I fear even going outside to the groceey store. ) I feel guilty because the other girl that survived the robbery is fine and seems to be living her life and traveling and is unafraid (where as I have trouble even going outside period after what happened to me.) I feel like if I couldn't just bounce back and act 'normal' like her, that perhaps those guys should have killed me that night when they were pointing the gun at me to rob my place of work. So I have survivor's guilt but I also hate myself. I really hate who I am. I hate my looks. My voice. My choices in life. Everything basically. I am a 22 year old female and I have thinning ultra fine brown hair that's not very thick at all and I am so self concious about my hairline and lack of thick hair that I don't even want to go out in public or even be seen because I feel so disgusting and ugly that I have had random teenagers point at me in public and make gagging noises over my appearance. I know I am not always ugly because I have actually modeled in the past. The thing was I used hair extensions and make up to hide my discolored anorexic looking skin and acne, and to make my hair look as beautiful on the outside as I felt on the inside.  Then my hair started thinning out so bad that I couldnt wear hair extensions anymore and I am at the point where I should probablly wear a wig but the ones with realistic hairlines cost like $500 and I don't have that right now. My hair is also right now dyed this ugly ass copper penny color (auborn brown color faded) and my brown roots are large and they blend into the copper tones like an ombre but i know my hair is ugly. I went to cosmetology school but even I can't figure out how to fix my hair or make up. I thought I was alright at make up for a while and then I went back and really looked at my photos and that's when I started even hating my face with make up on.  I have gotten to the point where I hardly even wear make up because I know it doesn't look good on me. I just have an ugly face. My acne is bad and the make up doesn't hide it completely.  I feel like whenever I wear make up I just look even more ugly. Like the make up is enhancing all my insecurities. I have stretched ears too and I know people think that shit is gross so I am self concious about the fact that people probablly take one look at me and judge me to be homeless based on my outfits/lack of nice hair and make up and name brands. So on top of my ptsd and depression and anxiety, I am pretty sure I have some body dymorphia thoughts affecting me and how I see myself. I actually don't like to look in the mirror for too long because I actually get depressed seeing how ugly I am. I just imagine myself to look better than I actually do so when I see myself and my true ugliness, I get dissapointed and I hate myself for even trying to pretend to be pretty. That's another thing that I suffer from: Imposter syndrome. I suffer from feeling like a fraud or imposter most days. When I worked at different jobs like chipotle, and target, I still felt like any moment they were going to find out I wasn't really as great as they thought I was and they were going to fire me. I always fear people finding out that I have anxiety and then getting rid of me because of it. I try my best to hide it, but my ptsd is so bad that I have had to quit jobs due to my anxiety over being fired for attendence or something. I worry a lot. I compare myself to everyone else in the world and I think I am an imposter that is not as good as other people even at the things I love to the point where I don't even want to do the things I love anymore because I think I suck and that anyone can do it, probablly better than me. I used to have so many dreams and hobbies and now I just think I suck at everything to the point where I just don't want to exist because I don't think the world has any room for me. I feel like I don't deserve to live here on earth because I am such a loser. I feel like it is already too late for me and I will never amount to anything. I fear I will spend all of my life or the rest of my life in a mental hospital if I ever tell anyone these thoughts and feelings that I have so I try to keep it to myself but it's slowly eating me alive. I wish I could die. I don't want to be here anymore because I don't think I was ever meant to be here. I think some days that I was meant to kill myself. I feel like I am just another human taking up space and contributing to global warming. I just over all don't see any value to my life at all. I've let my depression and ptsd take over to the point where I don't sing anymore, write lyrics or draw or do anything I once dreamed of doing. I've deleted my social medias for the most part so I have nothing to do all day. I smoke weed and watch anime and that's how I have been spending my days but this isn't how I want to live my life and I know that but each dat that passes where I don't accomplish my dreams further puts me into a pit of dispair where I feel like committing suicide because it is too late for me to live my dreams. I worry I am too mentally ill now from what I have been through to ever actually accomplish my dreams and that concept alone makes me want to kill myself because I can already imagine myself being 80 years old and still watching anime and having no life and feeling the way I do now, and if that's what my future has in store for me, then I might as well just end my life right now. I don't have really any friends and I am too scared to go out and make them because I don't think anyone would ever want to be friends with me anyways because I am so nerdy and weird. I don't even know how to communicate anymore. When I go out to the store to get a sandwhich, I try to make small talk but I don't even want to do that. I don't like social interaction anymore even though I crave it sometimes from all the social isolation I have put myself through. When I say I don't know how so socualize anymore I really mean it. I go outside and idk wheather to make eye contact with people or weather to look down or if I should smile or not when I pass by people or if they think I am some homeless drug addict for doing that. I get so mentally stuck on what other people could be thinking of me that it makes it hard for me to talk to people in real time and keep up with their conversation or even know what to say to them and I worry that my face and eyes are giving away how scared I am to even be socializing and I worry it makes me vulnerable and an easy target. Okay, now, let me add that I grew up in an abusive home enviorment with a narcissistic dad and narcisstic mom. They were verbally,  physically, emotionally and sexually abusive to me growing up and even now they are still abusive so when I see them on holidays it is very hard on me because they say such hurtful things to me. I think that's why I care so much about what other people think, because my own parents told me I deserved to be sexually abused because of what I looked like. I had rainbow hair from age 17-21 and a septum ring and my own parents said that that made me look ""mentally ill"" and ""easy to take advantage of"" and a bunch of other hurtful things. To be honest the rainbow hair was the only choice I ever made for myself that I actually felt was mine and it made me happy. I also did it vwry beautifully because I went to cosmetology school so it was really beautiful. I'm sad my hair is too thin to allow me to dye it anymore but I used to feel good about myself when I looked that way even though my parents hated it. Looking back now, I still think I look ugly in a lot of different ways. Now, I must also add that I have an eating disorder. I currently weigh 132 or so but I'm a size small in everything. I used to throw up every day multiple times a day and I weighed 94 lbs. That's when I got a medical marijuana card and that helped me eat food again and stuff. My eating disorder is anxiety related so it doesn't have anything to do with body image. I just feel so stressed all the time that it's hard for me to eat anything because I am afraid it will make me feel sick and I will throw up so I am pretty thin because I hardly eat and I am very self concious about my eating disorder problems and the health problems that come with it. I am now also self concious about my teeth because from all the vommitting my gums have been receding and I am afraid to even show my mouth smiling because I am so self concious that my mouth looks like a drug addicts mouth or something. I do smoke weed but I didn't think weed could cause gum problems or teeth problems. I'm afraid to go to a dentist and find out how bad my mouth is. I know I need to go, but it's just one more thing to add to my endless list of things that are now stressing me out. I am sorry to ramble on and to make this post so long but since I haven't been established with a therapist yet, I have no where else to vent this and no one to say this to. I have to let it out somehow; so here were are. Anyways, after saying all this and seeing that this is my life, I feel like killing myself because I hate what a pathetic loser I am. I hate that I am not making music like I want to and instead I allow my mind to put me down so much that I consider committing suicide almost daily. I wish I could ""just get better"" so I can live my life again and make music and have my dreams happen. But I worry a lot that maybe my dreams were never meant to happen because I was born disadvantaged mentally (with anxiety and depression and phobias) I'm worried that because my mom and dad made me, I have their problems genetically passed to me and because of that, I am worried that some of my anxiety was passed down to me so any idea that I had growing up of me ever being a singer or an artist one day was foolish because I was born with the predisposition for anxiety so I was never meant to fulfil my dreams and me even dreaming them was stupid to begin with because people who are mentally ill like me can never accomplish anything/or it's extremely hard for them to accomplish things because their own mind is their number one enemy. That's basically what I worry/think/feel all the time and that actualization alone makes me want to kill myself the most because I feel abolsutely foolish and worthless. Worthless from birth and foolish for ever thinking I could ever be otherwise. This feeling...all these feelings are hell on earth for me and I can't take it anymore. I have created a hell on earth for myself within my own mind and it is horrible. My own thoughts on myself are so self sabotoghing that I can't do anything anymore. I've lost interest in everything. All my dreams. All my goals. Even hope of me feeling happy on my next birthday is dwindling. I don't even feel happy when I eat food, I feel depressed. I don't want to go inside a mental hospital because I know it will make me feel more sad and I won't eat the food there. I'll only eat the strawberries if they give them to me because I just don't like food. I know all this is affecting my health. I just don't know what to do about it. I already saw my doctor recently and she gave me a refferal for therapy and I am currently on a waiting list but my anxiety is so bad I haven't even called back to see if they can get me into an appointment. This is my life. It's shit. And I know I shouldn't be complaining because some people out there have it way worse than me so I feel like I don't deserve to have this platform to even tell people how I feel. I feel like I should just suck it up and move on but I can't.  I really want to just end my life already and stop taking up other people's time. If I've gone 22 years feeling this terrible I don't think I can survive anymore. I want to end my life but I am scared of going to hell if I do so. I'm not worried about hurting people by ending my own life. You can't convince me anyone (including my own family) would even miss me or really feel much pain past the initial shock of hearing my death but secretly everyone in my  family would be happy to see me dead because I don't think they like me anyways. I haven't talked to any of them in months,  some of them years, and I haven't seen friends either. I've been trying to make myself dissapear and fade into the background of people's lives for a while now. I used to be an instagram model until one day I realized everything about my life was shallow, empty, and meaningless and that's when I decided to just delete my instagram and fb...and myself. I don't think anyone hardly noticed my disappearing on social media because I had only 2 messages from people asking about it and those people don't talk to me very regularly anyways. I didn't have many followers on my instagram so I don't think anyone missed me much. I made this reddit over a year ago to post a story about how I almost was abducted into sex trafficking but it was too hard on me with my ptsd to re live what happened by telling the story again so I haven't finished my first post ever on the subject due to that. Anyways, I don't expect anyone to read this post or even see it. I don't think anyone will respond either because I don't think my life is that valuable compared to other people. I bet there are people out there that will see this post as proof there is a mental health crisis in america and that I should just end my life already if I am already in this much pain. I guess what stops me from killing myself is the fear of 1. Going to hell and 2. Possibly regretting it because I could have changed my life and got better somehow and braved the storm. :/ those ideas hold me back but it doesn't stop me from wanting to end my life when I am faced with any minor setback. I hate that aspect about me. I wish I wasn't like that. Anyways, I am sorry for making this so long. I wish this wasn't my life and that I did not feel this way but unfortunately, this is how I feel and I have to let it out somehow. I hope life can get better me. I hope I don't have to kill myself. I hope I can feel 'happy' again for a long time and have it be genuinley real. I hope I can get past this stuff and make my dreams come true but as each year passes I lose more and more hope that things could ever be better each time. I do not know how much longer I can take of doing nothing with my life. I'm sorry this post couldn't be happier. I'm sorry I exist. I'm sorry I exist at all. I'm sorry for complaining online and for doing nothing in real life to feel better other than crying. I'm sorry I am so weak and pathetic. I wish I could be stronger. I wish I didn't feel this way.

But he told me that this is a disease like diabetes, not all people have the same type of diabetes, and the treatment is not the same to everyone. 

Lack of will power and extreme guilt are symptoms of depression, and there is nothing I can do.... except the treatment. 

As long as I'm treating myself, I'm doing the best I can. 

I moved to another country so I'm 1 year without therapy, and I just changed meds when I was visiting my family  during the holidays, I should have gone to a psychiatric here last month to check, but I didn't. 

He up the dosis of my meds and will suggest me a therapist.

I treat my depression for 7 years, I heard that all before, but when everyone is saying the same thing over and over again it's easy to forget.

If you have depression and are not being treated, you really should. 
That friend that said that had depression after the break up and ""cured"" themselves, so you also don't need a treatment? wasn't depressed, just sad. 
If you don't have money, you can find free help in universities or institutions, it may be far and a bit inconvenient, but is so worth it.

It takes a while for you to find the right medication, but when you find it, the world changes. For real. 
and therapy is so important, I don't know how I survived 1 year without it. 


Fun fact: when he asked me who told me those things about how I should try harder and that are people out there who has depression and still work and go to school, I said that nobody told me that.

I don't know why I lied.

Ok, not that fun. 

I just want to encourage anyone here who is avoiding treatment. You should try it, please. 
It really does help.

A lot of hospitals will take small hats for the preemies. If you start out with something easy (like a scarf) and work your way to more challenging pieces it makes a difference.

I can’t say what will work for you but for me going outside for nature walks really helped to begin breaking this cycle.

641,dsaows,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,27,I'm at a loss (NSFW),depression_help,"I guess I'll start from the beginning.
I know I don't have it anywhere as hard as anyone else, but I guess I'm extremely weak.

When I was young, my mom and dad had shared custody. My mom had me only as a way to try and trap my dad. (It didn't work, he didn't even want kids and didn't have any interest in marrying her regardless)
When I was at her apartment, I would see drug use, a lot. Of course I didn't understand what it was at the time but as I've grown older I know what was going on. She had a boyfriend named Michael. He molested me periodically from the age of 4-6 (with her knowledge, she fucking watched). Everything from before that point in my life is a gigantic haze. My dad knew something was going on, but I didn't tell him. (I couldn't, at the time Michael had said he would hurt my mom and dad, and I didn't want anything to happen to either of them) 

I guess he decided enough was enough and gained full custody of me. Shelled out the thousands of dollars he had to, to gain full custody of me. At that point I had a lot of emotional confusion, and feelings I guess?  I started getting in trouble in school, and had to be moved to species education in third grade for being hyper aggressive. I began counseling for my anger and for years didn't understand the point of talking about my problems. Why talk about it, if I couldn't be helped I guess. I continually got in trouble in school, and by 5th grade I had been charged with simple battery. I would continue to get in trouble and be charged throughout school, would spend time in YDC. At the age of 13, when I was being questioned buy the SRO when I was in handcuffs I finally caved and talked vaguely about my molestation. I had been trying to suppress those memories and when I first talked about it everything rushed back. The feelings and all. A fucking floodgate had been opened and I didn't know what the hell it was. 

A month or so later, I had taken all of my medication and tried to end my life. I guess that was the first time I fully had and understanding of wanting to die. I had to have my stomach pumped and went to a psychiatric facility for 24 hours after I had been sent there from the hospital. I wasn't up front, I was so disgusted and intimidated by being there that I told them I did it for attention and they let me go. Mind you, I talked my fucking way out of that place in 24 hours after ingesting all of my medication.

At my hearing for another battery charge a couple months later, I was ordered by the state to have a psychological evaluation or I would become a ward to the state. So I caved and went through every detail of my molestation over the course of six hours. I felt so disgusted with myself, I wanted to die even more than when I had taken all of my medications. I went into the ""why me?"" phase. I was mad at the world, mad at God and to this day I still am.

The psychologist had diagnosed me with PTSD, depression, anxiety, separation anxiety, insomnia, and auditory schizophrenia. The fucking rollercoaster just kept worsening because I had finally talked. Why? There was no benefit, talking was pointless. So they began intensive therapy and trying different medications. At that point, I was back in school and fighting more, because SOMEHOW kids had found out. Being called a fucking retard is one thing, but people ridiculing me for what had happened made me angrier. 

That's when I fully understood what schizophrenia was. Only one person had said anything about my early childhood, however it was almost like it was the whole class, I had gotten into a fight and was arrested. When sitting in a holding cell, waiting for my dad to pick me up I genuinely realized that the voices were in my head. I decided that I didn't want to hear anything and began slamming my head against the wall and had knocked myself out and given myself a concussion. When I had came to and was going to the hospital; I fully understood what was wrong.

It took a couple of years, and at the age of 15 I was starting to mellow out. Then, I realized that I only had one testicle. My grandmother had taken me to the doctor and it appeared that my left testicle never descended. I had surgery and had to have it removed. The doctor ended up telling my dad that it was blocked by scarring of some sort. Which i don't understand unless it came from my molestation.

I came to from my anaesthesia, and they asked how I felt. I only asked about my teste as dumb as it sounds. When they told me they had to remove it I sobbed my ass off, and they gave me some strong medication for sleep. This is when I understood how selfish my father could be. 

Because of my emotional stability they wanted me to rest so I could be monitored, my dad told me ""you can't go to sleep, we don't want to get caught in traffic."" Traffic, traffic of all fucking things. So I fought through whatever they had given me and they decided to send me home.

Fast forward to 16, I had woken up a morning before school and had it in my head that I wanted to die. So before I got on the bus, I had eaten all of my adderall, the hydrocodone I had saved from my surgery, my respirdal, lamictal, abilify, and whatever else I was on and went to school. I figured it would have killed me before I had actually got to school. I got to school and staggered off, and fell down. They helped me in the school and could tell something was wrong and called my grandmother. The nurse told her to check to see if I had taken something as I was showing signs of overdosing. Everything is a haze, but apparently they made me vomit and no medication they could tell came up. So I went to the hospital and they pumped my stomach. Everything for the next few days is a haze and I went to a psychiatric facility for a week. That's all my insurance would let me do, I decided I wanted help, only for my insurance to limit it. Whatever, I got out and they altered my medication. They had managed to get the voices for the most part to stop, but I was dealing with everything else the best way possible.

At the age of 17, I graduated a year early and my insurance lapsed as I was no longer in school. I had to use what I learn to keep everything from worsening. I haven't done anything since, I'm 22 and have been unmedicated the entire time. Now, and i don't know why now but everything has substantially gotten worse in the last 3 days. I can't afford help, I don't have insurance and I'm so fucking close to blowing my brains out. I don't know what to do, I can't figure out what i can do and I'm just alone.

If anyone can give me an idea of what I can do for immediate help, I'm in Georgia. Everything I've looked at tells me to go to the hospital, but I can't. If I go, I'll lose my job, my apartment, my truck. Everything, I need help but now that I want it I can't fucking get it..",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dsaows/im_at_a_loss_nsfw/,59,Cool ,2019-11-06 03:44:55

I know it can be hard hard to think of ways in which your life is good when the dark curtain of depression is over your eyes, so you could try delving into that darkness and imagining how things could be worse and simply be thankful for the fact that things aren't like that. You can set a really low bar for things to be grateful for, like the fact that soap exists and we don't have to stink all the time, or the fact that toilets exist and we don't have to just shit on the floor or whatever. If you get in the habit of thinking about things your grateful for, even for just one part of your day, it'll start affecting your overall way of thinking. Life is hard, but we aren't built for sitting around eating peeled grapes or whatever, we're here to contend with the structure of reality and make the most of it. Life's an adventure. Imagine that your life is a book, the pain and suffering make that book more interesting. No one wants to read a book where everything goes perfectly all the time and nothing unexpected ever happens or goes wrong, that's a boring ass book. Don't let something as insignificant as a test make you feel like life is worthless. Your life isn't defined by some shit written on a piece of paper man, you're good.

I’ve stopped having suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now and I thought I would be able to recover without having any help or any therapy sessions at all. But just last night, I had trouble breathing again and this time no-one was around. I was all alone in my room with my aunt downstairs and my dog beside me trying her best to do what she can to calm me down (cause I think deep down my dog senses that something’s not right w/ me). I’ve had scenarios like these before. The first time, and I remember it so DISTINCTLY was when I sang up on stage alongside my choirmates and I was the soloist at the beginning of the piece and I forgot the first note, so I sang the whole piece a note lower so it affected my choirmates and they got confused and they couldn’t sing along and it was embarrassing. But the worst part was when a male teacher went to me, scolded me, and said “How could you be so selfish?” “You messed up big time” and he just made me feel like shit. He gave us this look that he would give to people who were worthless to him and I approached him and he gave me that look, but I disregarded it and said “I’m sorry for being selfish sir” and he didn’t answer me. At all. And later, I realized that he had talked with all of my choirmates and had asked them what they learned from this experience. And one of my closest friends went to me and that’s when I lost it. I couldn’t breathe for hours and I just kept on sobbing and screaming. He just walked away. The next occurance like this was when this time, my aunt called. I was at our school cafeteria at the time. Both she and I don’t have a great relationship because whenever she’s in a bad mood, she would mutter the words “Your siblings were never as bad as you” “It’s better if you just leave” “Leche ka. Buwiset ka.” - those are Filipino words that mean that I’m annoying and such. And I went inside a bathroom stall and I started crying. When I went out, one of my guy friends had asked me if I was okay and that’s when I snapped and he gave me a seat and he held my hand and I just started squeezing it because I wasn’t able to breathe for hours and our friends were there too trying to give me water and telling me to count until 10. I started telling them that I couldn’t feel anything. My legs, my hands, my guy friend’s hands, nothing. And I couldn’t speak properly. It had been 3 hours already and so I just told them that I was okay and I still couldn’t breathe but I’ll be fine. But when we got to the nurse’s office, I sat back down because I literally was feeling like I was on drugs or something bc I was getting so dizzy and lightheaded and I couldn’t get up anymore. They started bringing in an oxygen tank and gave me a pink pill and they said that it was supposed to knock me out, but it did nothing of the sort, so they admitted me to the ER and they rubbed something on me and I fell asleep. The 3rd occurance was last night. I’M SORRY for this long-ass thing, but if you’re still reading, bless you🙏 

Last night, my teacher had told me that I messed up my project and IT WAS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ONE, like literally, but I really flunked it. So I couldn’t breathe for hours and hours and hours and I started throwing the pillows at the wall because my chest hurt so bad and I was all alone and my friends weren’t here to calm me down or get me some help and stuff. What eventually calmed me down was when my dog jumped up my bed and just looked at me. Right now, I have a blade and it’s not cutting my skin like at all. I’m afraid to get some therapy because my parents believe that its only for crazy people. Do you guys think I need therapy? What are your thoughts after reading all of this? Thank you for taking the time and reaching this far. I’d appreciate it if y’all commented something down below because I really need summ help right now. Do y’all experience this stuff to? Because when my parents found out about me not being able to breathe and being admitted to the hospital, they said maybe I was having a stroke or might probably be getting the coronavirus symptoms.

The worst is not the bad words of the teacher, but its WHEN he said - at the WORST possible time, when youre so agitated and vulnerable. Im seriously thinking if that teacher is too detrimental to your mental health to continue. Your mental health is important, and you are in need of help, not scolding.

That teacher is bringing up your baseline anxiety A LOT, he will break you down, the increasing stress will bring you down. You NEED some fresh air from that teacher. When you rest and recover you will be not as sensitive and will be able to control yourself in front of that teacher.

People hold on pause their jobs or career when they breakdown mentally, like you. The same way when you injure yourself physically, you take time off, so when you are broken mentally, you take a rest too.

Also I wonder if medication is not making it worse. Antidepressants generally work fine and have that  calming down effect on emotional sensitivity and irritability. Most ADs wiil help, however one was different ""venlafaxine"" which made me even more irritable and depressed. I started sleeping 16-18hours per day and felt extremely emotionally sensitivity to tiny bits of stress or negativity.

To say that things moved on quickly is a severe understatement. Right now, it's 3:35am and I have been awake for the last 95 mins just wanting to hear my father's voice. To know that all that I'm doing for my own family is enough; that I'm not a failure as a son or as a husband or father. Sure, my wife tells me that I'm not a failure, but it's not the same. I just want to hear my father's reassurance one more time.

I can't find a voicemail or a video. Not a single one and it's crushing me more and more. So I sent him a message on facebook since I know his cell phone is long disconnected and his number more than likely recycled.

1st. You may think that putting on a brave face to give the rest of your family members the impression you're doing ok or you want them to see you as someone who can handle anything that comes your way, you may think that's helping you. But it is not! You are holding in some really strong, heavy and painful emotions and you need help with processing them. Whether that is a moment you have in front of your wife where you breakdown and cry or scream or both at the same time, you have to process them. Do not bottle them up. Not just for your sake but also for your kids sake. Show them how a real grown man deals with losing his father. Not the version of grown men we are familiar with. The ones who don't cry or show they are sad and never sensitive. This is a learning opportunity as shitty as it may be but an experience life hands you that you never wanted but here you are, use it to at the very least teach your kids it's ok to be sad. It's ok to not have everything together and it's ok to need help and be helped in times like these. They are all there for you. All you gotta do is let them know what's hurting and they will help you. It's what family does for each other.🙂

2nd. U/Gsnow. This guy is a reddit legend. Maybe you've already heard about this before. Doesn't hurt to read it again. If you haven't though you're in for an unbelievable interpretation of grief. And as dead on (no pun intended, for real) as it is it is just as beautiful and comforting.

For a little background, I'm a man in my early 20's living in a country where a diploma pretty much makes or breaks your future. From a very young age I was already pegged for success and things were going well but the problem was that as I grew older I just became more and more depressed. 2 1/2 years into a pre-med course, I met some like-minded individuals who also weren't happy and we decided to fuck everything up. A failed suicide attempt and a whole semester out of school later I went back to uni now in an English course which screwed me over after 1 1/2 semester as they changed the curriculum and required me to go back to freshman year. I lost the courage and the patience. I've been out of school for a whole year now and I've been faking it to the people I know by editing my grades on the internet. Now I've fallen out of touch with my parents because I've disappointed them too much and I'm stuck in a joyless career which is neither meaningful or helping me grow. I also have a girlfriend who means the world to me who's older and is taking her Doctorate. She's expecting me to finish anytime soon, get a real career and finally settle down. I feel like everyone's expecting something from me that I can't deliver. I've done fucked up so much that I don't even know where to begin fixing things. Honestly, I don't even know what has kept me going. Back in late 2018 I attempted suicide. Before 2019 ended I promised that I won't reach the New Year. But oddly enough I'm still here but I'm afraid I might finally burnout. I haven't sought help since my attempt since it was the meds that I tried to do it with.

  I’m sorry you’re in so much pain, let alone a host of extreme negative emotions. You are totally allowed to feel that way - it is what you do with those thoughts and feelings. And you are NOT a failure for your actions. Even though I haven’t taken any higher education classes, I have the same views of a degree as you do. You are NOT a failure. You HAVE NOT messed everything up. 

  I think it’s amazing you have gotten this far. When you are actually living life, DOING something with yourself - mistakes are going to happen. I’m not saying suffering is a sure sign of progress - but sometimes just surviving is all that you can do. Even if you’re treading in complete darkness. But you made it another day.

I spent most of my life as a high functioning person and was always in the top 10% of the population income wise.  I've had issues (depression, eating disorders) since I was a kid but I was always able to ""handle"" it and stay high functioning.  Then, over 6 months, I lost my job after 25 years and with the end of my paycheque, so ended my marriage.  That was it, I had no strength left to put up my front and I dropped quickly into a deep depression.

&#x200B;

Well 5 years later I'm divorced, still unemployed, completely broke and barely surviving financially, have panic attacks when I try to job search, and have zero confidence left in myself.  I feel like a total and complete failure in every aspect of my life.  I even feel like a horrible father because some days I can barely handle the normal stresses of dealing with a young kid and I give into her too often which is leading her down some bad paths health and habit wise.  Almost all my friends are gone.  My supposed best friend left me not long after she saw me at my absolute worst when I was in the hospital after an aborted suicide attempt.   She decided our 20 year friendship meant nothing because I ""must always have been a secret narcissist"".  When she left, two of my other very close friends went with her since they were closer to her and felt uncomfortable staying my friend given her feelings.  Other friends I wasn't as close with disappeared when I was slow to reply to them during bouts of depression.  They decided I didn't care or wasn't worth it.  Some just didn't know how to deal with me when I was always down and they had known me as the up guy who was always there to support others.

I have nothing left.  There is nothing inside of me.  I want to die all the time. I've been though treatment.  3 doctors, 2 hospital visits, multiple drugs, TMS treatments, ECT treatments, day therapy programs, DBT/CBT training, anything they wanted me to try I did.  Nothing.  I move between moderately depressed on the best day to severely depressed on an average day.  What joys I get last only for a few minutes before I go dead inside again.  My latest doctor when I showed some optimism about trying to change said ""its not realistic to expect you will ever be back to near where you once were again"" and that he discouraged me from even trying to find work.  I can't live feeling like I have no purpose but leaching off of society and not even having enough to do the things that are important to me.  No money, no job, no friends, what's left?

I can't properly describe it, but I could not stop crying. And this happens almost all the time. No matter what I do or how I distract myself, the pain always comes back. It's why whenever I get done with a walk or finish doing something fun, I start crying again. I think it's getting worse. Nothing I used to feel better was enough anymore. I wanted to take a knife and carve the ache out of my chest, but it doesn't work that way.

So I thought about cutting myself. I always wondered what it would be like, but never seriously considered it until last night. I even went as far as getting a knife. I got scratched by my cat before so I figured if it was anything like that it wouldn't be a big deal. And cutting supposedly took away from the emotional pain, so it would be worth it. I ultimately didn't do it. Mostly because summer is coming, and I'd have to wear short sleeves. Also because I chickened out. I would like to say I'm proud for not doing it, but I'm mostly just upset and angry. I'm tired of this. As hard as it is living with depression, I never understood why anyone would want to cut.

(Sorry for the long post. I don’t know if there’s any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in) 

I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didn’t want anyone to know, so I’ve never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15+ years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you’re all I got. 

Over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. But we don’t have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don’t sleep together hardly, we don’t have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - I’ve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that I’ve all but given up at this point, even when it’s your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. I’ve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she’s gotten worked up and basically says she doesn’t feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we’ve talked it’s always that she’s not in the mood. I feel like she’s not telling me something. 

I feel as if we’ve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that she’s cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think it’s just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it’s frustrating me lately. I honestly don’t mean to sound like a jerk here; I’m certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. 

I don’t even know how to explain how I’m feeling. I’m constantly having the internal debate: “Well what about me?”- “Fuck about you! What about her!?” And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.

Headspace A: 
“That being said.. why can’t it be about me sometimes? Shouldn’t a relationship be 50/50? I’ve really never been an attention seeker so I’m fine with 30/70 or 20/80? Anything at this point. It’s not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.”

Headspace B:
“A few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldn’t breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying “she just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die” I love her so much and i’m scared for her and for us.”

Am I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course I’ve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I don’t say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. I’m just angry at this situation and don’t know how else to react. 

I want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship? How do I bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do I bring it up at all? 

Thanks so much for any help.

You cannot fix things for them so you need to set some boundaries (hard but that’s what she said), 2. Lead by example and he may follow (if exercise helps make him feel better then I should say I want to go for a walk and maybe he will join me ), 3. If he is panicking, you need to de escalate and not have serious conversations in that moment. Talk about them when he can think rationally. ... that’s all I can remember off hand but I wrote it all on my computer and I’ll message you again because I do want to share what helped. Hope you’re well! :)  ",2019-01-18 18:21:21

That’s not very much imo. I remember starting college, it seems overwhelming for a week or two, but then you get used to it - it’s not nearly as much as it sounds. For some reason when you start, it’s kind of a time warp. When you go from studying 2 hours a week in high school to 20-30 hours a week in college, it seems like a lot, but it really isn’t. 

Try going to the library rather than studying at home. This helps a LOT. Everyone else in the building is working and time flies by, it will help you concentrate and not worry about other things you want to do. Eventually you will actually like studying. 

But yeah, not a huge deal if you drop it either way. Just talk to a counselor first to make sure there’s no big consequences to doing so. ",2019-01-26 01:48:35

It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. 

However recently I have been feeling really down & depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often & struggle to stop.

And that’s the first step of getting out of a depression by yourself but make sure YOU want to get out of depression.

Here are the things I did. I started practising this every damn day.

I try to write down my diary and track my mood. Think that:

&#x200B;

1. I want to      feel okay. I want to wake up everyday with smile on my face. I want to      wake up everyday filled with a hope knowing that everything will be      alright.
2. I want to      feel lovely, I want to feel what it’s like to be someone who matters.      Someone who counts for something who will forever remain a memory.
3. I want to      feel alive. I want to feel sun’s warmth above my head and grow like a      flower that always experiences spring. I want to feel what it’s like to be      the best version of me.
4. I want to      be in love, I want a love that makes me feel free like a bird flying      towards the blue sky. I want a love that comes from me.

It works for me and I feel relaxing after writing down. It is hard to find a suitable app to write conveniently. Finally, my best friend develop one for me, named '[Stars Diary – Journal, Mood, Note, Password](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sognarestudio.stars)'.

It really helps me, I express my feeling with music and photo and capture them in app. Release my feeling from my brain.

you bottle everything up , so no one knows how you truly feel . you’re tired of the way things are & feeling this way . you’re tired of faking your way through life by pretending to be this strong & happy person . you’re tired of having to put up so many walls to protect yourself

you may feel put down by others & the things they say , but you don’t say anything because you don’t want anyone else to feel the way you do . you want everyone to like you , even when you know it’s better to just steer away from them

you’ve been hurt before , maybe more than once . you refuse to let anyone in because you fear they won’t stay . you want to be happy more than anything , but you’re scared you’ll ruin it . you fear that you’ll run off the only good thing that has ever happened to you
so many people who struggle with depression hesitate to get help because of a stigma . our society has conditioned us to be ashamed of our “negative” emotions

we’re reminded of how lucky we are , of how many would feel blessed to be in our shoes , etc . but in reality , that doesn’t help with depression . is depressed people know our circumstances & i for one often feel guilty for being sad despite everything

let me tell you something . you’re beautiful . you’re strong . you’re better than this . you can & will overcome it , if you believe you can . there are other people just like you , all over the world that are going through this with you . you’re not alone

there are people in your life that care about you & would do anything they possibly could for you . those people that hurt you aren’t worth you crying over . you should never let anyone make you feel less important than you are
one day you’ll be happy , look back on this & realize how much time you wasted worrying about people who don’t even matter . you’ll have people in your life that make you feel so blessed that you may even forget this

stay strong & remember that you’re all strong , beautiful , amazing individuals who deserve the world & are destined for greatness ❤️ .

 I can’t keep this up. I can’t keep smiling and pretending I’m cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day.

I'm a 26 year old woman and I suffer from depression. I'm in therapy and on antidepressants. I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, I've made a lot of progress and I'm quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow I'll leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace (I'm in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections). 

Problem: I don't know anyone in this city so I'll be alone for seven days. Yes, I'll meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day I'll return to my hotel room and I'll be alone. And I'm very scared. 

This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist:

\- focusing on the public selection;

\- bringing my favourite books;

\- Netflix for the nights;

\- going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food

\- visiting the city in my spare time

694,em3ykb,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,19,Is it worth trying more anti-depressants?,depression_help,"Hey everyone,

My depression has been out of control over the last year. It's always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. I've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time I've been talked into anti-depressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. 

Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another I'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now I'm very apprehensive about even trying another SSRI/SNRI

As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the world's richest third world country(the U.S.), all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for.

Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRI's and I'm fucking terrified that they'll make me feel like he last one and I'll give in and do it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/em3ykb/is_it_worth_trying_more_antidepressants/,52,"Are you working with a psychiatrist who knows your medication history? 

Also what is the source of depression. Are you able to sit down and think about what is causing you to be depressed. For example for years I was depressed and I just didn’t know why and life seemed pointless. Than I realized I was having existential questions and spirituality questions like what the purpose of life is type stuff. I was making little to no progress in therapy until I started exploring the existential questions that made me uncomfortable. Reading and researching about religions and spirituality and atheism made me feel SO much better than any medication or therapy. 


I also at one point had become depressed because  of my traumatic childhood. My father commit suicide and burned down our house leaving me and my siblings to grow up single parent and extremely poor. This never affected me till I became an adult. I would think about it every day for hours and hours and hours convincing myself that I was going to end up like him. This was extremely depressing as you can imagine. So I tried EMDR to address the source of this trauma and it really helped me a good bit! Again more than the medications. 


So I’m not saying to get off meds, in fact the meds can help you utilize the tools you learn in therapy with a more clear mind. I tried them a few times and they did help when I needed them. But, if there is something deeply rooted in you that you haven’t explored or questioned, the meds are not an end all be all solution. I wish you luck OP! My DMs are open :)

Oh edit also:

Make sure you are getting your human basic needs. Sunlight every day, exercise(do it outside if possible)  good sleep(i require 8-9 hours or I have terrible anxiety), socialization with other people, hobbies, some type of purpose or spirituality or a group of people that you meet up with, some type of sense of belonging. These things make a HUGE difference. For me once I started a weekly hobby that made me a group of friends and taking daily walks in the sun, it helped so much. ",2020-01-09 03:33:11

A little while back I had some serious problems with depression and many times I used the chat service Blahtherapy as a release by helping people on the weekends. However, in the past couple months the chat quality has dropped severely and I find the site is often overrun with bots or trolls. It really seems like they are putting all their effort into the online therapist portion of their site and leaving the far more popular chat aspect as an afterthought.

After a couple weeks of this I decided I could do better myself so I made the site [MellowTalk](https://mellowtalk.com) to replace the platform. My site is also for the purpose of mental health and is free with no ads, forever. It pairs listeners and talkers in one-on-one conversations with the talkers being given the ability to give the listeners points if they feel like they are doing a good job, making them ascend up a leaderboard. All names are silly and randomly generated and refresh at the beginning of every chat making things totally anonymous and safe. Inbound and outbound connections are also heavily encrypted so I promise there is complete and total privacy. I designed the site based on what I wanted and I only hope that other people might want it too. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I don't want anyone else to have that experience.

It's a very small site right now. Very, very small. And totally community funded, so not exactly profitable.

And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feel-good escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I can't even use that, since the type of movies and shows I'm interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they don't, the representation is poorly handled.

&#x200B;

I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I've seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn't exist within these genres.

But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.

&#x200B;

And furthermore, people ARE getting more gay-supportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better.

I have one last semester left before I graduate. I feel empty inside and I feel like I haven’t done much fun stuff with college. 

I’m 22 and still a virgin/never been in a relationship (although I have been kissed but that was at a parties/clubs by strangers, and very rarely, so meaningless), and it’s eating me up, because I feel like no one wants me. The few girls who I got “close” with (and by close I mean talking) turned me down, and last semester I got friendzoned by the girl I liked. I have no clues how to date or how to initiate intimacy. All of my friends have had sex/dated and I feel so left out. I’ve lied to people about my lack of success just so I don’t get mocked.

I’ve been underweight most of my life too and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to put on weight or bulk up. I’ve never been athletic and don’t have anything to show for that. I’m also not an interesting person, or had any interesting life experiences. I don’t have enough money to travel, and don’t really have any unique hobbies or skills. When I was in high school my parents were very strict and never let me go out, which I feel has socially stunted me. 

I don’t know if I’ll get a job after graduation (despite being in a decent field) and when I return home i feel like I’ll be stuck at there NEETing and working minimum wage jobs. Two of my closest friends have got jobs laid out after gradation.

I have to return to school next week to finish my internship and to start my master's thesis. I'm very nervous about going back, due to the pressure of work and school. Being on the other side of the planet and far from my family doesn't help either. I also have serious regrets about what I studied for my bachelor's and my first master's degree, as I've found it incredibly difficult finding work in my field. I feel like I've wasted a lot of time by choosing poorly regarding what to study.

As sad or discouraged as you may be feeling, I strongly recommend that you look for some fun/interesting hobbies; not so that you sound like an ''interesting'' person to others, but rather for your own personal/mental development. Trust me, from my personal experience, it helps so much as a distraction from and a way to cope with whatever negative feelings you may be having. Also, you have a lot of time to change what you want to study or to pursue a completely different field altogether! Don't feel trapped or like your career is headed for a dead end.

715,eeyh7o,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,17,How to coexist with depressed people (by someone with chronic depression),depression_help,"Maybe a throwaway? I don't know. I'm depressed (have been managing it with increasing success over the last 10 years) and this post was inspired by this recent post in the sub: [https://old.reddit.com/r/depression\_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody\_likes\_you\_when\_youre\_depressed/](https://old.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody_likes_you_when_youre_depressed/). Please feel free to add your own suggestions, these are the ones that came to mind for me. 

1. Don't tell us what we're capable of doing or have the potential to do. We're already doing our best. 
2. Providing love and support for us where we're at is the secret to getting us to function better, but sometimes even support doesn't counteract a really hard day. Be okay with this. 
3. Stop giving us advice on how to become less depressed unless we ask for it specifically. See #2. 
4. Before you say that we are perpetuating our own bad situations, remember that you are missing several factors that create a person with depression: environment, income, home life, schooling, abuse factors, etc. 
5. If you are involved in a power dynamic-oriented relationship with us (parents, bosses, etc.), you are the last person that should be pushing boundaries or forcing us to ""go outside"". But you are the first person who should be ensuring that you aren't pushing us too hard. 
6. People who don't want to take pills are not making excuses. Concerns about SSRIs are not unfounded, and it's up to us to weigh the risks and benefits with their doctor/psychiatrist. 
7. We're not always sad. Sometimes we're angry. Sometimes we're numb. Sometimes we seem completely cheerful and normal and hide all of our symptoms as best we can. 
8. Sometimes we *do* make it much worse with our own downward spirals and negative inner-talk. Telling us this does nothing to solve that problem. Refer to #2. 
9. Therapists - get extra rest. Take care of yourself. Do not take on too many patients. Be sure that this is what you really want to do, because people are counting on you to truly care. Be careful how you talk about people's mental health situations, because your compassion fatigue can and will rear its ugly head. 
10. If you're sick of us whining about our problems, it means you need a break from whatever is stressing you out and shouldn't be trying to support anyone's depression. Take a vacation. Go on a date. Focus on yourself. 
11. If you're close to us, ask if you can do specific things to help (if you want to). Offer to make food, clean up, or run errands on a bad day. Maybe all we need is someone to sit next to or a hug. Maybe we need some time alone. Maybe we finally need a ride to a counselor's office or hospital. Ask. 
12. Don't support us in the hopes that your efforts will ""fix"" our depression. It's something you have to be willing to accept without expectations of anything changing. We may beat depression, but some of us take longer or will continue to struggle with it our whole lives - if this makes you uncomfortable, that sounds like a you problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eeyh7o/how_to_coexist_with_depressed_people_by_someone/,51,How do people beat depression? ,2019-12-24 08:11:43
716,c9toup,False,INSPIRATION,8,"A note, from me to me",depression_help,"  

Apologies in advance for how long this is. I’m not honestly not even entirely sure why I wanted to post this here. I suppose I need to say this somewhere that seems a bit more real than just my brain. Somewhere I can actually hear myself say it rather than just let it go on loop in my head, until all the words lose their meaning and the whole thing ends up drifting away from me like an empty boat aimed at some dark shadowy place out of sight. I’m just afraid that if I don’t really try to say this properly, then it’ll go to that place and this moment will be just one more thing I let float away from me. And I suppose this whole post will probably be as self-absorbed and over-described and rehashed as I’m worried it will sound. Probably even more than that. But I couldn’t give a shit anymore, because more than afraid of what I’m going to sound like, and how I’m coming across, and what people might think of me, more than any of that, I’m just tired. And I’m sad. And I want to get off this ride I’ve been taking myself on for way too long. And I know that probably sounds like a pretty ominous start to a post on a subreddit filled with some pretty ominous posts, but don’t worry, it’s not going to be like that. This ain’t gonna end with someone needing to call an ambulance. Not fucking today. 

But first, an intro.

If you ask me on any other day, I’ll say I see myself as a basically lump of a person. As a meat sack. I imagine myself sometimes as like a piece of soft and sagging flesh, like the human equivalent of that part under the arm that jiggles when you move. And my greatest fear is that I’m going to sit on this couch and waste until I eventually kill myself, or until the world moves on and I’m left sort of stuck here in my own pocket of time. And then I kill myself. And honestly, a lot of the time suicide seems like the best non-solution I’ve got. It’s the one I understand the most. Because where suicide is a small and easy full stop, the other option is something really long and complex and so impossible to understand from where I’m standing that it starts to looks as if there’s just no way it’s possible. That it’s basically beyond me. And this is where it gets really tricky, and this is the part that I need to say to myself. 

But, before I do. I need to stress that this is not at all meant as a comment on anyone else here. Y’all keep doing what you need to do to keep those chins right up high, and don’t let anyone tell you that you aren’t doing otherwise. Because I’m certain everyone here is doing absolutely everything they know how to do to be and get better. So don’t let this little rant of mine feel like another voice of criticism, this is really just a conversation between me and me, one that’s been a long time coming. But anyway. Back to rant.

From what I can see of myself, the real guilt and shame of it all is that there are definitely things I could be doing. Tricky, complex things sure, but still small and manageable things I can do every day that I’m simply not doing. That what feels to me like barely managing to stay afloat is actually surrendering one inch at a time. That what I’m really doing is buying into the depression paradox that I can’t unfuck myself because I’m already so fucked up that it’s going to be impossible to even try to fix it. That I can’t fix my own problems because I’m going to fold when it gets tough. And then, when I do fold, I’m going to cry and hate and blame myself for folding and then use the whole cry/hate/self-blame experience as fuel to beat myself up so bad that I can feel like justice has been served for giving up. That I’ll punish myself on behalf of the depression so it can trick me into feeling justified to say “Stop! Please! I’m already in so much pain, why are you making me do even one thing more.” A sort of you-can’t-hate-me-if-I-hate-myself-more strategy. And therefore I win. Or the depression wins I guess. It wins by having me prove to myself that I’m useless and feckless and that clearly the whole thing is not my fault because when I try to fix myself, I end up being in so pain that I have to stop, and so clearly the whole thing is because of some inherent quality I’ve got. That I’m fundamentally weak. And therefore, that there’s no point even trying.

And this is where the truly evil part occurs, the real grotesque sharp-toothed evil-eyed element of this whole thing, because then I get to believe it. Because I want to believe it. Because then I get to vindicate myself. I am no longer pathetic, a wastrel, not doing enough to help myself and unable to do anything. Instead, I’m damaged. Deformed in some way that’s just too hard to pull apart. Which is bullshit because I know this is just what the shitty black tarred side of my brain wants me to believe. I know what it wants more than anything else is for me to buy so deeply into its power over me that I start believing it is me. That I start doing its job for it. And I’m so fucking done with it. I am seriously **so** fucking done with it. Let me just say that again.

I.

Am.

So.

Fucking.

Done.

With.

It.

I’m done with this pathetic vagrant type of life I’ve been letting myself live, this habit of settling into something and then immediately looking for an exit strategy because I certain it’s not gonna work. I’m done with dipping a toe in and letting the depression convince me that it’s too cold, or it’s not the right colour of blue, or that it’s just not the right time of the year to start trying to fucking fix myself. I’m done with doing the depression’s job for it. And so this is it. This is my promise to myself. I am going to make the depression fucking work for it. And if it wants to kill me, it’s going to have to kill itself first trying to figure out how to do it. I am not its fucking slave. And here are some other things I’m going to do.

I’m gonna keep going to therapy, even if some days it feels like it’s not doing a fucking thing. I’m gonna keep going. 

I’m gonna stop letting the depression tell me that I’m fundamentally damaged. It’s not true. There are, for sure, a lot of things I need to work out, and I’ll do it one step at a time, but I am not incapable of taking those steps.

I’m gonna stop beating myself up when I go for one of those steps and miss. I am not going to punish myself for missing. Not only is that not fair, or even realistic to believe as being possible, but it’s just plain unhelpful in trying to get back up again.

Here are some other things I’m going to do.

I’m gonna mediate more. I’m gonna exercise more. I’m gonna attend to my thoughts more honestly. And, more than anything, I am going to learn how to live for the sake of fucking living and not for the sake of just surviving.

That’s it. Rant over. I’m going to put on some shoes and then go have a smoke outside and try to see if there are any stars out tonight.

Telling you he regrets marrying you wasn't a nice thing to say but at the end of the day, its honest. Finding your SO is finding someone who can handle your specific lows as well as enjoy your highs. This just sounds like a good indication that you two are not to be. 

That would be crippling even if you weren't depressed so having depression just makes it feel so much worse. There's nothing I can really say to alleviate the pain. This is the kind of pain that is really only healed over time. The only way I can think of to speed it up is to grow as a person. Try not to hate him. Just as you have your struggles, some people can't handle the stress of being with someone afflicted with depression or like illnesses. That doesn't make you unworthy or pathetic or weak. There are billions of people on this planet all with different needs/desires/fears/pet peeves. Honestly, its a miracle anyone can find the right person to be with. 

Your brain will tell you its your fault or that you aren't worthy. But try to remember, that's the crazy talking. That's the part of our brain that's broken or misfiring. However you want to think of it. Logically or rationally speaking, you have gained relationship experience that you can use to have a better relationship moving forward and have just narrowed search for your SO. 

You're going to hurt. Depression is cruel that way. Just try to remember that the depression is making you overreact. You aren't terrible or a mistake or pathetic.

723,byz4jp,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,47,Seeking advice for working with depressed partner,depression_help," Hi all,

I've been dating a really wonderful woman (mid 20's) for about half of a year that has been depressed for the last couple of months.

At first she was mostly quiet, tired, and sad, but she was responsive enough to tell me she couldn't hang out because she wasn't feeling great. I understood that she was isolating herself, so I gave her space and tried to be understanding. We still saw each other once or twice a week, but we communicated a lot less.

Now she's becoming more irritable, less responsive, and frankly not very nice to me. I've been taking the mean comments/criticism in stride and talking with her as if what she said wasn't mean. But it's beginning to take a toll on me. She's also shut down affection/intimacy for the last month which has made me feel less close to her (but I understand that can disappear). She also asked for more space this past weekend (which was an easy thing to say okay to, being that we're not even seeing other very much right now).

I think I need to have a boundaries conversation with her so that I can outline that I need her to try to be less critical of me, to talk to me about what I'm doing that isn't working / what she would rather I be doing, and to talk to me about why affection has died between us and what we could do instead to maintain closeness in our relationship.

Could somebody give me feedback on if having a boundaries conversation with her would be a good / bad idea?

My name is Nick Casaletto and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 12 years now. I’ve seen therapist, been on countless medication and have the support system of an amazing wife. But, my depression would always creep up unexpectedly, as I’m sure a lot of you can relate, it’s not exactly fun. 

My only outlet has been movies. Since around the time I started to notice my depression at around 18 years old, I found myself sitting in my bedroom and finding solace in cinema. It was the only place I would feel comfortable being myself, my only escape from the world. 

After all of this time, my depression has matured with me. What started out as something I dealt with by countlessly drinking until I was black out drunk, to my now current quiet depression. The kind that makes you stuck in your thoughts that’s on a constant loop. I thought, (loving movies and having become accustomed to the craft of editing) why not make my voice heard. Not as a cry for help, but for others who feel like me, and can relate to the visual medium. 

Please note: the short movie is to a song that really inspired me, I was blessed enough to have the licensing and support from the band.

743,fsg3bf,False,RANT,5,"Drunk and sad, wrote a paragraph and was wondering how many feel the same.",depression_help,"Warning: drunk so the writing may not be too coherent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is certainly hard to accept ones flaw, especially because most of the times that single flaw ends up at the center of it all and you start using it as an excuse for everything else.  
Why you can't do this and why you can't do that.  
Everything ends up being caused by that one thing, to the point where you think about how life could be were it not for \*this\*.

You would obviously be more successful, lead a better life and be more social,

but would you?  
How much do you let your own faults dictate what you can and can't do in life.  
How much time have you lost just sulking in your own sadness instead of trying to do something.

Of course I am a hypocrite too, writing about this is extremely easy while actually taking action for yourself, well, that's a whole other story.  
I never did manage to do it (take action, that is) yet advising others with the knowledge of my own struggles seems so easy.  
The answer is right there, in plain sight, with nothing stopping you from reaching it. But then you do try to reach it you suddenly understand how hard it actually is.  
Sometimes I wonder, if I do take that leap, if I do reach the solution, would it be so simple? No, it isn't something that clicks and suddenly your whole life gets better, that would be too easy. Instead it's something extremely hard, that you have to keep up for the rest of your life; and the only thing going for it, it's that every day it becomes a little bit easier.  
Maybe you did try it, you did try to get better but you relapsed into the old habits and the old sulking, then you also understand how easy it is to lose all the progress you tried to make.  
So there you are, or even, there I am; in what seems like a bottomless pit of sadness that you can never reach out of, but can always fall deeper in.  
What are you doing there? Waiting and hoping for something to change? Attempting suicide? Or maybe, like me, you just ask yourself why you can't seem to free yourself from it, why does everyone else look like they managed it while you can't. Is it just easier for other people? Did they have to struggle less than you? Or are you not good enough, are you not strong enough to do it. But why? Why would you not be good enough? Afterall you were born like that, were you not? Oh, maybe that's too easy; blaming it on how you were born, putting the blame off from your shoulders. No, that doesn't seem right, you should have to bear all that weight, after all you deserve it don't you?  
So you are here, after all the thoughts you've had, still in the same pit.  
Living life one day after the other, but without any lasting joy, just going on with your life in autopilot mode, trying to sleep as much as possible to avoid living, while not having the courage, or perhaps selfishness, to end it.

A couple of days before I posted I'd suffered a severe head injury. What I didn't know at the time was that severe depression can be caused or complicated by a concussion. Part of my sudden depth of feeling was down to the concussion, which was making me teary and have a breakdown at work. 

Well my boss sat with me and telling me I wasn't worthless until my mum picked me up and was able to get me a doctors appointment where they explained that whilst not causing the depression the sudden urge to self harm etc might be caused by the temporary instability. So I'm booked in to get some help with the underlying depression in the next couple of weeks. In the mean time i'm trying what I can to feel okay, exercising and finding things to be thankful for.

746,euoo1d,False,OTHER,8,This day sucks,depression_help,"I don't know, maybe I'm being pathetic. But things do get to me.

It started the moment I woke up. I go on twitter and see this horrible news that one of the famous basketball icons, Kobe Bryant was gone. What shattered my heart was that his daughter had died with him. I never really liked basketball that much but I was shocked when tears started to roll down my face.

I slept at 4AM and woke up at around 8:30AM to get ready for school. I had exams today and I guess I tried my best to be prepared for it. 

When I took the exam, the two proctors were whispering to one another. I found out later on that they were gossiping about how they thought my classmate's boyfriend was ugly, which had ticked me off btw, they were both fresh graduates and were waiting to pass the teachers licensing exam, so I found that despicable. Anyway, it really annoyed me and I found myself shushing them, because I couldn't focus. Then the proctor just smiled at me and sarcastically said ""If I'm making too much noise for you, then please leave the classroom so you can take the exam in peace."" It irritated me to my core, so I said ""fuck it"" and wrote whatever the fuck I want on that piece of paper.

In the afternoon, I kinda skipped class with my best friend to grab milkteas. I had just found out that she has this heart disease and it's keeping me on edge; so I want to spend as much time with her as possible before her operation.

We just got back and headed to the library. I remembered I had forgotten to bring ""professional"" clothes for our film. So I told my other ""best friend"" that I had forgotten it. But she cut me off before finishing my sentence by yelling ""shut up a second"". That had really ticked me off. After that, I remained quiet, scrolling on my phone.

After that, the girl that had cut me off half sentence said ""hey, did you guys remember to bring clothes today"" and I answered ""I tried to tell you but you cu-"" ""why the fuck would you tell me? Do I seem like the leader or something"" she cut me off the second time. This time, it really pissed me off. She had done this before and I always made sure to stay quiet as to not make another fuss. I don't like conflicts because I can be quite the debater. 

She proceeded to spit out sarcastic remarks in front of our classmates in order to embarrass me further, I guess. So, I just stepped out and went to our office.

Now, I'm writing this with a really heavy feeling in my chest. I may just be pitying myself and being pathetic but I just feeĺ sucky that I don't want to tell any of my friends how I really feel right now. I guess, having strangers read this and not judge you is better for me. What my friend said to me really just hurt me. But I don't want to admit that to anyone that knows me personally.

750,do7trc,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,7,Two Depressed people in a relationship,depression_help,"I’m really struggling and need some support right now.  

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately.  We’ve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness.  I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression.  He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed.

The depression started creeping up beginning of September.  At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding.  

But now, it’s manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end.  I can’t even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me.  I’m misfiring and crying uncontrollably.  And I’m constantly battling between my intellect and what I know (he’s depressed, it’s not a choice, he doesn’t mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when he’s withdrawn, etc.) and my anxiety monologue (something is wrong, because I am wrong, and he’s not telling me because he wants me to break up with him/hurt me).

The major difference between us is, I have a support system.  I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check.  But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being.

He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist (though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past).

And it’s also screwed with our intimate side (which I think is a lot of the source of ire).  Sex is important, but my partner’s well being is of course more important.  I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks he’s been so down, we can’t connect on that level.  I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired.  A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert.

It’s really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory.  I am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/do7trc/two_depressed_people_in_a_relationship/,54,"Look, I'm going to say something you don't want to hear right now, but I say it in the honest belief that it is the right thing to say:

This relationship is not worth destroying yourself over.

Love just isn't enough sometimes. While I do believe in fighting past rough patches in relationships and supporting each other, I also believe that sometimes we encounter situations where our wellbeing might become damaged if we try to do that. This sounds like something that is going to be an ongoing problem in this relationship, so you need to consider whether it is worth it, and whether you can handle it. I'm not suggesting you break up with him, but I am suggesting that if you need to step back then do so.

Now that I've said that, I think you might do well to do what you can to help yourself first. Use that support system to keep yourself together as well as possible, and (if you haven't) read up on depression and methods of dealing with it. If he's luke warm about therapy, there are other tools out there he might be more willing to try. You might even suggest you do them together.

Also, if you're having trouble with intimacy right now, try replacements. Cuddling and massages are good physical replacements, and the former can be done watching tv together or something. Make it as easy as possible for him to be engaged or with you - even just being in the same room as him and doing your own thing will allow him to know you're there for him, but giving him space. He might be withdrawn, but trust me that knowing that you care for him and are around will be important to him.

That said, don't be afraid to take a few days break. Text him, message him, whatever, but go and do something for you. A small break might be exactly what you need to better support him and not implode. And, it might do him some good too.

Does he suffer from SAD? Winter months can be really tough for some people. ",2019-10-28 11:57:47

I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. 
Since then I’ve dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. 
Since starting school I’ve realized I’ve become incredibly isolated. The only time I’ll have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I won’t have a conversation with anyone.  Even my parents don’t talk to me everyday. 
I’ve joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? 
My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that I’m training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies don’t care if you have depression - they need to be trained. 
I’ve also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly don’t see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month.

Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits.

Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please!

I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced.

Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, I've seen garbage fires that look better than her. Mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. But that's when everything went to shit. Mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. She took a test, and showed me the results. I don't know what to do, I can't let my wife, or kids find out. Mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. She has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. She tells me she doesn't want to be ""just the other woman."" She doesn't want to be ""a dirty little secret."" I don't know what to do. I got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. I haven't been going to work for the past few days now, I've been making sure Mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, I'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. I can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. I need your help, please, what should I do? I need help, and advice. I want to save the marriage, I can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. I hate this whole fucking situation. I hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? How can I convince Mandy not to tell my wife? I don't know what to do, should I get a restraining order on her? Please help me anyone, I don't know who to go to for help.

I haven’t gone through what you are going through but it seams to me like you aren’t happy with your wife because you feel like she’s controlling you, right?

You said that you don’t want her finding out about Mandy because you fear what could happen?

Well I’m sorry to say, you’ll have to deal with that, you slept around and as far as I know, didn’t use protection so the chance of something like this happening is high, as you now found out.

I’d recommend asking yourself if you love mandy or your wife and I’m not just talking about pussy here either, I mean you’re actually happy to see the woman and like I said, not just for the sex.


Can you see yourself coming home to either of them?

Let’s say you come home to Mandy in a year or so, will you be able to be there for her and the kid?

Either way, you can’t have both women so you must pick one or none.

765,9b8p3u,False,None,7,After years of issues I've just been diagnosed with Schizophrenia. Here are my tips for dealing with the negative symptoms i.e. depression and lethargy.,depression_help,"I hope this is not patronising because each person's set of problems are, of course, complex and unique. Some things in life are difficult to control but there are many things you can control. I think the most important thing to do is to give yourself ambitions then make a plan to achieve them. Hopefully you'll find yourself dreaming about the future rather than ruminating about your problems. Here's what helped me:

Stop drinking completely. You may think you're only having a little every now and then but when your mind is not in great shape anyway, a little can have a big negative effect that lasts for days. Alcohol is of course, a depressant. Giving up completely may sound daunting especially considering how synonymous it is with socialising in Western cultures but there are now some good non-alcoholic alternatives available in shops and pubs. Alcohol free wine is still absolutely ghastly however. Try going at least a month without drinking. I expect the same goes for recreational drugs or gambling. I don't know much about those though.

Exercise as often as you can and eat healthily. The endorphins make you feel better, you'll get in shape and will get a sense of achievement form being able to run/swim/cycle etc faster and further. If you join a club you'll make some good friends too. Personally I think gyms are depressing as fuck unless perhaps you're there with a friend. Group classes are good though. Track your progress in a log to give yourself motivation. Go out even if it's raining. Once you've warmed up it's great.

Give yourself a project or ambition to work on. Immerse yourself in whatever you find interesting and find people who are interested in the same things even if it's just here on reddit. You might feel right now that you've lost interest in just about everything but there's probably something from your past that you could pick up again. Or it could be something totally new. Some examples: learn a new language, a musical instrument, making something, art, photography, reading, coding, maths, CAD. I hesitate to include gaming because a lot of games seem designed just to give instant gratification which I don't think helps much. I think longer term goals and a sense of achievement and pride are key here. Just pick something to work on and do it regularly. Share what you do with other people.

Minimise your social media use. There have been quite a few studies now that show a correlation between social media use and depression. Dial down the notification settings on your accounts and phone and relegate the apps to the last page. I'm not telling you to get rid of facebook completely because it has its uses but don't just endlessly scroll. Same goes for reddit. Try to keep your phone in your pocket unless necessary.

Find a few close friends you can confide in about how you feel. Therapists are good but expensive and time is limited with them. Good friends are better imo. Maybe some of them are having problems too. You could help them and feel good about it.

Get some quality sleep. Go to bed on time and don't allow distractions like your phone. If you have insomnia try having some ambient noise on in the background like white noise or recordings of waterfalls or thunderstorms. There's a ton of stuff like that on Spotify. You'll want a premium account though to get rid of the ads. There's also Sleep Radio. Also important is getting out of bed on time. Have a little routine. Get up, make your bed, have a shower, sing Feeling Good and don't give a shit who hears.

Recognise when you're ruminating and make yourself stop. This is hard. Sitting around thinking about how terrible everything is only makes the feelings worse. Don't feel guilty about it but do something to drag yourself out of that hole and break the cycle. Get up and do something. Do that thing you've been putting off doing. Clean the kitchen. If you're doing it in bed try thinking about what you want to achieve tomorrow.

Avoid shift work. It's really not good for you.

Get a pet. Or even just a plant. Look after it well.

Listen to music but avoid the genres and songs that just enforce negative emotions. If you get distracted by the lyrics easily then try instrumental music like classical or jazz.

Spend more time around nature.

Help other people with their problems. It's rewarding.

This last one is going to be very controversial: Make a small effort to be cheerful and friendly. Hopefully you'll find it rubs off on other people then they make you a bit happier too. Say good morning to the people you meet like the bus driver or the person behind the till. I'm not saying that you have to go around pretending that everything is fine but little things like asking 'how are you?' can help lift someone else's mood and in turn could lift yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9b8p3u/after_years_of_issues_ive_just_been_diagnosed/,49,This post is helping me pull myself out of the rut of negative thinking I’ve been doing for the night.

I think it's incredible that you had the courage to talk to others about it.

It's hard to tell it to myself but just because someone treated you like that it doesn't mean you're worthless.

Of course she immediately defends herself and says she has nothing to do with the way I'm feeling and how great of a mother she has always been and how she doesn't understand why I'd say I'm depressed.

Meanwhile my home life here with her is 80% of the cause of my depression. She used to be an awful alcoholic and smoker. She would get drunk every other night and sometimes I'd find her on the floor mumbling to herself completely out of her mind. You shouldn't have to go through that shit as a child. She threw me across the room one night just because I stepped in her way. 

She was never there for me, never understood the shit I was going through at home and at school, always made my issues about herself. Only just recently has she been paying the copay for my therapy as I can't afford it right now as freshman in college. 

It initially helped me cope with my shit, as I used to go once a week but I've been forced to go once every three weeks. Now I can't go at all because she's cancelling the card linked to the therapy because she doesn't feel like helping me anymore. I'm on the wrong medication for my depression and I need a psychiatrist, as my depression has only gotten worse in the past month or two of being on it and now I don't know what to do.

If I can't afford to go to therapy anymore and never be able to get that psychiatrist, my mental health will only severely decline from here and there's no telling what I might do to alleviate this pain. NONE of my family members are supportive. My dad doesn't give a shit, and neither does my sister. No one has any idea how serious this shit is except for my boyfriend, who is the only supportive and understanding person in my life.

785,bxz01s,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,28,Left work early today with every intention of hanging myself from the tree in my back yard...,depression_help,"And I pussied out...

I have no will or reason to live. I hate my job. I feel like I just live to work. Getting the company owner to pay his employees what he owes is a constant battle. He tries anything he can to fuck his employees out of their money. Even going so far as to threaten to take us to court for trying to challenge him, knowing that we can't afford it. I'm a sprinkler fitter apprentice and the entire company is basically run by apprentices. We have 3 journeymen out of about 20 people. One of those is a service guy, another is the superintendent. Only one journeymen actually works on jobs. It's illegal to have jobs run by apprentices, without a journeyman on site. Like two months ago the boss went off in a safety meeting about another employee being on a job by himself. Now, I'm on a job by myself with even less experience. He constantly bods jobs that we can't man so, we basically have one person per job at this point. 

I feel completely trapped. This is the only job experience I have. I've always found it extremely hard to get jobs because I have a really hard time with interviews. And it's hard to explain to people that I spent the first years of my adult life homeless and didn't get my first real job until I was 27. 

I rent a place with my dad. He got a DUI a while back and it's taking a lot of his money. I hate the place we live. I'm pretty much just confined to my room whenever I'm home. I can't get my own place because he won't be able to afford the place of I move out. Again, I feel completely trapped.

So, I went home early today. I have a rope that somebody gave me a while back that I tied into a noose. I stood at my back door for a good half hour, looking at the tree I want to hang myself from. But, I couldn't do it. Why? Because I'm too fucking scared of a couple minutes of pain leading up to my death. Or that somebody is going to see and try to talk me out of it. Or that I'll fuck it up and just end up permently disabling myself, but not dieing. Or what my dad's reaction would be when he comes home to see me hanging g over his fire pit. Even though when I first told him I wanted to kill myself, he said do it. So, I ended up laying down and fell asleep. Woke up to pouring ran and yet another reason to despise myself. I have no desire to live yet, I'm too much of a scared little bitch to go through with killing myself.

I have no real friends. I rarely get out. I'm a PC gamer. It's pretty much the only thing that distracts me from the fact that I despise being alive. So, everyone I talk to is online. Idk why I'm even posting this. I'm just gonna get the same generic bullshit replies that always come up when somebody mentions wanting to die but, here I am.

My friends don’t see me, they don’t understand, they aren’t there for me at all. Those that are there I feel like I’m reaching the point of annoyance with. I can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t focus on anything other than the way I’ve failed everyone around me. I’m trying so very very hard to hold on, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. I can’t see a positive end to any of this. I just want to disappear. I just need someone to care.

I don't know how much I can care for a random stranger when I don't even care if my family died (actually they're dead to me). But here I am, having time to spare, and you get it... The only thing that ever worked for me is to do self care, especially nutrition. Being unable to eat means that your adrenal glands (above your kidneys) got so damaged from stress (and lack of C, B and magnesium to handle it)... that it damaged your kidneys. When I get to that point, all I can eat is raw veggies. But the best is a bone broth soup with grounded veggies, meat and salad with fruits on the side. If I eat grains, sugar, corn, soy... it destabilizes my hormones and blood sugar, I get severely suicidal at some point... 

Give up people's expectations of you, don't keep up lie down and rest to preserve energy and resources. Depression is a burn out, from too much energy out and not enough nutrition in. You have to do the extreme opposite to restore balance. Total rest, force feeding yourself the most nutritious foods ever... then the body heal, we can function again... otherwise... scurvy symptoms causes extreme physical and mental exhaustion and suffering... lack of B causes psychosis, lack of magnesium give cramps, utter loneliness and the urge to die... those are the worst 3. Lack of D (sunshine) can cause depression too, any need that has been neglected or abused for so long that the reserves are all out. People can't help you, they are one more thing to handle... you have to focus on you and give your hardest to heal... which is to sit on your ass and stuff your face with REAL food. Not grains and artificial garbage. People can go to hell until you stop feeling like you're in it already. We can only share what we already have... and it,s not healthy to try to suck the joy out of someone while neglecting ourselves, so people shouldn't expect you to do that for them in your time of crisis either. It's ok to fail, to be imperfect, it's even ok to die. But if you want to live, then improve your self care and let go of all that slave brainwash about money and productivity that you've been fed by ads.

It’s a long story and I’m sure everyone reading this will think I’m weird.

So I think I’m probably gay but it’s been really weird and I’m not even sure. Years ago I started to feel that I don’t like my appearance and it almost feels like my brain or whatever desperately wants me to be in a different body, that is, the same gender as me of course. I always tell myself that it’s not okay but that’s not how really how your inner self work. 
The thing is, the change that I (for some reason) want is to get fat. It’s weird because I wasn’t really that skinny anyway. I always imagined as a kid that my soul was too big for my body, and I’m pretty sure as a teenager that’s definitely not the case.
I think about this more and more and it’s been bugging me for some time now. 
I have a friend who’s probably what that inner self (sorry idk what to call that inner voice that keeps bugging me) considers to be my ideal body. (I know it sounds creepy) I started to feel that I always wanted him to live better than me. 

**There is one thing to make clear: although I think I might be gay, I don’t necessarily “love” him, he’s just a good friend from my high school and we hang out a lot.**

He once broke his arm and, when I heard the news, I just snapped. I have broken my arm before and it wasn’t even that painful. But for some reason, that day when he broke his arm I feel so weird deeply that I don’t even know what that feeling is. I started to be very protective of him and it’s started to annoy him a bit. At first these thoughts seemed fine until recently when it started to drive me suicidal.
I get worried every time he goes to play basketball, skiing or whatever after that. It’s making anxious, and I can’t even tell him bc he will just think I’m weird and not believe in me. I know you would think none of this make sense, trust me, I think that too. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me and it’s just making me confused and terrified to face the future. It sure doesn’t sound serious but when you have to deal with these weird voices coming from nowhere, it’s a totally different story.
I just have to figure out a way to sort out this mess or it will likely keep bugging me until the day I finally decided to hang myself or whatever.

The school I started was full of racist rednecks and I had never been exposed to those type of people. This is pretty funny (and I can’t wait until the day where I’m not so depressed about it that I can laugh about it) but on my very first day, this girl in my science class told the whole class that “she heard the new girl bleaches her asshole” lmao I know completely random. Well I have a dry sense of humor so when people asked me if I did I would sarcastically say yes, and they told other people that they asked me and I said yes. So for the rest of the year I was called “butthole bleacher” and I haven’t shared this info with anyone bc I’m so embarrassed. This group of boys would always tell me how disgusting my body is and how I was shaped like a boy. I went home everyday crying because I had no idea people I didn’t even know could be so cruel. This one boy in particular would tell me to kill myself every.  single. day. He was not joking at all which made it worse. I had no friends (still don’t), was told how ugly I was everyday, and was now just known as a girl who bleaches her butthole (it’s ok to laugh at it, I know it’s funny for people who aren’t me) I remember one day in particular I was walking by a group of redecks and this guy goes “there’s the flatass who fucks everyone” . I was shocked and went into class crying. I was confused, I have still never even kissed anyone so I couldn’t understand where people were getting this information from. You may be thinking I’m over exaggerating but I’m not kidding when I say that everyday I was made fun of by mainly boys for being so skinny. The day I hit rock bottom was in dance class. I had just recently experienced a ton of problems at home and the constant bullying made my depression way worse. I had made no friends in the dance class and the time came for a group dance. I waited until the last group went in fear of being made fun of, and in front of the whole entire gym, the whole group as I began to approach them said “no, no, no we don’t want you” and the ENTIRE gym laughed. after dance class was last period where the mean boy was. He noticed I was sad and told me I should probably just kill myself. Everyone was taking about me on the bus ride home that day, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I took a rope, ladder, and my phone and climbed as high as I could up a tree in my yard. I was crying and playing my favorite song “American Pie”. Then I saw my dad pull into the drive way, and I couldn’t do it. Then, things began to turn around. I was excepted into the dual enrollment program at the community college, so for my entire junior and senior  year, I’ve been going to the community college full time and have not stepped foot into that school. I love physics so I decided to major in engineering, But, i got a D in calculus II last semester so I was kicked out of the program and since  I had all my credits for high school, I just began working full time at my job. I still have never had a boyfriend or even my first kiss. I’m so lonely and feel so ugly. Although now I’ve accepted the fact that I’m just not attracted to the opposite sex apparently. Anyways, I found out I actually had enough credit hours to get my AA before even graduating high school, so I got that last week. I’m just so depressed and I literally have no friends. Like I’m not exaggerating at all. None. I feel so lonely and embarrassed. Next week is high school graduation and today I had to go pick of my cap + gown from high school during the senior luncheon. As soon as I walked in all of the horrible memories came back and I got the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever had. I pulled myself together and got in the line to get the cap and gown. And then heard a group of boys saying my name and staring at me so I looked over and  a bunch of girls laughed. Then, the group forced a gap in line right where I was standing and said loudly “excuse me”, while the rest of the group laughed. I felt so humiliated. I have to actually walk with these assholes next Saturday and I’ve never wanted to not do anything more. I just want some friends that I can lean back on when shit like this happens but as aforementioned I have absolutely none. The only thing that keeps me going anymore is my hope that my future will be better. I got into University of Florida so I’ll be starting in the fall. I’m pretty excited for a fresh start even though it’s just an hour a way from where I live. But to be honest, I’m so sad right now and I’m back in a rut. I can’t eat, my mom has  to force me to shower or even brush my teeth. I don’t know what to do anymore. Thanks if you got this far.

Talk to the people at the suicide prevention hotline. They are often a local agency that the national hotline links you to to provide counseling and thereputic discussion in a time of crisis. I was not suicidal, but I called them and my anxiety was dissolved after 20 minutes of talking with the licensed professional. 
I am serious about this. If you need a person to talk to, go to them first to bring yourself back to a safely balanced place. Once you feel comfortable talking to the one person, call somebody you may have met at any point - your family who loves you; your teachers, professors, or boss; your buddy from high school; anyone you have the tiniest foundation of a relationship with.

I'm always saying I'm fine and that I'm okay. but I'm not. I'm very much not okay. every day my parents yell and bash me because I haven't been doing so well in school lately. I come from a very religious family and I've always been forced to go to church and pray, so basically it been shoved down my throat for years by my parents despite me telling them I didn't want to go. Many reasons stem from why I don't believe in the religion they want me to follow and basically its because I don't follow and I don't agree with their ideas and their way of treating each other. now I know this sounds off topic but let me get there. I am currently and have been for a while, struggling to find out who I am. sexuality wise and identity wise. What I've concluded is that I am a Bi-sexual male. though I can't openly express this to my parents because their beliefs think its ""wrong"" to be anything else but heterosexual. I feel like I'm going to be judged so much for just being...me. And being a male growing up to a father who some would call the typical man, held expectations on me as a male to me well...manly. and I've never been the super manly type and I can see and feel the disappointment in my dad's tone and attitude towards me. There's so much pressure on me being a male and coming from a family that is so judgmental towards ""different"" people. I feel like I'm being crushed by these expectations and pressure. My father never cared about me and only gets mad at my flaws and failures because it hurts his own self-image. he's admitted this many times. I would be crying and no one would bat an eye. I was crying in front of my father yelling at him ""I just want to be happy"" and he told me to suck it up and stop whining. I felt so pointless and hopeless. So unimportant to my dad.

All of this piled and piled on me and I would never show my feelings because again, it wasn't ""manly"" to show your feelings. I feel so trapped and crushed under these things. It would get to the point that I would cut myself just to feel something. I felt so numb and dead both inside and outside. I've made dates to kill myself but never followed through. I tried reaching out for help before but no one listened. My parents don't understand that someone could hate themselves or be this depressed. Whenever someone asks me if I'm okay or how I'm doing I always respond with I'm fine. I'm really not. At this point, I just want to be happy. nothing interests me anymore and nothing seems interesting. I can't do anything without thinking ""what's the point, why am I doing this. there's nothing that will pay off from doing this"". I feel so empty and alone. I push away friends and people I care about because I don't want them to see me and judge me for who I am. I feel hopeless. I feel like I'm drowning in this horror.

I can't go home, but being in this new place feels like death. I never seem to be able to make the right decision. My SO and my family love me, but I can feel my pain only making it more difficult for them. I love them so much and dont want to keep burdening the people who I care about most with my crippling depression. 
I have been to counseling, but because of a traumatic experience in my youth, placing myself in the dynamic of trusting someone when then proved to be not the safe place they were supposed to be, this is not really an option.

First things first. You've gotta distance yourself from this depression. It is NOT part of your character or part of your personality. Just like a zit isn't part of your character or personality. It's just something you are going through. It is something you are rightfully concerned about and talking about. So far so good.

Depression in of its own is not a disorder. It is the symptom of something usually deeper. You need to shop around for a therapist until you find one that you feel you can connect to. Might have to try out 3 or 5 different ones until you find that good one.

If you can't do things for the love of yourself, the second best thing to do is to do things for the love of others. For your fam.. for your SO.. but that will only exhaust you and carry you through for a certain distance, the next part is accepting and loving yourself.

This is what you need a therapist for. Helping you sort out your thoughts and find the source of depression and work on healing it. You cannot skip that step. And that step cannot be done without a therapist you CONNECT with. Start here. Don't stop till you found someone good. ",2020-01-22 03:52:50

Long story short been diagnosed with depression since 14. Cureently 29. GPs tried me on 8 different types of SSRIs in various dosages with and without benzos for anxiety. Been to many therapies and counselling sessions.
In 2014 i got really bad after the death of my nan who raised me. I was referred to a psychiatrist who i believe saved my life.
He rediagnosed me with unipolar treatment resistant depression with anxiety. He put me on a TCA called lofepramine at 240 mg a day. This is not what the pill is licensed for however he has found through his research thats when the medication works best. (Had a lot of gps having problems with prescribing me dosage because of it, even with a letter from him) it also has a short half life and as I was a suicide risk, it was the safest option.
Been on it for a while. This week he has prescribed me another TCA amitriptyline. I also am in weekly therapy (currently mindfulness)

Anyway, i just hate the fact i have to take pills. Everyone has their demons and one of mine is feeling weak for taking medication. And now i have to take another type. It makes me feel so shit, so incapable of functioning like a 'normal' human being. My self hatred is so high and I can't switch off the thoughts.

And don't get me wrong, I love technology, but I constantly am looking at the vast amount of time the younger generation is spending on it instead of being proactive in their lives. That in itself is depressing... It all becomes overwhelming when you stop to think about it, so that's why we get complacent.

I guess it’s not as important as everyone else’s stuff but I need to get it off my chest. 
 
Hi. My name is Rashaun. I’m 14 and I think I want to die.

I don’t feel like I should be here. Growing up all of my siblings had always told me that I was a mistake. That they didn’t love me, or that they didn’t want me around. I always thought it was normal.... but then I met him. My best friend.... At least I thought he was. 

His family was different. I realised this when his mum didn’t hit him like mine hit me. Or how he had a good relationship with his siblings. They were nice. And so I stayed. I was at their house almost every day. I’d beg to sleep overnight. I’d beg to just stay with them. This went on from the age of 7- 12... everything was good...But then I realised that I liked him.

 I liked him more than I should have and I knew that he’d think I was weird. He’d think I was a freak. But I told him anyway. I know I’m stupid but I really should have seen it coming that time. 

I wish I hadn’t told him. Maybe we’d still be friends. Maybe I’d have become ‘part of the family’ but no. I had to open my mouth and tell him in my stupid little voice that I was gay. Stupid me...why...no how could he ever love me?  I’m just a weird kid with no future.

Out of all of my siblings the one I envy the most is my older brother. He isn’t the oldest though. I’m one of nine kids. He’s number 4 and I’m number 5. Only 2 years apart in age. 

He is like me. We look the same, sound the same and even dress the same..... but everyone treats him like a saint. Meanwhile I’m shoved into a corner. A mere shadow of by brother, who is always reminding me who I could never be.

I started cutting at a young age.  I was 13 when he had finally noticed. And you know what he said... ‘do me a favour and cut deeper. ‘ ......yeh. Ok... I never did cut deeper. I’m such a scaredy-cat. 

I’d I could do it then I would. Die I mean. I read in a book once that  ‘people think the word scuicidal means that somebody wants to kill them self’s and they aren’t afraid to do it.  But it’s actually the opposite. They don’t want to die and they are scared...but they feel like there’s no other option‘.

I’ve thougt about it. Every now and then I get a random thought about jumping in front of a car on the way home from school. Of how when I’m in the bath I should drown myself. Or how I should hang myself with the rope I found in the woods and took home just in case. 

But I’m scared. And I don’t know what’s stopping me. That’s all. Even if you don’t reply. Thanks for reading I guess 

Yours sincerely

I may be a cynic and that's why but I do feel like, instead of helping, positive thinking makes me feel like an incompetent person, like I'm being talked down by the superior other that is going to come down to tell me the universal answers. It sounds like the one doing the positive talk is patronizing me. Is not that I'm the one who has ""low self esteem"", it definitely sounds like you are the one with ""superior complex"" and or humble brag. *""It's so easy to to be happy, just do what I do, it worked wonders for me, how can you not be happy with what you have? I care about you, you are so strong (smiley face thumbs up  heart kitty)""*. Ugh... It's like baby talk. It's condescending.

I would prefer to talk without pink filters. Trying to think that *""everything will be ok""*, *""don't worry, you have people that loves you""*. No, it won't be ok, it will suck ass and i will have to confront it one way or another anyways and trying to color it doesn't help me prepare for it. I prefer to grab that sadness and anger and use it in a productive way instead of trying to cover my eyes and go to my happy place ignoring and avoiding everything that I cannot change thinking that tomorrow will be a happier day, watching the beauty of the world around me. That only works so much and doesn't solve anything. 

Sometimes saying ""you know what, yeah, it fucking sucks and there might not be a solution to it"" it's much better because I can stop focusing on it and start trying other things. Sometimes a smack on the face on someone that is being a dick to you is what is needed to stop certain situations. Let me lash out at the world and let others know that something might be wrong with it and it won't get better unless it changes too.

I would prefer not avoid not to hurt the other with my words or my supposed toxic behavior because I can't see the bright side, censoring myself and what I actually think every five minutes to try to keep things going and make the other not feel offended.

850,bh8ii4,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,24,Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation?,depression_help," Hey, before depression took over my life I\[23F\] used to be such a happy person - joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isn't a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.

At first I thought it's only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldn't enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. That's when I realized that ""bad phase"" was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was ""this is almost acceptable"".

After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasn't even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation (along with sleeping) and because I knew that's what I'm supposed to do when I get fired but I didn't really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment.

But I feel like **this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete**. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I can't sustain that, like the old-happy-me is visiting sometimes but she doesn't wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now (great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship) I am mostly anxious and scared. I can't be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like ""you'll never go back to what you used to be before depression"", ""depression leaves a scar you'll have to live with your entire life"", ""depression is a part of growing up, you just can't go back"". I am starting to believe these things and it's sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bh8ii4/complete_recovery_after_depression_is_a_realistic/,42,"Here is the thing about depression (in my view.

Its hard only living in the past and hoping for a better future, you are never able to enjoy the present moment. But there is light. I have questions though. You said you had a psychiatrist did they tell you that it was safe to get off the meds? Or did you get off them on your own? Sometimes when we start to feel better we  stop taking our meds and it may seem like the right thing to do , but a lot of the times we feel better because the meds are starting to work and it may be a good idea to stay on them.

While I am proud of myself, I don't feel as good as I thought I would. I didn't expect my depression/anxiety to be magically lifted, but I did expect it to get slighter better. Honestly, it's gotten much worse. After graduating with a degree I wasn't 100% sure of and an unfavorable internship in my area of study I feel hopeless (I have a part-time job, but it's certainly not my career path and is unreliable due to the pandemic). I feel I have no career path and that I'll be stuck in this cycle forever.

I don't know my direction in life and I don't even know how to find one. I can't picture myself happily in any career path. Even job searching online causes immense panic attacks. The thought of interviewing for a job makes me physically ill. 

My friends (most of whom graduated on time years before me) have already started their careers and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud...unable to lift my feet off the ground. It takes a lot for me to get out of bed and I feel my family is disappointed in me. I fear my friends think I'm lazy and unmotivated but I'd feel silly telling them how I feel at this moment. It's gotten to the point where I avoid dating (pre-pandemic, I have been following social distancing guidelines) because I feel like a failure when I tell people I don't know what I want to do. I even avoid talking to family members because I dread the career questions and I feel it's strained some of my relationships.

Last summer she broke up with me over because she wanted to experience other things which she didn't come up front and said that I just figured. It was an extremely rough month for me after that but slowly got over it. Few months later Over the holidays she decides to try and come back into my life. I tried not to sleep with her for a bit since I knew that's what she wanted at first. Now we're back together but I found out that she slept with what was a close friend over the break up. She also was dating someone off tinder for majority of the break up and all of this is just really fucking me up. I really love this girl and I am trying to move forward since she claims that she loves me and wants to have a future with me. I want all of that as well, it's only been a month since we're trying to work things out again but there are days like these where I don't know if I could let this go. I want to so bad and recently I've been losing myself over this whole situation. I don't know who I am anymore. I feel so many emotions when I get caught up thinking about all the shit she did during the break up. Anyone have any suggestions or advice on this? Please. All is appreciated.

I say this with respect. I can tell by how you responded that you simply can’t get a clear focus on this. You need to talk with a dispassionate trained third party.  And I KNOW that is not what you want to hear.  But I’ve had a good therapist a time or two in my life and it can give you much needed clarity so you can move forward, with it without her. 

And yeah, that line you read about the other guy is going to fuck with your head, BUT if that guy was what she wanted she’d be with him.  
My big fear for you is that you are her safe zone. She went out, had some fun, liked this and not that, felt insecure, and went back to you.  If that’s the case, she’s going to meet the guy she perceives as “Mr. Wonderful” one day and she’ll bail again and leave you with more psychological torment while she’s having the time of her life.  Granted, that is just a possibility, but you can’t tell me that idea never crossed your mind. 
Bottom line: if your anxiety is dominating your relationship, it’s not working. If you’re working hard to fix your anxiety so you can be with her, you are doing a hell of a lot of work to fix a problem she created. And if she can’t work with you, really work and communicate, not just “hey, no big deal, we were on a break, drop it, it’s in the past” if she can’t actively work to help you heal, then she’s only in it for her.

I'm so proud of them, and I feel so selfish feeling this way, but at the same time seeing how ecstatic and joyful their family is and seeing them get their degrees just reminds me I was never good enough to make it to the end like them. Even if I did graduate, no one from my family would probably have gone. My own parents have never told me they were ever proud of me growing up, not once. If anything they only reminded me of my failures.

The majority of my depression is caused from growing up in extreme poverty and an unstable household with brothers abusing drugs, abusive parents, neglect, and childhood trauma. I went to a private University and none of my friends or anyone I knew even remotely experienced anything like that. 

Sometimes I get frustrated that a big reason why I couldn't graduate was because of the baggage and instability from my childhood that more privileged people graduating at my school didn't have to deal with. But I guess that's just life, it's not fair.

Honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though I have friends, they are not really people who I can depend on.

I've been there numerous times and I know how challenging and frustrating it is.

I suggest you give Habitica a try. I was super exited when I found it because I always thought a gamified app for self improvement would be the best.

You can add small things you could do, like walking for 10 minutes, wash a load of clothes, reading for a bit, drawin or writing (find actions that will make you feel productive, they can be related to your health, improving your skills, anything that will be a step forward). Doesn't matter if it's just for 5 minutes, any small action counts. You can also add habits, even the smallest ones like brushing your teeth, stretching, getting out of bed in time, doing your bed. Apart from this, add some rewards like eating some chocolate, watching a movie (again, find a couple of things you enjoy doing). For each reward, you set up a number of coins you have to pay and you raise those coins by checking up the habits and to dos. 

I find it motivating. I just add all the things I want to do in there when they pop in my mind and, if I crave some chocolate for example (which is 50 coins for me), I go look over the to dos and habits and see what I can do to earn some coins to ""pay"" for the chocolate. 

You don't have to put on yourself the pressure to do all of them, just aim to do something each day. I think it is important you add trivial habits in there too. If you have days when you can't get yourself to do tasks you consider more challenging, checking at least those easy habits will give you a sense of accomplishment. 

I still struggle getting started working on projects, but at least I manage to do small things to take care of my body and mind and I slowly work my way up. If there's one thing I learned fighting depression and lack of motivation is that the best way to deal with it is accept it and stop putting too much pressure on myself. Trying to become a productive and motivated person quickly is not working and was doing me more harm because I couldn't do it and felt even more dissapointed in myself with each try. Lowering my expectations and taking little steps each day, even if it's just stretching for 5 minutes and brushing my teeth, changed things for the good. I feel accomplished because each day I do more than I used to.

Yoga with Adriene also made me be more conscious about my body and it has been great for my mental health, hence improving all aspects of my life. I started the 30 days challenge for beginners. I'm at day 26 now and it will probablly be the first thing I actually finish. And most of the days I didn't felt like doing it, but I pushed through it thinking ""Well, 20-30 minutes won't kill me and my body will certainly feel better afterwards, it can't get worst that it already is"". You'll notice the improvements every day, that's what made me stick to it cause I need instant gratification. 

I hope this will help you. Wish you the best, you are not alone 🤗 ",2019-03-26 22:11:57

871,foasl6,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,8,I’m lonely and depressed,depression_help,"So I was off on a youth volunteer program, located across the country.  We would have been traveling to a second place, which didn’t happen.  I was in a house with 10 youth from around Canada, who started off as strangers.  We were living together for 2 1/2 months before we were sent home, which was halfway through the programme.

I met some of my best friends.  We have plans in over a year to do a road trip across the country.  But I won’t see them until then, as we live so far apart from each other.  I loved the time we all had together.  There were ups and downs, but I got a lot from the experience.  I’m generally quite shy, so it was amazing to be surrounded by people, socializing 24/7.  I definitely came out of my shell.  We would stay up late, and all sleep in the same room.  We would wake up, and have breakfast together.  Anytime I felt like going out for a walk, I always had friends around to join me.  We smoked weed many nights together, watched movies, and made food late at night.  It was what I always felt like I was missing, not having any siblings who I had this relationship with.  Anytime I was feeling a bit off, my friends were there to talk to me about it.

Also, I was independent.  I could do what I wanted and be who I wanted to be.  I wasn’t being told by my parents how to behave, or being judged by a group of friends from home who I act a certain way around.  I came into the programme as myself, and only myself.  I didn’t have to act a certain way to fit in with a group of friends, or act a certain way at home to please my parents.  Don’t get me wrong, I love my parents.  But I’m at the time of my life (17M, btw) where I want that freedom.  I want to explore who I can be.

We were supposed to travel other places, and fly to a different part of the country to spend the second half of the trip.  Then we got quarantined.  Then we were sent home.  My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before.  We had to leave at 3:30, so we didn’t bother sleeping before we went to the airport.  These edibles hit HARD.  Once I got to the gate we’d be waiting at, I was paranoid.  There was people around.  These people might have COVID-19.  The seat I’m sitting on might have COVID-19.  I couldn’t escape it.  It was everywhere.  Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon.  But I was trapped in this airport and couldn’t avoid it.  I had a mini-panic attack in the washroom.  

I got on the flight, and it was surreal.  I hasn’t really processed things yet.  But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around.  Then I woke up.  And the whole world came rushing into me.  I was on a flight.  I was leaving.  I was going home.  I might not see some of those people ever again.  My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldn’t change that.  I wanted to cry.  It’s not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group.  But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them.  And it was hard to leave that behind.

After a blurry ~14 hours, I finally got to my home airport.  My parents met me there and picked me up.  I told them how things went, but it’s impossible to really communicate my experience.  I got home, but realized I wasn’t really home.  Things were different.  Society has morphed into a nightmare-like dystopia.  I’m not even allowed to see all my friends.  How has the world changed so quickly?

I was able to go out and see two of my friends.  We played basketball, and it was pretty fun.  I told them about how my trip was, and shared a few stories.  But it was weird.  These used to be who “my friends” were.  They’re still some of my best friends, of course, but now I have OTHER friends, who I consider to be almost as close.  And with these other friends, I have plans in the future to go on a road trip across the country with.  It’s weird knowing that I know have other close friends, who my best friends don’t even know.  And it was weird coming back home, seeing my friends, and knowing that I don’t even want to be here.  I want to be back with my youth volunteer group.  My friends were really happy I was back, but I can’t possibly feel the same way under these circumstances.  I’m NOT happy to be back.  I don’t WANT to be here.  My life is so depressing now.

Almost every moment since I’ve been back, I’ve felt like I’ve suffered.  Sometimes, for brief moments, something has made me feel happy.  And I’ve felt content for that moment.  But then I remember my current situation, and it feels like a pang to my stomach.  I feel like I can’t escape this world of misery.  I know that COVID-19 will blow over, I’ll have a good summer with my friends here.  And next year, I’ll go on a road trip with my good friends from the programme.  But right now I just feel empty.

 I won't be able to help you exactly like a professional, but here are some stuff that actually helped me.

**1-** You need to love yourself first. So, find techniques that would increase your self-esteem. 

**Self-care** : each day put some routine that you love doing, like a mask, a bath, listening to music, singing, dancing . Just be kind to yourself :). 

**Talk positively to yourself**, as if you are talking to your future baby \*\_\* . Whenever you suprise yourself with some naughty negative thoughts, tell yourself ''HEY THAT'S NOT TRUE, "" and counter attack. Make this a reflex! That helped mee sooo much. I know that at the beginning, it wouldn't feel sincere ... but at some point I genuinly thought positively. Fake it 'til you make it ;). Tell yourself that you are beautiful, compliment yourself every day before sleeping and when you wake up. It helps when you do it before a mirror with the famous ''power pose'' :)

Surrounder yourself with positivity. Wallpapers, pictures, podcasts, inspirationa

**2-** **Keep up a journal**, it helps when you write down what you feel. When I do it, it calms me down. And when you name your emotions, you aknowledge them. and then write some potential solutions to your problems. You can also talk about them to your boyfriend if you feel confortable enough, but sometimes you just don't feel like talking to anyone, so it's better to write it down , with all your privacy.

**3-** Just don't pressure yourself to feel better instantly. Take your healing slowly. No rush. Break every emotion and problem into pieces , and u can ***tackle them down one at a time.*** Never think about several problems at the time.  **No stress allowed** :) . **You can't change overnight and that's okay.**

I knew when we met that she struggled with anxiety and depression, but it always seemed to be circumstantial most of the time. She would have her episodes, but would always seem to turn it around. When these times got dark, I was always there with her to reassure her that she wasn’t alone and that no matter how low she got, I’d be right there with her when she needed me. 

I also deal with my own depression and troubles, but always tried to be there for her and to be her rock, because her situation always seemed to be more important than whatever I had to deal with. In short, I sucked it up and put on a brave face to be there for her. It killed me on the inside, but when you love someone you tend to put their needs ahead of your own. 

Fast forward 3yrs and we are now married and have a beautiful, spirited 2 1/2yr old daughter. She is very successful at work and maintains friendships, but at the same time is in a very dark place. Nothing seems to make her happy any more. She is losing patience with our daughter more often, has negative perspectives towards anything, and is just plain sad all the time. She is constantly getting upset over little things that should be dismissed and directing blame on me and our daughter for a lot of her emotions. 

We have so much to be grateful for. Despite that, it’s always a struggle to feel it because of the negativity cast within our household.

879,bco6fa,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,26,Just need to talk to anyone,depression_help,"So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I’m gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I’m typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. 

Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I’m playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I’m going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  

I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. 

While we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. 

I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. Now he has gone to bed and I’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. 

I just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can’t call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I’m a mess.

888,aes0nl,False,STORY,10,Something I wrote and thought some of you could relate maybe,depression_help,"Depression is more than a dark cloud following you around. It’s pain, it’s sadness, it’s weight on your shoulders, it’s guilt, it’s frustration, it’s a lack of feeling like you’re enough, it’s an assumption that you’ve made about yourself that you’re not worth a *damn thing*. You look in the mirror and you might as well have the word mistake written on your forehead in permanent marker. You go through moments where you feel everything at once and then other moments where you feel nothing at all. You have reasons screaming at you to leave it all behind but your voice of reason is shouting *“no!”* in the far distance. Dreams remind you of the pain that your mind can’t forget, which naturally means you never get to escape. When you’re awake you cry and as the tears hit your cheek, they instantly shatter your sanity. In your dreams you may *scream* yourself awake. The feeling of sadness seems to creep into your fingers and toes, making it impossible to pick up the phone and ask for help, or walk into a place where you may find hope. The voice you have is no longer yours, it almost seems as if you are listening to another person speak, yet its your lips moving. *There would be less hurt if I wasn’t here. There would be less worrying on others if I weren’t here. There would be less…* Your mind even is too tired to finish the sentence. *You will be ok.* They tell me but it’s easier said then done because they don’t feel this.. *I have lost everything.

And whereas I understand my parents' frustration that I haven't been doing anything for almost a year now, I can't take their rants at me anymore. I have not chosen for my life to be like this at only 21 years old. 

Anyway, perhaps I *am* to stubborn and lazy? Because I got used to it? My parents tell me I can't keep living like this till my 80th, and they're also not going to let me stay in the house for that long. It's not like they would kick me out very soon though, as my older sister moved out at 25 years old. Anyway, whereas I haven't been feeling miserable and really depressed for some months now, I still feel unhappy and I do get frustrated because I don't find purpose in my life. I still can't find hobbies or passions that I truly enjoy. I don't really have dreams either. And because of the fact I don't have much that makes me enjoy life, I don't feel like looking for a job because I know that won't make me appreciate life more. It would probably do the opposite instead.

I do feel a little bad about it, because it's kind of ""obliged"" to work, at least at some point. Everyone needs to work. Otherwise you can't make money, and without money you die. But I guess guilt is the major reason for me to feel bad for it. But the other part of me still thinks I haven't chosen to have been born or become depressed, and therefore I feel like it isn't fair that I owe society something.

For many many years I’ve been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think “oh I don’t look too bad” and sometimes I think “oh god I can’t go out I’m so ugly”. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? I’m not sure because I can’t self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 1-2 times a day and limiting my calories. And I’m not sure if that’s extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. I’m scared to go to the extreme and go underweight (I’m close to being it) because I have a deadly disease and could die if I’m not eating properly. And I’m not too educated on ED’s so I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic. Back to my “depression”, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they don’t want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that I’m ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe I’m all those things they’ve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best I’ve ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I don’t exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasn’t good enough, or I was too ugly that she didn’t want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that I’m so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group I’m really close with is that we have “therapy” sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. I’ve yet to have my “session” yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I can’t say cause I haven’t been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... That’s probably because I haven’t told them all this, and I would’ve but I’m afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what I’m feeling isn’t serious and they think bad of me. And I’m scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine I’m floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and I’ve always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I don’t think I would because it’s a sin in my religion, but maybe one day I’m too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, I’ve made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares.

And on top of that my father started...acting worse....he used to be so nice but I think the stress of my sister (they knew she had mental issues just not what she'd do) I think the stress kinda broke him... I felt like I'd lost my family around that time I was barely coping but then something worse happend.... my hands started going numb...I started having flashbacks...of a sort....dreams I was sleep walking...slowly but over a course of a few months I'd lost almost all feeling in my hands and started getting dizzy...my hands started hurting and I started getting sick more often...and every time I'd get sick my whole body would go numb...not even figureitivly my body REALLY was going numb... soon things became progressively worse and my parents took. Me to doctors  after doctors....they all did tons of tests on me but couldn't pinpoint anything...in the end they ended up just saying  welp we dunno but I guess you'll end up calling it fiber myalgia... a while after that my condition had worsened so much I decided to quit ice skating...one of my favorite sports because it was to painful for me...and since I'm homeschooled that was one of the few places I had friends...I started losing touch with them... I was in and out of hospitals for a number of things...each one being mostly untreatable...my other sister (not the one who raped me) my other sister said I made my problems out to be bigger then they were...I found out that if I DIDN'T speak up about anything they'd worry and see just how much I had trouble...so I stopped talking I continued trying to handle everything myself I kept the thing that happend in my childhood a complete secret....no one knew... it was eating away at me...I had almost no friends I was  depressed  and in pain 24/7... my parents sensed I was depressed and they tried to tell me it was a ""side effect "" of my condition. Which made me feel as though they were saying my feelings weren't my feelingss...  it built up...then one day on my birthday my parents invited my eldest sister to the house.... when she arrived she was visibly pregnant...none of us had known... she  had all the attention on her the whole day and I kept worrying how she'd parent the child when she was so cold hearted...  she told me that day that she would no longer harm me...because when the baby arrived it would be her new play thing she said.... I felt sick               to the stomach it was my 14th birthday and that was the day I attempted to end my own life... I had left a letter explaining everything about my sister to my mother and other sister... I had left that letter knowing they'd save that little baby from my sister...then I let go and tried to die...I felt so sad..all my life I looked toward the future with bright eyes...and I had decided in one moment I couldn't continue farther....turns out my parents had invited one of my last  friends over to surprise me...he was the one that walked in and found me nearly dead...when my parents saw me I'll never forget how my mothers face looked or how uncaring my father looked. They rushed me to the hospital  and I obviously lived or I wouldn't be typing this..  I still feel depressed but really dont want to die...but I am having trouble finding a reason to live... my mother is the only one who ever found and read the letter so she and I talked about my sister...my mother loves my sister very much and had a hard time with it...another reason why I didn't tell anyone... she just had no idea that was going on... my sister  dropped contact with my family and fell of the radar...I assume my mother had something to do with that... the baby? Well my sister had a miscarriage only a couple days ago...around the time she fell out of touch... I haven't pressed charges on my sister..I just can't get myself to do it... I know this is probably the lamest stuff to be depressed about but I honestly don't want to go to counseling where someone is PAID to care... I feel depressed like any other 14 yr old I guess.

907,fnhcmo,False,MOTIVATION,11,It gets better and I’m living proof :) you can do it,depression_help,"(TW: I include some old journal entries which include a lot of self hate/suicidal thoughts) 

The last couple years have been ROUGH. I’ve struggled with depression, ptsd, anxiety, and a whole array of other issues. I’ve been abused to the max in every category. I have known the deepest, darkest depths of pain possible for someone to go through. I went through a really rough time this year. 

To give an idea of where my headspace was at, Ive copies some old journal entries below. 

“I have tried all my life to make up for the worth I was born without. All of it has been in vain. Worth is something intrinsic not earned. Shit will always be shit no matter how much you dress it up. That’s what I am - a worthless piece of shit.” 

“I am in so much pain and I am so tired all the time. I can’t sleep, my body won’t let me eat, my mind won’t let me rest, my soul is too broken to be repaired and it’s becoming more and more painfully obvious every day.” 

“I just want to be loved. I know I’m not good enough to be loved, but my heart breaks and longs to know what it’s like to be whole and to be wanted. I desperately want to be loved.” 

“Nothing keeps the pain at bay anymore. I used to be able to drink or smoke it away but now I can still feel it. It’s presence is dulled but there nonetheless. It’s like my lungs can never get enough air, never enough of my soul can escape the pit inside me to start actually living. Why the fuck am I here. Why the fuck am I alive.” 

These are just a couple of the many, many entries I have. I hated myself and was SO depressed. There were so many days I couldn’t get out of bed or even convince myself to eat. It was hard and there were so many days I just wanted to give up. But I didn’t. And I am so thankful I kept going. 

Now, I am celebrating my first anniversary with the love of my life. I have amazing friends i adore. I am about to graduate college with honors. I absolutely adore my soon to be in law family. I have adorable pets. I am genuinely happy. I actually love and like myself. I’m excited for tomorrow and actually want to be alive! Honestly, life is pretty great right now. Not that it doesn’t have its challenges, but it’s so worth it. 

My life is unrecognizable when I compare it to the season I was in when I wrote those things in my journal. It has been hard. I have done a lot of work in counseling and on my own. For a while every day was a struggle. But now, it’s not. The days are getting easier, my depression has gotten further and further away, I have genuine and contagious hope. I made it out and hot dog I fucking LOVE life. 

If you’re reading this and you need some encouragement today, please take my story as proof that anyone can overcome this. I know it’s hard, especially with so many people in isolation and in quarantine. But I promise it’s worth it to keep going. You have no idea how good life can be on the other side unless you give it a chance. Your life and your future are worth fighting for. You are strong, you are an overcomer and you can do this. 

I believe in you and I am proud of you for making it this far :) I hope my story can serve as encouragement for somebody who might need it. I really do promise it’s worth it. The fight is hard, but keep fighting. The victory is well worth the effort.

908,dpb02k,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,15,I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation.,depression_help,"*(tl;dr at the bottom)*

Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. But it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  
He isn't someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of ""I don't know"".  
So I thought I'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (Of course I know that you can just make guesses but I'm trying really hard to understand him and I'm just so confused.)  
We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldn't say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. That's why we're not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks I'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (Which I think is true and at the same time isn't... It's definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where I would like my relationship to be.)  
That was two months ago. We're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. We're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   
I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   
He said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  
I don't know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and I can't take this much longer.   
I know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that I'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, I've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of ""just a friend"".

And now, I'm still here because I've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. I'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.

So... I'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly I'm looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this.  
Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dpb02k/i_think_my_boyfriend_left_me_due_to_his/,35,"Not the same situation but I met someone who has depression.

910,b5npuz,False,STORY,3,LOVE,depression_help,"I think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing.

To love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated.

One would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive.

In reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it. 

In the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love.

Love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of “being in love,” this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love.

Many of us do not know what love is… little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or “being in love,” as sex,  as enmeshment or even as codependency… but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love.

Then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically… the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is.

Love is like a multifaceted diamond. As a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent,  reliable… it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable… it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better.

This is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced. 

For too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant… and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security… when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused.

In this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved… as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could… on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love… we didn't know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it… if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them.

For many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us… being truthful was not as important as being safe. Being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse.

In our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love… our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. So we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry.

As children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. These influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though “being in love” is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth.

Little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime…

For many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how… a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain.

One of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response… however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored… this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs.

That is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities. 

As if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. Typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. Why? Our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain… we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. Therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. Why? Because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty…. All of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger.

What our subconscious associates with safety is certainty… so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front… all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe… we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. Usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. These people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were… attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies.

One of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong… you've never experienced love or given love…. You've only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or “being in love,” none of which on it's own is true love.

To fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. The challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. Unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories… so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. Here is an example from my own life:

As a young adult, I knew I hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. This I knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. It wasn't until my 40s that I realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. As a baby, I didn't like porridge, so like most babies I spat it out… this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out… when I learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that I would hurry up and swallow so I could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. Sad story… but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge… this is my earliest memory of subjugation… the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do… subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. It also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. It also contributed to enmeshment where I quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as I was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. Here is another example from my childhood:

I can't remember why, but I remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6… I was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed… as most 6 year olds would do I cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing… as an adult looking back I think this made my mum feel bad… she didn't like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much… another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that I will get punished for feeling sorry for myself… in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and I should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate.

For me personally, this has been my experience… my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self… this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency… all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and anxiety.

It is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good… and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good.

So how the hell do we undo this?

Not easily and not quickly… it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments.

To undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. As a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum… but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse… our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response.

Now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. In order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. For me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected… this pain I was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. Knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, I meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie… it's not and never was a true representation of love… I meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents… then I let myself get angry… at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods… I got angry at the injustice of life itself… I started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off… I listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as Leo Morachioli “Killing in the Name of” and “Give it Away” and “Sabotage.” In all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean… they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it.

Of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs… the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be… but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from.

From that point on, you can start fresh… you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. You can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you… because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world won't care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say.

You simply cannot love others if you don't love yourself. If you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem,  what possible love do you have left to give away to others? On a basic level you don't even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone… so you can't show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself… this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. Only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others… you cannot do this from a place of emptiness.

Even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need… however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/b5npuz/love/,38,This is an excellent post.

I feel I'm pretending I don't see this dark monster looming over me everytime I say I'm getting better. I'm on antidepressants and they help but it feels I'm going to take them forever. I tell myself I'm more social now! But I know for a fact I only talk to two friends and more often than not ignore them when they want to hang out. I feel like I care about my appearance now, but I'm heavier than ever. I feel like I care about my future but I keep missing classes because I simply cannot find the will to go. I want to have a relationship but everytime someone interested approaches me, I panic that they'll know there's something wrong with me and leave me.

I'm usually very bubbly and positive on my daily life but when I stay quiet for a moment, I feel as if I have this mask that threatens to fall off and show everyone how I really am.
At night I refuse to aknowledge my intrusive thoughts so I fall asleep while reading, listening to music or watching videos. Am I avoiding reality? Is it a good coping technique? What is it?

I just can't trust my own thoughts because they were the ones that led me here so I never know if I'm taking the necessary steps towards recovery and this is a normal setback or if I'm lying to myself and pretending everything's getting better  because I can't deal with the fact I'm never going to get out of this hellhole.

I’ve been healthy for 4 years before that, but it’s been too much lately.

There were, of course, a lot of good things. I feel like I’m finally getting out of an artistic stasis and ditching drugs for good, therapy and meditation are helping lots, I kinda made up with the friend and had many great moments with other friends, and had a blast at a summer music festival. Although, you know how it is - depression makes you focused on negative stuff specifically. Every day I do my best to get just a little peace of mind, but it feels like a Sisyphus’ task. There is always a scary tiny voice that’s telling me I don’t really deserve all of that self-care, showering and stuff, not jumping under buses, things like that. Turns out, it’s possible to be ungrateful and distrustful towards your own self.
The best thing that’s happening right now is that I’m finally getting the courage to tell my story (mainly, writing shitty poetry and showing it to friends. Or anonymous Reddit posts).

Depression: An Extremely Practical Guide to Making It Through Your Depressive Episode 

So ages ago I came across an awesome guide to dealing with a depressive episode, which helped me immensely. I have been searching high and low for it to share, but I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere. If these tips ring a bell for anyone and they can get me the original to share, or you know the author, please let me know. 

In the meantime, here is my very practical guide to dealing with a depressive episode, based on what I pulled and use from that article as well as my own experience. 

[Note: I’m not a medical professional or a therapist or anything. These will not work for everyone. This is just a compiled list of things I have found useful, people I know have found useful, or I have read from other writers.]

Including: 
-The Very Basic Basics 
-Food 
-Personal Hygiene 
-Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross 
-Asking for Help 
-Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time 

**The Very Basic Basics**

1)Don’t Die 
It sort of goes without saying, but the end goal of dealing with a depressive episode is to make it through. So as long as you are still alive, good job! If you start thinking seriously about suicide, reach out and get help ASAP. Tell a trusted friend or family member, call a suicide hotline, or call emergency services (911 in America) or go to your nearest emergency room. 

2) Bare Minimums 
Moving forward from that, it's a good idea to lay out what the bare minimum for your day-in-the-life of a depressive episode. And I mean the absolute bare minimum. The more things you feel like you need to do, the harder it is to get up and do any of them, so make a very short list to start off. Once you are started on that list, often it's easier to continue with the momentum, but start small. 

For example, my list is:
Get out of bed at least once 
Take meds/vitamin 
Fill water bottle to drink throughout the day 
Eat at least one (1) thing
Do one “Have To” and one “Like To” (see next point) 

Theres plenty of other things I shoot to do, like showering and teeth brushing and eating more than just A Thing, but absolute worst come to worst, that's my very basic basics. 

3) Have To’s and Like To’s 
Try, everyday, to do one thing you have to do, and one thing you like to do. This is good because it shows you that, no matter how slowly you are moving, you are not stagnant. You are moving through this depressive episode. 

Make your Have To’s and Like To’s  proportional to your energy that day. On an okay day your Have To might be a load of laundry and your Like To might be a long walk. On a bad day your Have To might be wash one fork and your Like To might be to watch a funny youtube video. Baby steps. 

Don’t worry if you are not actually enjoying your Like To. Depression can kill your ability to enjoy anything, and that's okay, just do something you know you usually like. It will help you notice when you are starting to come out of the episode to see yourself begin to enjoy the things you usually do. 

At the end of the day, as long as you are alive and doing at least what you need to to keep that up, good job! 


**Food**

So in terms of food, the name of the game is to eat some. To do that when you barely have the energy to stand up or put on pants, you are going to want food that is as easy to make as possible. Also think about adding a multivitamin to your daily routine to help with the vitamin deficiencies your less-than-perfect depression diet probably has. 

[Note: I'm not a nutritionist. Note #2: I’m super white and all my examples are going to be pretty boring white-guy foods, because that's what I eat while depressed. Please take the general concepts listed here and modify to better foods if you can think of them]

Buy stuff in advance 
You probably don’t want to go shopping when you’re depressed. So sometime between episodes, stock up on things you can buy in advance and store until they are needed, like canned and frozen food. I’m not going to make a big list because it varies based on what you like, but whatever it is make sure it's food you at least enjoy regularly. Depression makes most things taste terrible, but if you like it usually it will be slightly easier to stomach. Bonus points for things with more than one major food group in one. Think things like:

Hearty soups/stews with protein and grains
Chef Boyardee or other kids pasta that contains a full veggie serving
Frozen Tv dinners that have a protein, veggie, and grain 
 
Whatever it is, you basically want stuff with instructions that read something along the lines of “Open, Microwave, Eat.” 

It’s also a good call to have some stuff in your cabinet that involve cooking, but that are easy and reheat well (see point 3). 

2) Grocery Shopping 
If your episodes are long, then at some point you are going to need to go buy some food (or ask a friend to get some for you, see: Asking For Help). There’s nothing worse than gathering all the energy to go to the grocery store, getting overwhelmed, and ending up coming home with just a box of cereal and a block of cheese, so again, prep a list before the episode hits. 

This is your chance to get the things that you can’t store in advance but that will still be easy to eat. Again, you want to get things that you like, and that require little to no effort to prepare. 

Stock your fridge with cold foods you can eat as they are. It depends on the things you like, but think along the lines of 
Yogurt 
Chicken or Tuna salad
Veggies you can eat raw (baby carrots are my fave) 
Hummus 
Cheese 
Sandwich meat 
Fruit (if you think you’ll eat it fast enough. Mine always ends up going bad) 
Milk (whole and soy have a bunch of protein) 
Pre-made sandwiches
Etc 

Also stock your pantry with easy to eat stuff like 
Bread (for sandwiches or toast with peanut butter or whatever) 
Crackers (for hummus/chicken or tuna salad/to put peanut butter on, or just to eat)
Cereal 
Snacks (See below) 

3) When you can cook, use that energy well 
If you have a day in a depressive episode when you have the energy to cook, or you have a friend over helping you, make sure you are ready to cook something that a) you like b) is still relatively easy to cook and c) you can make a bunch of and eat for awhile. 

As with the canned and frozen stuff, bonus points for things with multiple food groups all in one. Extra bonus points if it's something you can make in one pot/pan/dish. Think about these things in advance and have stuff on hand to cook. I always keep pasta (the hidden veggies kind!) and tomato sauce in my cupboard and some frozen ground turkey or beef for pasta with meat sauce. I know a lot of people who make great stir fry or curry with only a few ingredients that they can keep on hand. Whatever works for you. 

When I’m done cooking, I like leaving it all in one big tupperware, to have fewer things to clean (see: Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross) but I know other people prefer dividing it into meal-sized containers so they don’t have to worry about choosing serving sizes. 

4) Snacks! Make them useful 
Sometimes meals are tough. No worries, snacks are easier! But in choosing snacks, work towards ones that add up to the calorie and protein/vitamin content of a real meal. You are also probably going to eat some chocolate, which is totally cool, but think about adding something like 

Nuts/trail mix
Granola 
Protein/granola bars 
Beef Jerky
A giant spoonful of peanut butter (I know I’ve mentioned peanut butter a lot but it's so easy and good) 
Or other foods with similar benefits

5) Drinks 

DRINK WATER. As much as those “all you need to cure your depression is 8 glasses of water a day” posts are utter BS, water is extremely important and you need it to not die. Water bottles are easier to keep around than cups, so grab a water bottle you can keep on the couch/in your bed with you, and drink up. 

Whole milk and Soy milk both have a lot of protein per serving, and almond milk has a ton of vitamins. 

If you have a really hard time motivating yourself to eat, but there's a meal replacement/supplement you can drink, give it a go. Ensure or Carnation Instant Breakfast or something along those lines. If you find a protein powder that isn’t super gross, that's good too. Try not to rely too heavily on these, but they make a great addition to food. 

Drinks with a bunch of vitamins like v8 are a great addition as well. V8 also has a line of fruit and veggie drinks if you are like me and thing tomato juice itself is hella gross. 

Smoothies? I’m a big fan, but a whole blender can be a lot to clean for some people. I’m not talking crazy recipes with fresh kale and blueberries and 14 types of fish oil, but milk, a frozen banana, and chocolate chips is an easy, filling snack.

NO BOOZE. I know there's a temptation to drown sorrows in alcohol, but seriously it's a bad idea. Alcohol is a depressant on its own, and will probably make things worse. Also it will make you more dehydrated and whatnot. Just stay clear until you’re feeling better. 

And drink water. I said it before, but again, make sure you drink enough water. 


**Personal Hygiene**

OK so this one gets tricky, because I don’t want to be the one saying like, “meh, it's fine to bail on basic personal hygiene things” but when push comes to shove, if you can’t do 100%, it's good to have a compromise instead of doing 0%. So, a few points: 

1) Teeth:
If you only have the energy to brush once a day, make it right before bed.

Mouthwash is not as good as brushing your teeth, but it’s way easier, so in a pinch, grab some listerine, swish and spit. 

2) Showers 
Feeling gross will make you feel worse, so try to prioritize a shower of some  kind every other day or so, based on your energy level. 

You can compromise the amount of things you do in the shower to motivate yourself to get in. So instead of your 14-step shower routine with shampoo and conditioner and soap and that fancy exfoliating body wash, etc, tell yourself “I’m going to get in the shower, and I’m going to wash my armpits, and then I can just stare blankly at the floor until I run out of hot water.” Odds are, once you get in there and have the soap in hand, you’ll be able to keep the momentum going and wash the rest of you. If not, at least you don’t have stinky pits anymore, and that's cool too. 

Washing your hair is also a good thing, because it will overall make you feel less gross, but don’t let that become the tipping point that makes a shower too hard. Some people have found success with dry shampoo if that's easier. 

If you can’t manage a shower, have some baby wipes on hand that you can at least hit your pits with now and then. Again, these are awkward things to compromise on, but on your worst days anything is better than nothing. 

3) Face 
Baby wipes are also awesome for your face if you don’t have the energy to wash. 10/10 would recommend. 

4) Baby wipes in general 
Baby wipes are just in general great. Keep some in your bathroom for face/body washing, keep some by wherever you hole up when depressed (bed, couch, comfy chair) for wiping hands off after eating. Anything you need to be clean and you don’t have the energy to do in the traditional way, baby wipes can help. 

5) Have a routine 
If you have all your morning/evening bathroom stuff in a detailed routine usually, then it's easier to do it all on autopilot on your sort-of-okay depression days. Ie: always brush teeth first, then get in shower, wash hair first, then wash body, then wash face, then get out of shower, then dry off, then moisturize, etc. Autopilot is depressions friend, and also when your memory is iffy, it's easier to not have to think “Wait, did I brush my teeth before I got in the shower? Was that three days ago? Who knows.” 

5) Clothes 
Wearing the same sweatpants for 4 days in a row isn't great, but really not the end of the world, so don’t stress too much. Clean clothes can make you feel better though, so change when you have the energy. A good rule of thumb is to never put dirty clothes on a second time. If you have already taken an item of clothing off, as tempting as it is to just grab the same sweatpants off the floor after your shower, grab a fresh pair. You are already 75% of the way there. Grab clean underwear once a day when you go to the bathroom, and when you sit and your pants are down anyway, switch them out. 

If you start running out of clean clothes, laundry is usually pretty daunting, so thats a good time to pull in a favor from a friend (see: asking for help). 


Long story short, do as much as you can to keep clean, but don’t let being unable to keep up with your usual standards keep you from doing anything at all. Do what you can and consider anything you can manage a win.


**Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross**

The more gross your house is, the harder it seems to clean it and the more daunting that becomes. Also, embarrassment about a messy home can cause a lot of people to isolate because they don’t want people to come over, either just for company or to help. So, ideally, you want to keep a mess from getting too bad. So here’s some tips 

1) Trash
Don’t bother with trash cans. Ok hear me out on this one, trash cans are a nuisance. You’ve got to put a clean trash bag in, walk all the way over to the trash can to put stuff in, try not to overfill it, probably overfill it anyway, then have to really cram stuff in there to take the bag out, take the bag out, bring the bag to your dumpster/outdoor trash can, put a new bag in. That's way too much work. 
 
Instead, grab a bunch of plastic (or paper) grocery bags, and hang them on doorknobs around your home. Put one in the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, living room, ect. Make sure you also have one near wherever you hole up when depressed (bed/couch/chair). Just toss your trash in there when you exit a room, and it keeps trash in much more manageable amounts. When it’s full you can just tie it off and pop a new one on. Or if someone is coming over and you have the energy to straighten up, just walk around and grab all the bags. Done! 

2) Dishes 
Ain’t nobody got time for dishes. Piles of dishes around your kitchen make it harder to eat, which makes it harder to have energy. Buy yourself some paper plates/bowls and plastic forks and spoons and use those for easy cleanup. Seriously, it's a life-saver. I recommend buying some on clearance after a holiday, because it's not like these are for impressing anyone, what do you care if you’re eating out of a halloween bowl in June? When you are done, pop those suckers in your nearby trash bag and you’re good to go. 

If any of your easy-cooking stuff involves roasting/baking, consider also grabbing some oven-safe baking tins that can be thrown out after a use or two. 


3) Disinfectant wipes
If your episodes are long enough that it’s unreasonable to not do any cleaning through the whole thing, disinfectant wipes are a great way to clean things super fast. Just grab a Clorox wipe or whatever and give your kitchen/bathroom countertops a quick wipedown. Make sure you have these on hand before the episode kicks in, so it's one less thing to grab on your trips out of the house. 

4) Overall 
Overall, try your best but don’t worry. Nobody expects you to be dusting and vacuuming your house when you have the flu, no one (including you) should expect that when you're in a depressive episode. 

If you are going to give cleaning up a go, but have limited energy, try committing 5 minutes to cleaning the space closest to wherever you hole up, usually a coffee table or night stand. If you are going to have one space clean, it might as well be the space you probably spend the most time staring at.

 Ask for help before it gets too bad. It's easy to fall into a trap where your house gets really bad, and it's overwhelming to clean, but it's also so messy that you are embarrassed to have someone over, even a friend to help with the mess, which just exacerbates the problem. If it's getting pretty bad, but not embarrassingly bad yet, thats a good time to call a friend (see: getting help). Or even if it is embarrassingly bad, still ask for help. Again, you’re sick, it's okay to be a mess. 

**Asking for Help**

A strong support system is your best way to get through an episode. Having people you can rely on, emotionally and practically, can go a huge way towards helping you through the episode. 

1) Again, Don’t Die 
I’m going to say it again, above all else you want to make it through the episode. If you are seriously thinking of hurting yourself in any way, or are having thoughts of suicide, reach out IMMEDIATELY and get help by telling a trusted friend or family member, calling a suicide hotline, calling emergency services (911 in america) or going to your nearest ER. 

2) Explain your depression before an episode
Talk to the people who care about you about the fact that you have depression, and what a depressive episode looks like for you. If they give you the “yeah, okay, I get sad sometimes too” face, you might need to do some work to get them to understand how bad it can be and why you might need their help. If they give you the “Oh sh*t, that sucks so much for you that you have depression, I get that because I understand how bad depression can be” face, then they are a good person to ask for help. 

3) Ask for explicit, practical help from friends and family 

When you say you’re having an episode, a lot of people will say “aw, well let me know if there's anything I can do to help.” They say this because most people want to, but have no frigging clue how to help you. And it's true they can’t make you not depressed anymore, but they can help in practical ways. 

When you come across a task that needs to be done, but that you don’t have the energy for, its a good time to call a friend. They will likely be happy that they get to help you, because they love you and want to, and they will be happy to not have to worry or guess how to best do so. 

So ask for specific things. When they say “Is there anything I can do to help?” Say something like:

“Yeah, actually. I know it's kind of weird to ask, but my laundry is piling up and I need a hand with it. Any chance you could come over and help? We can watch a movie while it's in the washer.”
“Yeah, I really need to do dishes but I’m having a hard time motivating myself. Can you come over and give me a hand? I think I would do better at it with company.”
“Yeah, somehow being unable to get out of bed for 3 days has made my apartment gross and I don’t know where to start. Can you help?”
“Hey, I really need some food, but I’m having a hard time getting to the store. If I gave you a list, could you pick some things up for me? I’ll pay you back for them.” 

Its weirdly personal to ask for help with this sort of stuff, but your loved ones who say they are there to help are actually there to help, you just need to tell them how. 

Also, of course, use your own language when asking for help. Mine is a lot less formal and a lot more “Hey, one of you nerds should bring my depressed ass some chinese food.” But whatever works for you and your support system. 

4) Be specific in what you need socially 
In the same way you need practical needs met, it will also be helpful to you and your loved ones if you are explicit with what you need from them socially. 
. 
This is going to depend dramatically on how being around other people affects your depression. A lot of us tend towards isolation, and for some that's effective, but for others it helps more to be in the company of others. It’s okay to not be yourself or be the life of the party, so if you want company, say so. Again, be specific. You can ask a friend: 

“Hey, I need some company, but I don’t have energy to go anywhere or do anything. Want to come over and watch a movie while I lay on my couch?” 

Or, if it would be good to get out of the house, but you don’t have much energy, same thing:

“Hey, I still have way too much depression for doing things, but I need a change of scenery. Can I come lay on your couch while you do stuff?” 

If a group of friends invite you out to do something, and you’d like to even though you will be a wet blanket, tell them that. If you warn them, then you won't feel bad about not being yourself. You can say:

“I’d love to join, but I’m still dealing with a depressive episode, so I will probably just sit there. That okay?”

Or if a group of friends are going out/one friend wants to hang out, and you don’t want to, it can be good to let them know if they should keep inviting you places. Say something like 

I think my depression is still acting up too much to come out tonight. Thanks for inviting me, though. I appreciate knowing you still want me around, so please keep asking me even if I keep saying no. Eventually I’ll be able to say yes again. 
Or
I’m probably going to be too depressed to go out for a little while. I feel really bad that I have to keep saying no, so how about I tell you when I’m feeling better and we can start hanging out again. 

However BE CAREFUL when creating long-term distance from people. You need some people checking in on you, so it’s okay to isolate from acquaintances and casual friends who you don’t have the energy for, but make sure to have some close friends around.

5) Talking to casual acquaintances 
It's tricky to explain depression to people who don’t understand, so in the middle of an episode it takes a lot of unnecessary effort to explain it to casual acquaintances. People like coworkers, friends-of-friends, distant relatives you don’t like, etc aren’t owed that level of information about you if you don’t want to get into it. That is not to say depression is anything shameful or something you should hide. A lot of people feel empowered by being open about it, but personally I just find it inconvenient with that level of acquaintance. 

Everyone has their own tactic for explaining whats going on, so use whatever works for you. It's a good thing to think about in advance, so you are not suddenly caught off guard by a coworker asking why you’ve been so off lately. Whatever it is you want to say, know in advance how much and what you’d like to share. 

Since mental illnesses are illnesses, it's totally fair to refer to an episode as “being sick.” The conversation I use most frequently goes as follows.
 
You okay? You’ve seemed off lately.
Yeah, I’ve been sick. I’ll be fine. 
Oh no, do you have that [cold/stomach bug/allergies] that has been going around?
No, its part of like, a whole thing *gestures vaguely to all of me* It happens sometimes, but I’ll be okay. 
Oh okay, well I hope you feel better. 

That establishes that 1) yes, something is going on but 2) I clearly don't want to talk about it. 3) I’ll be fine so don't worry and 4) leave me alone. 

I use a variation of that explanation for calling out of work, canceling plans with acquaintances, explaining why I’m not super peppy at work, etc. 

Again, use whatever language and level of sharing you feel comfortable with, just think about it in advance. 

6)Getting professional help 
If you are at the point where a guide like this is necessary, you probably also need help from a pro. Nothing to be ashamed of; no one would expect you to beat cancer without the help of a doctor, no one should expect you to handle depression alone either. 

I'm not going to go into detail about how to find a doc, since it differs dramatically based on your insurance/money/location, but its important. Getting to a doc is a good task to call in a favor from a friend if you need. You might have friends saying ""you should really talk to a doctor about this."" Tell them ""yes, I want to, but I do not have the energy to make that happen. Here is the log-in to my insurance's website, can you find a doctor for me and stand here while I call and schedule an appointment?"" if you have to. 

I'm also not going to make any claims on how to treat your depression in terms of medication, talk therapy, diet, etc, but I will say this: Talk to your doctor and seriously consider any and all recommendations they offer, including medication. 


Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time
 Phew! Okay, that’s the guide. So to summarize the things you should prep before an episode:

Lists to make:
Your list of absolute bare minimums for every day 
Depression grocery shopping list of foods that are easy but can’t be purchased in advance

Things to have:
Good canned/frozen foods in your pantry/freezer that require no prep
Storable food items that need to be cooked, but are easy
Storable healthy snacks
Mouthwash, baby wipes, and dry shampoo if you’re into that 
Plastic/paper bags for trash 
Paper plates, bowls, and cups
Waterproof box with a lid for dishes 
Disinfectant wipes for cleaning 

People to talk to/things to think about
Talk to people in your support system to see who understands depression; educate those who do not 
Explain the type of help you might need
Think about what level of detail you want to share with various people so you are prepared for when they ask 

Please add any useful tips i missed in the comments, and again, if anyone can find the original guide that a lot of these came from, please lmk/post it in the comments. 

Hope this helps! Stay safe friends!

I found a dead mouse in my gross apartment and had a panic attack that culminated in me hyperventilating in front of my building, texting one friend who I knew was at work, calling another who I knew was off. She dropped everything and came over and cleaned up the dead mouse (when I'm well, dead things freak me the fuck out and while she is grossed out she can still handle it). She helped me clean my closet, took some of my clothes, my bras, and my duvet home with her and washed them while I did some other laundry while we were cleaning. She has depression too and once had somebody do this same thing for her. 

The next night my other friend and her bf came over and helped me with my dishes, kept me company while I folded clothes and steam mopped my floors.

This post is an example of one step, which is great! The next time you feel ready, take another one. Start by sharing with safe people, like a licensed therapist. Maybe one of the things you can work on is figuring out how to open up more. Therapy is a great place to practice conflict situations that can come up from not being willing to trust, so you can tell your therapist something like ""I don't trust you"" and they will work through it with you without forcing you to open up (if they're good at their job). 

I have a really hard time trusting people too, and it really takes time to get over. Some other things that helped were staying in-the-moment, and reacting to things as they happened instead of worrying about what bad things MIGHT happen later on. 

Also, sometimes it's helpful to talk to a pet, doesn't have to be an emotional support animal but it helps. You can practice saying things out loud that make you feel vulnerable before trying it with a person that you think is worthy of that trust. ",2020-03-24 01:17:27

She taught me how to be financially stable. She always showed me the other side of the fence when it came to opinions. And she showed me how to really love unconditionally.

Today she mentioned about a trip she was planning to take in July with the new guy she has been seeing. Yes we are broken up and that's that, however feelings that are lingering still just hurt. 
I'm beating myself up over the fact of how much I let myself down and let her slip away. I've made a promise to myself to never take that kind of love for granted again and never treat another partner like that.

That comparison is going to push people away as you are creating a scenario where you isolate yourself. That’s the depression speaking. That’s what there is to fight. No one will be able to understand your experiences the way that you have. No one will be able to fully understand your pain. But don’t be resentful about it. Try and look at it as positively as possible. Maybe the people you care about that care about you won’t understand your learning disability, but remember that they are trying to, and that really matters. Perception is a huge part of depression.

Your pain is there and you don’t have to justify or quantify to other people’s experiences. All there is to do is move forward and try and find ways to be as happy as possible. We are stuck with the hand we are dealt so instead of being upset you got a shit hand, try and make the most of it. I’m really sorry that you feel this way, but no one is going to make it better but you.

I honestly don’t mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like it’s too much for me to handle.

It’s a tough situation because I feel like I’m not fit to be her emotional support as I’m going through things myself and I haven’t been feeling great for a while but I don’t think I can tell her that, I know she’s going through a lot.
Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i don’t know how to reply to her, I don’t know how to handle it. 
Feels like we don’t talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but it’s so hard.

I know she relies on me for support a lot.

It’s been a few years since this has been happening. She’s always coming to me, and I’m pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness.

After losing some good friends because I was just too overwhelming, I've learned to be very clear with all my friends: I want them to take care of their mental health first.  If I'm looking to them for support, but they're not in a good place themselves, I want them to be honest so that I try to do something for them (if possible), or at the very least, not solely rely on them.  

However, I didn't get to this point, and never truly realized the impact my relying on them had until a very close friend finally said to me one day, after losing many friends over the years, (something along these lines) - ""You're my friend and I really care about you.  I want to be there for you when I can be and I want you to be able to trust me, but I'm also not a professional and it's not fair to you or me to only rely on me for help and support.  I think it would be wise to look into going therapy again.  I'd be happy to help you find one, and would even come with you the first time or two for emotional support"".

Once he said that, everything sort of clicked.  Your friend may not realize what impact she's having.  I recommend trying to say something like the above that works for your situation.  Be honest about where you're at, because she may not realize.  Once I realized in my own situation, I was able to be a little more self-aware, and my friend helped me expand my network of help and support, which helped both of us AND strengthened our friendship more.

943,bfcarp,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,7,"Me and my partner are both depressed, but him much more than me",depression_help,"i've(20m) been with my boyfriend(21m) for a little over 2 years. 

i've always struggled with depression on and off through my life and suffered some severe trauma as a kid. i haven't been to a therapist more than twice in my life.

my partner has had depression ever since he was a kid, he says it's been constant and sometimes he doesn't notice it as much but he says he's always been very depressed. he has never been to a therapist.

we struggle a lot with our relationship. i want so bad to help him and make him feel better. we're a great pair, add a lot to eachother, and understand each other's problems and worries really well. but, while i feel i can kinda manage my depression and it hasn't stopped me from functioning before, he is completely debilitated. 

a lot of the things we do together seem to make him upset, bored, or irritated - and these are some of our favorite things to do together. i've felt that way before too, and i understand he's just as frustrated as i am, but i feel lost when it happens and i dont understand how i can fix it.
i have a really strong fear of abandonment and i cling really hard onto him when i'm at my worst. it's really bad because when he's upset he pulls away, he's afraid of hurting me and others and he directs all his frustration inwards. but by pulling away i pull him harder and its a vicious cycle that leads to us crying and me freaking out, having a near panic attack because he's been ignoring me. 

i don't know how to help him, how to be there for him, i dont even know how to help myself. i let him know he can talk to me and he does and i usually end up trying to give advice. sometimes i just listen but i dont know what to say afterwards, i know he doesnt want advice but how else do i respond or stop the conversation from hitting dead silence or repetetive uh-huh's. 

i love this man, he's the love of my life. i want to spend forever with him. but im terrified of losing him, of hurting him, of failing him. 
how can we support eachother? how do i try and comfort him, and how do i communicate what i need without fear of being too needy?

right now we are both very poor and in college. i have a free therapist on campus i can visit, but his school doesnt have that and he would have to pay to visit a therapist, which we absolutely cannot afford.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bfcarp/me_and_my_partner_are_both_depressed_but_him_much/,35,"I just stumbled upon this post, and it is so so so relevant to my experience lately. My boyfriend and I are in a near exact situation as you both (only I would be your bf in the scenario bc I’m more depressed and my boyfriend would be you bc he tends to be the caregiver). I just wanted to say that I hope things are going okay, and that it really says a lot how much you care about your partner and your relationship.

It’s hard living with depression, especially when it’s severe and lifelong. It’s exhausting and debilitating, you know this. But I think, as everyone else has already stated, it’s important to just take everyday as it comes. Some days are better than others, even though in the moment, they may all seem bad and tiresome. Coming from the perspective of the “more depressed” partner, I feel a lot of guilt about my emotions and my moods/behaviors, so I feel like patience is something really important when it comes to handling mental illness. Your boyfriend may feel like a burden, or like he’s taking up your space and time, so it’s important to remind him how much you care for him and just to listen to him like you have been.

My boyfriend is really good about doing small gestures of love, whether that be giving me a small hand squeeze or a kiss on the head, bringing me a glass of water or a snack, or carrying my bag for me when we’re walking home. He doesn’t even need to say anything, especially because I tend to get sooo exhausted and irritated by conversation sometimes. The silence can be really comforting, so long as I still get some reminders that I’m not a useless/exhausting/depressing person.

Despite all of these things that would probably be helpful for your partner, I think the most important thing is to take care of yourself. Take time for yourself everyday and do things that relax you and make you a bit happier each day. As someone who has a partner who tends to do a lot of the work in the relationship, I am constantly worrying that he isn’t taking care of himself bc he is spending too much time making sure I’m okay. It’s always a huge relief when I see him having a snack or watching some funny videos or doing anything that isn’t caring for me bc I know he is always doing that, despite his own struggles with depression (which is no doubt wildly exhausting). So take care of yourself and things will start to work out hopefully. Life is hard, but it’s full of all kinds of treasures— we just gotta give ourselves extra time and patience to find them sometimes. ",2019-04-20 13:41:36

1- Try to find places that has people, who likes doing the things you do: This can be a sport, gaming, drawing or anything else. I don't know how the school system over there, but mine school have clubs, which made me meet with the people i call friends now. Maybe look at online for meeting of certain groups,that do the thing you like? 

2-Be patient. Don't give up, if you fail to find someone from a meeting you went or from school. Try it again. And again, until you can find that people. Look after yourself, don't push on yourself. Treat yourself nicely. If you need time on thinking, take that time. If you need time alone, go out, walk, breathe in. Try to keep your mind clean. Don't give up and stay determined. 

And always remember that not everything on social media based upon truths. People can lie and fake a smile. Even through they seem like they are spending time with their so called BFF, they might feel lonely inside, their thoughts might be eating them alive.

I tell people around me I don’t feel right, like how I’m abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me.

But I try to lessen the self-hatred by doing things I know I'll be proud of. I've always loved vocalists and harmonies, hence I joined choir this year. Since I am passionate about it, I'm really proud of my identity as a choir member.

Also, forgive yourself for mistakes. It's easy to obsess over things you should have/should not have done. But try to forgive and forget: it's crucial you learn how to. Learn to let go and leave some things behind. This has really helped me.

Finally, surround yourself with people whom you love. Being able to care and love others is a nice feeling. Knowing that you can and will care for others is important, and you yourself will learn to care for yourself. And these people, in time, will likewise care for you.

Stay strong. Self-love is a long process; it's exhausting, some days you feel like you wanna give up, but you have to keep trying. 

Start with small steps, start giving in to yourself, lessen how much you care about how others see you, and bask in you being you. You don't have to be perfect in anyone's eyes except your own.

every now and then i always think about how hard it is for a human being to stay alive. like, there's all these standards you have to live up to, there's all these people judging you all the time, so many factors.

i have a partner that always tells me off every day for very random reasons. today it was because of a girl that added me on social media and i pressed accept, but i haven't talked to her; we just met during a trip that we all went on recently.

i quit my 6 year job recently to pursue an entrepreneurship, now swimming in debt because my product isn't ready to launch yet and i have zero income (actually i have negative income because i still need to pay employees)

my partner wanted to get a dog so now we have a puppy that i have to deal with during the day whilst still working on my useless startup that's not going anywhere. i lack motivation every day because i already feel exhausted dealing with this puppy...

i have no friends, well actually maybe i do have friends but firstly i'm afraid of talking to them because i don't want to get judged, and also because if i do, i have no idea how my partner's going to react (as most of them are female).

ehhh.. i'm just ranting now, i don't expect anyone here to even give any shits about me really -- you don't know me, i don't know you, why would anyone care?

how does a human stay alive?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

you know what i always think -- there's so much stress in my life that it's actually so much easier to just kill myself and be done with it

think about it this way right, if you're dead there's nothing to worry about because you're dead.. how good is that? there's absolutely nothing for you to even care about

it's like the easiest and fastest way out of every single problem

you know what also, i look at my puppy and i feel that even her life is better than mine. she has nothing to worry about, all she need to do is to complain and she'll get pats, cuddles and food. when she's bored she can just fuck around without any care in the world.

974,avmgcc,False,STORY,4,When Love is Not Love,depression_help,"For those of us, who as a result of childhood trauma, suffer from codependency, depression, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or feelings of unlovableness, our view and understanding of what love is, is likely not the view or understanding of others who did not suffer childhood trauma.

An infant or child has an underdeveloped sense of self and other. Therefore, when parents divorce it is common for a child to blame themselves and internalize the marital breakup as being their fault.

Similarly, in an abusive childhood, on a visceral level, a child is taught that he is worthless, unlovable, defective, lacking on some fundamental level. An infant or child may not even consider that the parents abusive actions are not deserved. 

When such a child survives the trauma into adulthood they may learn that the way they were treated was not right, however, no amount of logical reasoning easily removes the deeply imbedded feelings of worthlessness, defectiveness, shame, guilt and unlovableness. Why? Because the child has learnt a core belief on a deep primal and emotional level. The child does not question if he is lovable, he KNOWS in his core, without thinking, that he for a fact is unlovable, worthless, defective and that he should feel intense shame and guilt for talking about it.

Is there hope? Is there a way to undo this terrible damage? It seems that it is not possible on a purely logical reasoning level. 

This has been my personal truth my whole life and I am now 44. In deep discussions with my wife I confirmed my suspicions that my view of love is not the view of love of those who have not suffered childhood trauma. For those without childhood trauma, love is not something that completes them, it adds to and enhances the complete individual that they already are.

On the other hand, for those of us who are survivors of childhood trauma, at a core level we believe we are defective, unlovable, worthless, incomplete. Our adolescence taught us that love is the thing that we need in order to fill this inconsolable pain in our heart. We fantasize about love, we fall in love with the idea of being in love, such aspirations fill us with a sense of longing and desperation to ease our internal pain. 

The only problem is, is that all too often, this does not happen. Even if we find someone who truly loves us for who we are, they never seem to be able to fill that chasm in our soul. The reason for this is because we were taught to believe, and we thoroughly believed an incredible lie our entire lives. What is that lie? The lie we were taught was that we do not deserve consistent love because we are worthless and unlovable. As a teenager we become desperate for the love, attention, validation and approval of others and we take over the role of our parents and we tell ourselves that our feeling lovable and worthy depends entirely on someone else finding us lovable and worthy. Therefore, we spend our time looking for that special person to complete our defectiveness… and of course, in our imagination we find them from time to time… but after the honeymoon period wears off and each persons individuality sets back in, we are again left with this gaping hole in our very being that our partner no longer seems to be able to fill.

These are things I have only come to grip with this week. Like everything, I expect it to take quite some time to heal and to learn new coping strategies. Now when I hear a love song I think, “hmmm… that's a good enmeshment song.” Yesterday I listened to a long list of my favorite desperate love songs from the 1980s,  songs that triggered in me that sense of desperately needing someone to fill the hole in me where love is suppose to be. With every song, while the emotional memory of defectiveness was triggered, I gently reminded myself that this emotion is a lie… so far, this has been my strategy… not to simply identify and correct internal dialogue, but to connect with the emotional triggering memory as intensely as possible while doing so… today I feel much better, and able to collect my thoughts and share them with you because sometimes our view of love is not in fact love, instead we have a foundation of self hate that we want others to fill because our parents did not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/avmgcc/when_love_is_not_love/,33,Very helpful!

&#x200B;

It is very difficult to deal with someone going through depression and it is not your job to fix that person. The best you can do is be supportive and it sounds like you are doing your very best to be that. I am the one with the major depressive issues in my relationship. What I can tell you, is that I really appreciate when my boyfriend would ask me how I was feeling or doing. Which he really didn't do. He felt it would accentuate the negative and reinforce my negativity. I wish he would/had though. But at the same time, I also know that it is exhausting for him to listen to it...and it makes him feel helpless that nothing he can do or say will make it better. We seem to not be able to understand each other in that regard. I need to talk it out. He finds that stressful. My alternative has been to start journaling and utilizing online communities when things get bad. I don't think it is reasonable for me to upset and exhaust him with my shit. My shit is my shit. I think he has to be supportive as much as he can without hurting himself emotionally.  


Best of luck to you both.

979,a7737j,False,None,8,"Thinking of you, Pete",depression_help,"It broke my heart to read Pete Davidson’s message about his suicidal ideation. I find him to be a very real person in the midst of the fabricated reality that is the entertainment industry and his honesty about how his life is tormented with Borderline Personality Disorder and suicidal ideation is a reality that I have close experience in, given my education and work history in the mental health field. 

It is evident that Pete is trying his best to cope with his breakup while juggling his daily battle in feeling uncomfortable in his own skin. By sharing his struggle with BPD, he is demonstrating enormous courage by revealing his humanity on a very public platform- a vulnerability that’s too often ridiculed by criticisms despite his noble efforts of trying to help others. 


Obviously, helping others and spreading joy through laughter gives him a sense of purpose by helping him cope with “not wanting to be on this earth”- an earth that has lately been invalidating and capitalizing on his very real and very raw suffering. 



I hurt when I read his message because anyone with true empathy and compassion can feel his hurt in the way he wrote it- and it’s something I can relate to in my own ways. I commend the bravery, honesty, and respect that he shows himself in what he needs to do in order to feel okay (deleting his IG, posting his feelings, etc). 

And for Ariana- I’m extremely disappointed in her actions. I’m aware that I’m just an outsider to this entire situation and of course, not completely informed of all the details, but the authenticity of Pete’s cry for help cannot be ignored and it’s transparent that he is truly in pieces. 

He is trying to help himself by setting clear boundaries with Ariana by directly telling her she is not healthy for his life. But upon hearing about his post, she shows up uninvited anyways, serving as a sadistic reminder of his pain, all while simultaneously tweeting about her new song’s release and cracking an ill-mannered joke: perverting care and concern into persistent, twisted darkness by fueling the fire of media frenzy, like throwing bloody meat into a shark tank. Did she really think her actions were truly going to help him?

Ariana- I understand that writing songs is your own way of coping with life, however, I found your response to Pete’s message extremely disrespectful, inconsiderate, and completely lacking in class. 
If you truly care for Pete in the way you claim, please try to be more mindful of your public impact by listening to his request for relief by respecting his boundaries. 

So Pete, if you read this somehow, please know that I am praying for your healing and peace. It’s wildly unfair and disgusting that your suffering is under the pop culture microscope for the sake of others’ entertainment and amusement. You may be a comedian but your feelings don’t deserve to be violated in this way. 


Pete- Your life is precious. You make others smile and laugh and forget their own worries. You take shitty circumstances and cleverly craft them into something that brings hope back into this ever-darkening world. 
Also, you have made impactful strides in the likes of mental health advocacy- a realm I am personally passionate about- and I’m so proud of you. 


Please know that you are seen and supported. You are heard. 
Not heard for a script or press release or publicity statement but heard as a humble human being who needs some light during this overwhelming darkness that can be so invasive. 
Your spirit is brave and worthy of happiness. I sincerely hope you find that happiness. 
You truly deserve comfort, peace, and healing.

988,fkzm1y,False,RANT,3,Just a vent from someone who's having a self-loathing and hopeless vision of reality,depression_help,"Well... We live in somewhat complicated times, which is obvious. However, this is something that I can’t allow myself to care about. An apathy definitely became an inherent trait of my ego a while ago...

It has been about a year since I published an introspective analysis of my current life situation somewhere on the internet, besides what were the expectations before I decided to see a psychologist, trying to decipher what is tormenting me. Well... I can say that that first attempt was a failure.

I was only able to seek professional help for a brief period before I was fired from my previous job last year, interrupting the process. On the positive side, I was able to organize my professional life a little after that happened. But on the negative side... I could see that my demons being stronger than before.

Today, I'm approaching 30 years old, and given the circumstances, I’m not the happiest and hopeful person I used to be...

I have no one to blame. No one but myself... Countless wrong decisions have taken me to where I am today. Decisions that admit they can be corrected and put back by myself, thus making a fresh start. But... These decisions were much more severe with my inner spirit than with the others.

Apathy, hopelessness, and hatred... These are things that make me who I am today. The rancor of having to let myself go into this spiral of despair and my self-loathing prevents me from looking for something better... I don't feel worthy to be happy, let alone stop feeling pain. And you know the worst of it? All the eventual calls for me to seek support from other people sounds false to me...

Yes. It is a claim that it will really sound rude, but I have to say:

""I don't trust any of you. I’m not able to trust""

I’m sorry for that, as I’m unable to see any act of affection, empathy, and appreciation. I know that a lot of this isn’t true, but that’s something I’m unable to see...

Things like faith and hope lost the meaning to me, for having become something vague and inconclusive to hold on. Any acts of goodwill strike me as hypocritical and empty, just with the intention of shutting up someone who is about to recover. This world seems so fucked up that it basically causes me zero strength to care for a single drop with it.

Obviously, I am still a long way from acting belligerently, suicidal and sociopathic at this age of crisis, but I’m tired to wait any longer. The sad part of all this is that I have a wife and a son who I’m can’t have the strength to fight for them and keep myself sane... This is truly a Herculean task.

I really think I should shut up about this. Spare people from this senseless anguish... But I'm still human. I don't know if I'm going to stay whole if I can't shout in some way or another.

As for my future? Only time will tell...",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/fkzm1y/just_a_vent_from_someone_whos_having_a/,33,"Something similar happened to me (actually, when I was 30), though it was brought on by very bad medical advice. I was newly pregnant, and since you have a child, you know that the OB won’t see you until you’re 8 weeks in. But my antidepressant that I’d taken for years had a big warning against taking while pregnancy, and I was terrified of something happening to the baby, and I called my psychiatrist, and he told me to stop taking it immediately. Not to cut it down, just stop. Within a week, I was in a bizarre state of what I later learned was anhedonia. Nothing made me feel anything. I was scared it would never go away - that was my only feeling. 

I did find a new psychiatrist, and since it’s not an easy specialist to get an appointment with, I stayed with him. He wasn’t the best, but he was sane. As I started taking my meds again, I also started a volunteer job which I loved. Things got better so slowly, I didn’t realize they were improving at all.

Before I asked her out (days before), I had been getting incredibly nervous, and I was feeling anxious, and I didn't even know how I was feeling. I figured it was just nerves, but it kept up afterwards. I don't know why, but after she said yes, I cried for an hour. I didn't have a date in mind, at that point it was eating me up inside and I just had to ask, so it's been a week and I've still barely kept in contact. I've just been feeling more depressed than I ever have, and I've never felt anxiety, but now it's constant and acute.

It's been 6 days and I don't know what to do. I constantly feel sad, numb, and scared. It hurts, it really does. It's been emotional pain in my head constantly for a week and a half. I still want to date her, everything has gone so well and I've never clicked with someone like I have with her, but I feel so depressed that being around her doesn't cheer me up, it just makes me feel guilty for being depressed around her instead of making her happy, like I usually make every effort to. My friends are all downstairs playing games together, and they're probably wondering why I'm not with them (I told them ""I'll be there soon,"" before scampering upstairs to hide under my covers), and why I've been so withdrawn. I don't know what to tell my friends, and I don't know what to tell her. I don't know whether to tell them all that I've been depressed, so that they don't think that I just don't want to prioritize spending time with them, or whether I should just tell her, or whether I shouldn't tell anyone. Me and her are both 18 and have never been in a relationship or dated anyone before. Normally I'd say wait and see, but having asked her out, the clock is ticking. I'm just in pain and I don't know what to do to make it stop. In the past, I've been able to think my way out of my depression, but now I can't.

Even though in your case, it's true.  If she really likes you, she's going to get her feelings hurt because girls/women have a tendency to internalize rejection.  No matter what you say, she will probably leave feeling like she wasn't good enough for you and may be angry and resentful.  

If she's not really that into you, she will probably take it more gracefully.  And ironically that's your best outcome right now because you're not ready for a relationship.  It sounds like her ""yes"", put you into a tailspin.  And for some reason the prospect of a relationship overwhelms and scares you.

If it were me, I'd just say let's just go back to platonic friends.  Nothing sounds more narcissistic than, ""when I'm good and ready, I'll be your boyfriend."".  Its also just insulting.  And you don't sound narcissistic at all.  I would convey to her you'd just drag her down.  And you don't think it's fair to her to do that.  Whether or not you tell her everything you've been feeling should be based on whether you *really* trust her to keep it private.  Mental health is a very personal thing, and it could harm you more for her to start gossiping about something so serious.  And this is serious.  

But you're taking the right steps by reaching out to a professional for help.  That takes a lot of strength.

Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. 

I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. 

  
I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ""ending it all so they'll be better of"" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?

Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat (like Dry Cereal or a Pop-Tart or something like that you don't have to do anything to) and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

So what ends up happening is laundry and cleaning and everything else builds up for the weekend and then on the weekend I spend most of the time getting the house back to a normal person level of reasonable and maybe cooking one meal and then back to the week and having to ration my energy to make sure I keep a job. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP that I wear every night but I'd still don't get the best sleep. I have some mobility issues due to injury from the Army and also being overweight. I'm working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert. 

 So I'm wondering tips on how to get more energy despite my depression so that maybe I can get at least a little more done so that my weekends could be more than just using up that energy to make up for what doesn't get done during the week due to my lack of energy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bdshia/trying_to_have_energy/,28,"You could get a self cleaning litter box like [this](https://www.chewy.com/petsafe-simply-clean-automatic/dp/48655?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=hg&utm_content=PetSafe&utm_term=&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-tXlBRDWARIsAGYQAmeRwd9RHPqcGc2mgboEf0XavE7Kk5-AXanrv6vgUK9V4O6jb86b5pQaAo1_EALw_wcB), if something like that is in your budget. All you have to do is change the bag once a day. Also, auto feeder bowls and waterers can be handy. 

Healthy snacks high in protein and low in sugar may do you some good. Granola bars, dried/fresh fruits and veggies, nuts, etc would be easy healthy snacks. If you have time on the weekend, you could prepare healthy meals in bulk, then divide them into separate portions and freeze them for later eating. Cheaper than most fast food and frozen meals, with the right ingredients.

 If you're not feeling up to tons of laundry, you could drop your dirty clothes in the wash daily until it fills, wash and dry them, then set them aside until you do have the energy. 

Some daily b vitamins may help with your energy levels, although I'd consult with your doctor first to make sure there wouldn't be any interactions with your current meds. You could try experimenting with different ways to help you to sleep. [These](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-fall-asleep) tips might be beneficial.

 I used to limit my sugar and caffeine to daytime hours only, plus hot nightly baths to help me through rough depression patches. Hopefully you can find some things to get you closer to your desired amount of sleep and energy. ",2019-04-16 10:50:28
997,b8zyho,False,RANT,8,"Overwhelmed, clutching at straws and losing control of my life...",depression_help,"I don't know why I am even typing this, but I am.  I can't say how I feel because I feel more numb than anything, but this is my status:

&#x200B;

I have become so overwhelmed this fortnight, and my head is a hurricane of thoughts that I can't pinpoint so cannot focus on anything.

&#x200B;

Everything is  a struggle and I am behind in work, house chores, personal hygiene and spending time with my fiance.

&#x200B;

Knowing I am behind is just causing the pressure on my shoulders to increase and is shutting me down even more.

&#x200B;

I have no purpose, I don't enjoy my work, my life rotates around trying to pay for the house and bills each month.  My only goal in my life has been to have kids, but I am 31 this year and overweight and it's just not happening.  I feel like I have no right to be a mother when I get like this and it makes me so anxious that I will never be a fit a parent.  

&#x200B;

I have been with my fiance for 11 years but I feel like I am causing problems because I just can't do things that I should be able to - he has to do all the chores, the cooking and nag me to do basic things like clean my teeth which is so embarrassing for me.

&#x200B;

I don't want to go back on anti-depressants because we are trying for a baby, and I feel to embarrassed to go back to my therapist because I have lost my fight, and depression has knocked me down again.

&#x200B;

I am self-employed and losing the will to do the work which means I don't get paid which adds to the stress of paying for the bills etc.

&#x200B;

...I know I am the only person to sort myself out. I know I can't get an instant ""cure"" for this, and I know what the practical and realistic answer is to my next question but I will ask it anyway because it is on my mind and I don't have anyone else to ask it towards...

&#x200B;

Have you ever had the strength to just up sticks and start fresh somewhere new to give your head a new start?  I'm not talking about leaving my partner, but more my house and work to move somewhere new.

&#x200B;

...it wont matter though, will it?  Because depression is inside you, not around you and until you figure it out yourself you will never escape.

&#x200B;

I really hate having depression.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/b8zyho/overwhelmed_clutching_at_straws_and_losing/,28,"Please ensure you have selected a flair for your post.

I used use depression tribe but that went a bit too self help a bit overboard with cbt and just changing problems 
People are a bit / lonely just make friend, jobless just get a job tomorrow, hate your job stick it out and quit, read god damn book if you are feeling low..
Some idiot told someone whose just lost someone go and get a new husband/wife  that person got banned..

In ryl/sf people don’t do that often, just say they don’t last long and you cant really say I’m going off for fag be back in tick cos mods are on you... they can be a bit too recovery focused at times.. 
I am like give people space, not all people smoke/vape. drink alcohol or fast/exercise excessively to point of needing help 24/7 for some it’s normal part of daily life.. people vape all the times., people smoke fags.. if you want places where you can discuss things with people,, smoke, vape, use  weed and etc .. typical activities of daily living and doesn’t feel wrong a bad thing stick with reddit  ",2019-03-24 04:10:50
999,a2itc2,False,None,4,People acting like they feel bad for me is making my depression worse.,depression_help,"So about 6 months ago something happened that sent me into the worst depression of my life. I already get depression sometimes, but up until a few months or less ago I was ready to kill myself.

I ended up moving back in with my parents (did not want to, I didn’t grow up in a healthy household and it’s still not healthy) and quitting my job (about 4 months ago).

I’m currently picking myself back up. I’m at the point that I know when I get a new job I will for the most part be back to normal. 

Whenever I talk to my mom about putting out applications and what I’m doing, she just gives me this sad looking smile. 

I know that my mom/parents are not healthy...honestly I need to move out of here when I can (there are a lot of reasons that I won’t go into right now). 

But I guess in my state of mind this really bothers me. I’m trying to get back on my feet and instead of someone there to say “you can do this!” I get this pity look. I don’t understand. It makes me go back into that thinking pattern of “what’s the point?”.

I don’t need praise in normal life, but with what I’ve been through/am going through it would be nice to have some positive support.

I don’t really have anyone else besides my parents right now and one friend that I see occasionally. (Another thing I plan to start working on, making more friends). 

Any advice or suggestions on how to deal with this within myself? (I’m not interested in trying to change someone else). ",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/a2itc2/people_acting_like_they_feel_bad_for_me_is_making/,30,"I know this feeling and there is nothing worse for my mental health than when I perceive that people feel bad for me/that they pity me. What I’ve learned to do in those situations though is to use that pity and the feeling of frustration that comes along with feeling like people don’t believe that you can pull yourself out of the rough patch as motivation to submit applications, go out and try something new, etc. This is really hard to do when you’re in the thick of a depressive or anxious episode, but it seems like you’re really determined to work hard to rebuild and restructure your life. With that basis already there, using those looks and feelings of frustration as a kind of fuel to prove that you are capable and don’t need/want/require pity can be really really helpful  ",2018-12-02 23:49:50
