0,gwcixr,False,Rejections,183,Is it me or getting a job is really hard getting a job,jobs,"Graduated last year in Computer Science and GIS from a good college. Applying heaps of jobs from January till today and all I got is a ""Thank you for applying, unfortunately.."" response of rejection letter.

Even in January it is already difficult to even get a job, now with the coronavirus and recession I felt like this is like playing life on hard mode. Sorry If you gotta read this, I just gotta rent on my thoughts for being unemployed for way too long. For anyone who is on the same boat as me, let's hope the best will come.

Edit: thank you for so many kind words and tips, also I should've mention that I live in a small city in New Zealand and job itself is already quite limited. So now in the meantime, I'm improving my portfolio and thinking of doing some sort of freelancing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gwcixr/is_it_me_or_getting_a_job_is_really_hard_getting/,486,"It is hard to get a job, i had a job offer after college but i thought that it wasn't worth it and declined it, and it resulted in a year long unemployment.

1,h8vk9r,False,Rejections,84,"I feel traumatized after my ""first"" job after college",jobs,"Okay, I graduated in 2018 so this happened nearly two years ago but it's something that has stayed with me since, and I don't know how to seek past it. First off, I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this, if anyone could direct me to where this would be more appropriate, please do so!

&#x200B;

In 2018, I graduated with a degree in supply chain, job search was extremely hard but somehow I landed an inventory planner role at a small-mid food/trading company. Now this job was a disaster for me. There wasn't any kind of onboarding that allowed me to be acquainted with the operations of the company, I was given so much information and responsibilities that I could not retain everything, and it seemed like I was asking very stupid questions. My excel skills was very subpar at the time too, I never learned more beyond the excel I used at school. I had to google to learn how to do things on Excel on the job and the manager was very frustrated at me and he told me point blank that ""I thought you graduated from a good business school, what happened? Did you lie about your credentials?"" I was flabbergasted. He handed me a supply chain for dummies book and told me to study it, and it hurt my self worth a lot. I WAS passionate about supply chain and still retained a lot of things I learned at school, however I thought it was okay to not remember/know everything and that you would learn on the job?

&#x200B;

Anyway, after a week, I knew that place couldn't be for me and we mutually decided to part ways as I knew he'd let me go sooner or less. Job search after that became even harder than it was before, I felt worthless and unconfident to start a career in supply chain, I went on so many interviews and failed to secure a position in the field. I am now working in an unrelated career path. It's a humble career, but I feel like I could do more with myself and get paid a lot more, especially since I have a double major in supply chain and information systems. But the thing is, that ""first"" job greatly traumatizes me to this day and I feel like I could never be good to work in an analyst or planner role within supply chain. COVID 19 has really set me back this year as well, I wanted it to be the year where I'd leave my current job and seek a job in supply chain, but right now I care a lot about job security. I don't want to land a job in supply chain and have it end up like my first job, with me having to leave or be let go because I am unqualified.

&#x200B;

Did anyone ever have this problem or feeling when you had you first job after college, where you wholly unprepared and unqualified?

EDIT: First off -- wow, thank you everyone for your incredible support. I wrote this post not knowing I'd get this many responses. It's hard for me to formulate my thoughts and reply to each post, but I have read all of your responses and will take your advice to heart. I'm glad to know that I wasn't the only one going through this (I actually shouldn't say glad, it's sad that it's happened to so many people as well). It really just seems like I was very unlucky in my first job and what happened was not at all my fault.

2,hc2kpp,False,Rejections,15,Lost a great job offer and it was my fault. Could use advice or encouragement going forward.,jobs,"Hi guys, this is my first post here. I (28f) wanted to get some advice or encouragement from you guys because I'm sure a lot of you are all in the same job hunting boat right now. Well end of May I got a job offer after being let go from my last company. It was the perfect position. It was work from home, it matched my Salary, full benefits, great pto, you get the idea. I impressed in the interview and they loved that I had my series 6 and 63 licenses. So I go through the drug test and background check. Well the HR person emailed me saying she couldn't  verify my education. I told her no worries, id contact my school and get it sorted. I talked to an advisor  and it turns out...I never finished my general associates degree. I was off by a few credits. 

I was 19 at the time, I thought I had finished all the credits, and I was getting married that same month. With all that on my plate I thought well when I want a copy of my degree I'll just call. I feel so stupid now. No jobs that I had between then and up til now ever questioned my degree, so I didn't  think to check myself. That is my own fault and I completely  understand. I'm going back to finish the last few classes. However, now as far as job hunting...I screwed myself. I can't have that on my resume or application  anymore. I have all the certifications and licenses that I did obtian through my previous employer, which looks great to potential jobs, but I'm afraid my lack of even just a 2 year degree is going to ruin any chance I have. 

Well needless to say, the company rescinded their offer, even after I gave an explanation. I'm crushed. I was perfect for the job. It was such a step up from my previous job and i felt like i was finally moving up in my career. Normally I'd just be disappointed and think well there's plenty of big companies I can apply to. Now that I know I don't have my degree I have no confidence that I even stand a chance. I can't even talk to anyone in my family about it, they all think I have my associates and I'm just too embarrassed to tell them. I feel absolutely awful and worthless. 

I'm making a plan to finish my courses and I'm still sending out my resume. I just am so disappointed with myself.

I had a Zoom interview one month ago, then one week ago I got called in for a face-to-face interview, in which the interviewers told me they were very interested in my profile, skillset and experience, leading me to believe it almost was a done deal. Yesterday I got an email (at 11.41 pm on a Friday night) saying they decided not to offer me the position. To say I am disappointed it’s un understatement. The way they talked to me and praised my working profile, really led me to believe I was the guy they were looking for. Maybe I misread the situation, I do not know. Anyhow, I was very interested in the position. I would like to call the interviewer and simply ask him what were the main reasons why I got rejected. Was my long period of notice at my current job (2 months), so they went for someone who was going to be available earlier than me? Was the money I asked too much for their budget? My mind is spiraling right now. I would like to call just to understand what I don’t have to do/say the next time I got lucky to get a recruiting opportunity.

I interviewed for a job this past Tuesday. Shortly after, I emailed my interviewers, including the hiring manager, to thank them for their time.

I emailed back immediately to let them know I accepted their offer and I even received a response saying they were ""happy"" to have me ""on board."" 

However, today I got a voicemail/email saying that I was offered the position by accident, that it was an email/working-from-home ""glitch."" I'm absolutely stunned and devasted. 

Here is the email I received:

""Hi \_\_\_\_,

I am back in the office today and just left you a message.  I made a huge error in saying we've offered you the position. Working from home, I had computer glitches and made an error. Given that I do want to let you know you're high on our list, but still waiting to hear back from everyone on the team about ranking.  I am deeply sorry for this mistake and hope you understand. Please call me if you have any questions.""

Like I said, I'm stunned and so, so sad about this. Any tips for how I should respond? I can't think clearly right now and I've never experienced anything like this before.

Since being laid off, which has now been 3 years, I've been day trading stocks, mostly options, and I've been living off of that. I'm not rich, but day trading was paying rent and the bills.

When the market heavily went down back in march, I put my cash into VOO and BRK.B. My plan is to just leave it there for a long time. I do not want to day trade anymore. I want a ""real job.""

I have applied to a lot of jobs, and I've gotten phone interviews. But every time I bring up my liberal arts degree, the interview immediately goes south.

Every single time I'm asked the dreaded question of: what have you been doing the past 3 years? It immediately goes south when I tell them I was buying and selling stocks / reading quarterly reports. When I tell them I've now put my money into a safe tech ETF / berk, and I'm looking for a 9-5 job, I always get an awkward weird silence then never hear back from them.

I applied for a book keeping position that laughed when I said I was a former day trader.  The ironic thing was the job only paid 14 an hour.  I was averaging 200 a day with stocks (minus tax).

9,h9q12s,False,Rejections,8,"Got rejected from a job I told everyone I was going to get, Feel like an idiot",jobs,"I’ve spent the last 3 years of my life working an entry level clerical accounts receivable job where I’m pretty much just a glorified collections specialist. I’ve tried applying for internal promotions, but my lack of seniority and inability to reference my current job as relevant experience prevents me from moving up. My boss refuses to give me any kind of stretch assignments with other teams to pad my experience. I get paid hourly and make $35K/year; I live paycheck to paycheck. My company is run so bureaucratically and I hate clocking in and out every day like a common wage slave. I’m so miserable here.

A job for a company in a different state opened up about 2 months ago, and I applied for it. I actually know a lot of the people at that company and have some very good relationships with the employees, even the hiring manager. The interview went extremely well overall. I did poorly on the Excel test I was given, but they seemed to care a lot more about the interview itself, and the hiring manager said that a lot of applicants tend not to do well on the test. I was so confident I was going to get it that as soon as I got back I couldn’t stop talking to my coworkers about it. My supervisor was also positive I was going to get it that she actually had me train a potential replacement for my current job.

Well, my coworker has similarly good relations with this company as well and applied to the same job, unbeknownst to me. He’s a few years younger than me and has only worked here for less than a year, so he has much less experience than me. Apparently he scored perfectly on the Excel test and rocked the interview. We interviewed 3 weeks ago, and last week when I got my rejection email he got an offer letter. This job was the biggest opportunity of my life, and I feel like such an idiot after bragging about it for the past several weeks to all my friends and coworkers. I think I was probably the runner up and would have for sure gotten it if my coworker hadn’t applied. I don’t even know what to do now because my current job is so bad with such an uninteresting title that I have no chance of getting a better job somewhere else other than where I applied. I feel like my best bet now is to keep waiting around here until something opens up internally for me to apply to, but I’ll probably get rejected from that too.

TD;LR at the bottom.

Hello! 

Background:

I am very soon to be a graduate with a BA Hons in sociology and social policy. In February I applied for a job within my local council to be an admin officer in the housing department which I was super excited about. I didn't hear back and thought I just hadn't gotten it but they phoned me in May for a video interview!

Present:

On Monday, I did the interview with a panel of three and it went quite well, I showed my enthusiasm and knowledge around housing and they seemed to respond. However, I had a feeling I wasn't quite the right candidate.

My gut feeling was confirmed yesterday when I got a phone call to say I was unfortunately, unsuccessful. Yet, the interviewer was impressed with my enthusiasm and stated they didn't want to lose a talented individual, so they wanted to set up a casual video discussion.

This, this caught me by surprise and I wasn't quite sure what to say apart from, yes, please! They asked me if I had any questions already, but I sort of choked as I really wasn't expecting it so I am a bit afraid I came off a bit unwilling, if that makes sense? However, I am so grateful as I was dissapointed not to get the position but to be recognised was immense.


The point:

Basically, how do I not mess this opportunity up and really make the best of it?

20,gt7kkz,False,Rejections,4,Feedback questions after rejection when you work alongside the interviewers,jobs,"Hello all,

I recently applied for a position at the company I currently work for, it was for a position that is directly related to the degree I am working on. The experience from the position would have impacted the time frame for professional licensing in the career field. I was recently notified that I did not get the position, but was told that I was the runner up and really impressed those I was interviewed by. Since I work in the department already and somewhat close to those I was interviewed by, I am finding it difficult to come to terms with the decision that was made, I suppose it is the norm of rejection. I am taking it a bit personal since once this pandemic is over and we return to the office I will see those I was interviewed by again. It’ll be a while before that happens and I think I’ll be fine and over it by then. For now I come to ask for some advice from you all, I have asked for interview feedback and was asked to set up a meeting by one of the interviewers, scheduled a couple weeks from now. What questions should I be asking? I am going to stay professional no matter what. I just don’t really know what I should be asking. All I can think of is “why not me?” I’ve gotten good feedback from the other interviewers through e-mail and from superiors who were privy to some direct information so I really don’t know what to expect. Thank you all for your time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt7kkz/feedback_questions_after_rejection_when_you_work/,2,"You can put your best foot forward and still not get the job because someone else did just that tiny bit better. Sometimes it's just not meant to be and you have to come to terms with that. Honestly, it's better to come away thinking that it's a missed opportunity that you tried your best on and it was out of your hands than because you didn't try hard enough and you know you could have.

Mind you, what you're feeling is of course completely normal in this situation, and it's always going to be awkward if you're applying for a role where you work with the interviewers if it doesn't work out.

In terms of feedback, think of a few key moments in the interview you might want to get feedback on. Were there any particular questions you struggled with? What did the interviewers think of your responses to certain questions. Did you miss any opportunities to talk about X, for example? What did you answer well? Make a note of which responses were a hit or a miss. A lot of interview questions are the same so you'll probably end up answering a lot of the same stuff in your next interview.

I think it's also fair for you to ask what it was that put the other person ahead of you. Sometimes there's a legit reason, like maybe they have a bit more experience so would be easier to train, for example. It will be interesting to see what they say here. ",2020-05-30 03:52:41

1) is it good that I made it all the way to the hiring committee?

2. It's hard to say if you were or not. Google has a very proprietary hiring system where you are scored on a variety of criteria. You did well enough score-wise to move you forward to HC.  


That being said, Google does do better than most with respect to giving feedback to candidates. I don't think that you necessarily need it; there were probably other factors going on which got them to reject you at this stage. From what I was told by a friend who is a recruiter at Google, it's very rare that you get rejected at that stage - but it is known to happen - probably because they couldn't truly find a spot for you in any group at the company.

My suggestion to you is to simply thank the recruiter for her time and see if you can apply again in 6 - 12 months. Maybe by then you will be able to get through HC.

The position in question was the next higher up position in our department and I was the only one who was internal.  At first my boss said it would just need to be posted three days as an internal posting but then no action was taken to interview for it for months.  I finally get my interview scheduled directly after multiple meetings by my boss so that I wasn’t even able to prepare.  On top of this, the interview committee is made up only of my boss and coworker.  I thought the interview went as well as could be, but turns out I didn’t have the skills she was looking for based on her vision for the position which wasn’t even how the job description read.

My boss’ answers felt like excuses to me.  She claimed her committee was neutral, but I don’t know how that was possible when the two that interviewed me were my bosses and she even stated she would have liked to hear more of my examples from my current role even though I provided examples from all of my previous positions.

I'm in an awful job run by a bully. I wanted to move into a new industry Digital PR which is a side step from what I currently do, Digital Marketing. Got in touch with a company who already knew me and very kindly offered me a casual interview. That went pretty well and then I completed a task they  had asked for, to which they replied very quickly saying 'i'd made it really easy for them, that was a great project and you've got the job.' I was ecstatic, I can't tell you how happy I was, I had my whole new life there set in my head.

Unfortunately, here's where I went wrong. I always thought this was a time to negotiate. I currently earn £26k, and I know if I was going on to another digital marketing job I could easily now earn £30k. However, I had expressed to them in my interview before that I understand that 30k might not be possible as I was moving into a slightly different industy without the direct experience, so I said I just didn't want to go below my current salary. 

In their offer, they offered me £26k with it going up to £27k after 6 month probation. I expressed my joy and keeness but asked if there was any way for a 27k start with it going up to 28k. Yes, I got greedy, I hate myself for it now. Also the job they had advertised for was 'digital pr exec' but when they offered me it they said 'junior digital pr exec' and I asked if we could keep it to the original title I had applied for as I didn't want it to appear like a step back in my career.

They retracted their offer. They explained why and I get it. To them they were already taking a bit of a risk on me as it was a different industry that I didn't have direct experience in and they believed they were being very generous to match my currently salary for what they consider a junior role. They said they worried I wasn't thinking of it as a long term job because of my salary expectations.

I recently had an interview with a genetic testing company (prenatal testing), for an associate sales rep position. I truly felt like the interview went really well. I was very enthusiastic about the position, and I felt like I connected well with the person I was interviewing with. Our convo was upbeat, I asked a lot of questions, and there was no awkward silence during the 45 minutes we spoke.
Today I got a call and was told they are no longer going to consider me a candidate for this position, primarily due to my lack of experience as a recent college grad. The recruiter then told me that the only feedback they could give me is to have “a little bit more energy”, which completely caught me off guard. Although I would describe myself as outgoing and a people-person, I definitely have a calm demeanor. I don’t have a super hyper personality all the time, but I can’t change that. I feel very discouraged and like I’m not cut out for a career in medical sales because of this. I know this was my very first interview, but Im finding myself questioning my abilities. Does anyone have any advice out there? Or similar stories to share?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fxilql/feeling_very_discouraged_after_first_job/,1,"I've had similar feedback that sounded like it was meant for a different person. Take it in stride, when you talk about your experiences, talk in terms of what you can do for them, not what you've done in the past. I found making that change helped me. ",2020-04-09 00:46:44

They literally described their career background, how much more experience they have, and even the type of degree they have!

My wife and I recently relocated, and finding a steady job in this area's market has been scarce.

I graduated last August, I just turned 21 this month. When I first started applying for jobs, for every 3 applications, I was getting at least one interview. I didn't even apply to many jobs. Maybe 20, got 6 offers. Dazzled everyone by being a 20 yr old graduate - my grades were shit but most employers seemed to be easily impressed. One or two from my town knew who I was since I was my hs' val and young at the time. So that halo carried over. Ended up taking a job at the same company my mother worked, great paying corporate position. Got fired in a week (Oct '19). I hated my former boss for (what I felt at the time) ruining my life over an assumption. I have almost no job experience and a useless degree in English. I got a seasonal job for two months but in my parents' opinion, I've been unemployed for five months now.

I just keep applying. I apply to a minimum of 10 - 15 jobs a day since the day I lost that job. I don't get a single phone call or interview (aside from during the holiday season) but I keep trying. I've been rejected from retail, grocery stores, convenience stores, fast food, warehouses, admin/offices, several cities, school boards, states, and the feds. Businesses small and large. Countless internships. I have no friends, hobbies, or talents. But I don't stop. My only blessing is that I have zero responsibilities or bills. My day consists of applying for jobs, reading, and studying (I'm enrolled in a post bacc program through my uni online). 

I have no motivation for anything but getting a decent job. There is nothing special that pushes me forward. I just want to achieve the bare minimum an adult should achieve.

I'm trying to figure out what happened and how I can move forward to hopefully avoid another situation like this. 

Here's the background:

Back in Nov. I applied for an open position with a nonprofit's national office. Their team is less than 10 people, but they have chapters all across the US and have a proper BoD. I moved forward with two interviews (with the executive director and the president) by January and ultimately found out that I did not get the position, but they stressed multiple times that they wanted me to keep them in mind in case any potential positions opened up. I thanked them and told them that I would definitely keep them in mind, because they're an organization that I've long wanted to be the start of my professional career. I have multiple friends and connections who have both worked and currently work there, so I felt that I knew the organization well. 

A week after I sent my thanks and notice that I'd keep them in consideration, the executive director reached out and said that a position had opened up in a different department and before they opened it up for applications, they wanted to see if I'd be interested. I immediately replied and that same day I had a fairly informal conversation over video with the exec director and the president again. The convo was essentially them describing the job and its requirements and I was even more excited because this was a position I had the most experience in and felt I would do well in. At the end of the talk, they said they'll get together and ""see if we can make you that job offer"" and would let me know. This was on February 5 and then on the 14th, after hearing nothing from them, I saw that they posted the job and were looking for applications. This past Monday I sent an email to the executive director and asked for a follow up and haven't received anything since. I'm mostly upset that they're not being communicative because they've always touted that they're the type of organization to communicate with applicants if they got the job or not, and I'm not even getting any updates or an explanation. I'm pretty confused at what to do at this point and I don't want to be pushy and send out another email next week. But if there are typical or common reasons an employer will do this, then I'd like to know so I can see if there's anything I can change when I interview at other places. I would hate to get my hopes up again and another employer does the same as that one.

There were a few results for me, and a zillion for some other guy with the same name - mugshots and criminal histories (violent felonies). This is not me, and we don't look the same. Different middle initial, but that doesn't always appear, and I don't use my middle anyway.

So I imagine a potential employer googles my name, sees all those results, assumes he is me, and my resume goes right into the reject pile. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this? I suppose I could put something in my resume like ""If you google me, you'll find a ton of results for a violent felon, but that's not me."" But that's pretty unprofessional, not to mention it would make sure that in case someone forgot to, they'll be sure to google me and see all that stuff.

Anybody else ever have this problem? Any ideas? It seems that barring personal contacts or recommendations, I'm pretty much destined for automatic instant rejection for any decent legitimate job just because a convicted violent felon shares my name.

Spent the last month job hunting as my contract was coming to an end. Have happily picked up a new gig, but found an email in my junk folder which kind of caught me off guard. 

There was a receptionist position for a local vet's office, and I thought I'd give it a go as I had experience. Their interview process was via answering machine- you'd call it, it'd give you questions, and then you had to answer all of those questions by the end of the beep. I passed that, and they sent me a text message instead of calling a week later asking for: 

1. Resume 
2. Motivation Letter (not a cover letter?) 
3. Results of a Gretchen Rubin personality quiz.
4. A list of five good points about me, and five negatives. 
5. A situation where I'd handled conflict (standard face to face interview question) 
6. My ""Life Values"" (5 minimum) 

The whole thing clocked in at more than 6 pages, and at that point I was starting to think it was a little much for a receptionist position which they kept plugging in the ad had to be a ""great superstar"" at their job. But I thought maybe they were just super busy and didnt have time to interview applicants through the usual process. In my motivation letter I explained offhandedly I'd someday love to become a vet nurse, and that I'd love to study while working there.

Providing exceptional customer service is very important to me and I've been recognized at my current and past positions for my ability to deliver such customer service while thinking on my feet.

I'm only 23 years old, have my bachelors degree, have experience working in the travel industry (3rd party booking website, cringy, I know).

My question is: despite always applying, is this industry just not meant for me? I hate my current job but I'm thankful I have a job. It's call center work, and being verbally abused/dehumanized on a daily basis has made my life hell. I have no friends anymore because all I do is work. I've turned to substance abuse via prescription painkillers.  I experience anhedonia 24/7. How do I escape? I wish I could quit or something right now, but I need the money because I recently filed for bankruptcy.

I was wondering if anybody here in a hiring role or who works with any immigrants that got on with work visas have any tips for her to get hired. I don’t need the money from her working even if the income would be nice so we can take our time and be selective with roles. 

As far as her English is concerned she has enough fluency to hold conversations with people with some difficulty when it comes to nuanced language or metaphors she isn’t used to. But if people talk slow and are direct she gets it and her reading comprehension is really good so I don’t think it’s only a language issue even though that could be at play. But again she hasn’t even gotten to the phone interview part so that would be a preconceived prejudice against her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f0j3c1/getting_accounting_gigs/,4,"Language is going to be an issue, but it’s not what’s holding her back now if she hasn’t gotten interviews yet.

Hi everyone,

My main account is elsewhere, but I don't like this conversation to be tied to that name-specific account. Here goes nothing, in bullet points:

* I studied journalism, finished about five years ago.
* Very focused person. Usually i'd like to get on with my job, don't care about talking too much.
* Went through hell in the lower educations. Always worked hard, but was on my own a lot. Liked reading and making assignments a lot. Definitely not stupid, but courses like math and physics eluded me. Sometimes my logical mind hicks up, and it's hard to follow and draw the same conclusions everybody else does. In Dutch it's called ''omdenken'', thinking the other way around.
* Motivation came from good grades, but that suffered with higher-performing friends. This ended in a gaming and computer addiction for me, and I know basically everything there is to know about motorsports. Not liking yourself and not accomplishing dates and the usual stuff made me run into these hobbies.
* Extremely generalist with some specialist topics, since I'd like to read a lot I know heaps of info in for example (pop)science, psychology, now going more towards politics. Usually my contribution in conversations is asking questions about topic or person, and popping (fun)facts like Dr House did with Vicodin.
* Getting along with people my age is ok-ish nowadays, but before i couldn't really. only focussed on performing and my mental health suffered, thought I could out-work it. Much younger and much older people is what I click with usually.
* Since half a year getting some treatments with psychological help, and a course about vision. That is starting to kick in, which I'm happy about.
* Motivation is really hard to maintain. I don't know what to do. Trying to clear my clauset first, also with parents, they have a hard life with chronic disease and other private things. Getting things done can be a pain too, and new things usually translate to pressure for me. I have troubles relaxing into things, hanging up a bin by drilling holes can take a long time.

Why I'm posting here, and not elsewhere, is that since graduation it's been a struggle. That was five years ago, early thirties now. The problem is that only in the last year of my studies the bells started ringing, and I started performing. After that I couldn't land a job, since basically the schools flooded the market here with graduates. Then they had a better portfolio, now they are younger too. There is so much work you can do here, but usually unpaid or really poorly paid.

I tried to get some experience in volunteering and doing social media for some parties, did manual labor in the other time (but since it doesn't motivate me at all, I tried to keep that to a minimum) but every time they are interested, someone else comes along and lands the actual job. ''We have found someone who fits our profile better.'' Not sure what to do now, I have a parttime editorial job at a racing website, the first who pay me and decently. Now I am thinking about digging into SEO and marketing/communication, and also I would like to explore the world a little bit (because of culture and what I can learn from that).

How I help people is on a personal level, but at times projects faltered because of my demotivation and self image and I didn't finish them, because I let it go. Only slowly discovering that I can actually write, I'd want to help people and spread positive messages or explain things about problems to prevent or damage control for others. But the way to that point is really unclear to me. What can help me on my path? What should be my priorities? And this is an international subreddit ofc, are there differences from your countries compared to mine?

TLDR: Unsure guy, quite long after certification in journalism, can't get a job in his field since lacking work experience. What now? Vague wish to travel. Also: marketing/communication/SEO certificate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/etoau2/running_in_circles_due_to_lack_of_work_experience/,3,"I’m a recent grad going through this problem of not being able to land even an entry level job due to lack of experience.

If I had been applying for years and still not found anything then I might give up and either get a job in a different field or go back to school for something else. 

I’m not telling people to give up on their dreams but after awhile if money is getting tight you might have to take a job you’re not interested in to support yourself. ",2020-01-25 08:29:10

I changed my major to PR junior year because I realized social work just wasn't working for me. In that time I was so busy cramming classes together, working as a waitress 4-5 days a week to pay my bills, and dealing with a toxic relationship that I didn't even have time to consider an internship which is highly encouraged in college. I was taking classes consecutively that were technically supposed to be pre-requsite classes. Everyone in my classes had already or were working in a job or internship in our field and I just remember sitting in class having major anxiety having no idea what I was doing because it was all so new to me. I made all A's and did really well in my class work, but now I'm graduated with no job experience other than restaurant and retail so I feel like I'm dropping my resume for jobs and cover letters highlighting my skills within my field and it's not even being considered. It got to a point where I didn't even apply for jobs for about 3 months because I kept getting so discouraged. I've had a couple of interviews that ended in rejection and I feel like it's because I let my anxiety and self-doubt interfere in the process and wasn't able to seem confident. I've tried to make an online portfolio to showcase work I did within my classes (media advisories, press releases, campaign and event plans, etc). but I can't find a website that I find easy to maneuver because I'm low-key not very tech savvy haha. Idk, I just don't know what to do anymore and I guess I'm just looking for advice or someone going through the same issues. I know I can do the work but I feel like no one is giving me a chance.

86,f1wsve,False,Rejections,2,I was almost hired by a government agency. I didn't pass the suitablility but they may still be interested?,jobs,"I had a phone interview with a government agency. It went well. In a few days, I heard from their HR department that I was tentatively offered a position. I just needed a background check.

This is in a major city. I took time off work, went down to their office. I paid for parking and Uber's to get around to the different buildings to get the necessary paperwork done. I was given a tour of their office by my future supervisor and met my future co-workers.

Two days later I get a call from HR saying that I didn't pass the background check and that they are rescinding their offer. Shocked, I asked why and she said that the agency that performs their background check doesn't give details and gives them a pass/fail report. They sent me the number for someone to call so I could get more information. But their decision to rescind the offer was final.

I called the number they gave me. They told me it was because I haven't been off probation for 3 years since my DWI almost 5 years ago. In 3 months I would have passed the background check. Nowhere on the job posting did it ask about criminal history and when I filled out the preliminary employment paperwork I was honest about my DWI when they asked about probation. The paperwork did not state that this was a non-negotiable condition of employment. I felt bad that I had wasted everyone's time.

I emailed who would have been my future supervisor explaining the situation, including the DWI. I thanked him for his time and told him I hoped to apply in the future.

Almost three weeks passed. I received a response from him thanking me for sharing the details of not passing the background check. That the agency they use doesn't share their reason and just gives a pass/fail. He said that he's going to hold on to my resume in case a future position opens up. And while he can't hold the position I was applying for, he believes that I, ""would be a great fit for the team and would be willing to consider you for a future opportunity.""

I find it strange that he waited 3 weeks to respond to my email. I thought he has simply moved on. My other emails to him were responded to very quickly.

What do you all think? How should I respond, if at all?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f1wsve/i_was_almost_hired_by_a_government_agency_i_didnt/,5,"I would think he's simply had other things going on and got behind on his email. I work for government and unfortunately, I end up doing this sometimes. I'm only allowed to work 40 hours a week, I'm often away from my computer and not in a good place to write a meaningful email on my smartphone. Every two or three weeks, I have a block of time when I sit down and listen to all my old voicemails that built up and answer all the old emails that weren't about an imminent issue. (Someone they cannot hire to meet their immediate staffing need is not an ""imminent"" issue for them to deal with their current workload, like responding to you was when you were in the running. Perhaps he was just waiting until he could take the time/care to write something thoughtful.)

I wouldn't take it too personally - some people may be uptight about your history but many others will empathize.  I would NEVER bother to say I'd keep someone in mind for the future if I didn't truly mean that. Instead I'd stick to saying I was sorry about what happened, acknowledge all the work/effort the person made and the inconvenience, and say goodbye with a thank you. ",2020-02-10 20:59:06

It went well and when I sent my follow up email I got a response asking if they could contact my references, which they did as one contacted me soon after.

On February 7th around 8 pm I found out I didn’t get the position but in the same email they stated that they were impressed with my profile and offered to put me in contact with another director in the company looking to hire for a similar role. In the email they asked that I follow up ASAP so, on February 8th around 12 pm I followed up by email stating that I would be thrilled to discuss the role in more detail and would like to hear any feedback they had regarding my application but I haven’t heard back from them since my last email.

I’m a high-student seeking part-time for the first time ever, please bear with me if I say something amateur-ish. 

After talking to the hiring manager for fifteen minutes and “really connecting”, I decided to apply for a position at my local ice rink. The general window for applications was a span of one month, but I applied pretty early. It’s been 3.5 weeks and the application window closed a week ago. I haven’t gotten a response and tried to get in contact with him in person, then in email. It’s been 1.5 weeks, I still don’t have a reply. I asked a bunch of people who worked there and somebody said “You should a response in a week...” and somebody else said “Yeah he does that, I had to contact him a lot to get this job”.

Did I get rejected? Is it possible that they’re reviewing applications after the application window closes? I only really want to apply here since it pays well and I’ll enjoy it, but I’m just so anxious. I know I’d only know what’s going on once I can actually get in contact with the hiring manager, but maybe I can get a little insight from Reddit while I’m waiting.

In which case, it sounds like a boilerplate kind note to the individuals not selected to interview for the position.

If I were on top of my game, I would send this email out just to the people who I actually wanted to see again in future jobs, and then a more general ""thank you for applying but you're not being moved ahead"" email to those I didn't want to encourage to apply for more jobs.

It's hard to know necessarily what approach the company took, but if you are taking the time to apply for positions that are a good match for your skills, experience, and interests, then definitely keep the company on your radar and reapply for positions that seem a good fit. ",2019-09-29 11:25:46

131,dvydr6,False,Rejections,3,Job-Seeking friend faking Bachelors Degree & Unofficial shortened name,jobs,"Hi all,
We have a friend interviewing with startups and well funded companies all around US that has the background and experience to do well and this is generally the idea they get when talking with recruiters and interviewers. This is for sales executive jobs btw so we all agree they have references to previous employers that gladly recommend them for sales roles. This is someone who has done a few million $ in sales at minimum over a decade plus.
Speaking with this friend, if they said they have a Bachelors in Business, no one would question it because they can back it up with their knowledge and experience. Here’s two facts that is always a point of discussion why they can’t land a job with this recent run:
-They didn’t actually finish college but dropped out just a couple semesters shy, but their resume will state they have a Bachelors in the school. I’ll note they do have an Associates. It’s now almost a decade since they dropped out and continuing their degree would mean starting from scratch.
-Imagine their real name was Penelope Goldsmith, due to their name always being a topic and being misspelled they unofficially shortened their name throughout all social and professional sites and resumes to Pene Gold (just a random example!) In this case, thousands of people only know them as Pene Gold and only close friends/family know their full name.

So our friend group has a rising suspicion that their interviews are going really well, most go to final steps, but they hit a wall so we’re curious if HR people could chime in:
-In this case you only know Pene Gold, would you be doing research on Pene Gold? Clearly the name brings up official social media’s, LinkedIn with heavy references and all that so the person is real but do you run a background name check and see it’s not a real name and cut the process there?
-Would you be running their name in some sort of college database? Obviously their name is not real and even if you get their real name, I guess in this case it pop up with nothing or that they only have an associates?

We’ve been clashing heads on this discussion for years now and we want to ultimately know:
-Should they go back to using their real name? Pene Gold has no govt/papertrail besides what’s been built online.
-Should they ultimately just remove the college degree from their resume and LinkedIn? Or should they keep the Associates? 

TL;DR:
-Friend unofficially shortened name years back on LinkedIn and social media so now everyone knows them as that unofficially shortened name
-Friend puts they have a Bachelors but in reality dropped out two semesters early and only have an associates. Obviously tied to their real name which no one publicly knows.
-Friend is getting to final stage interviews for $100k+ Sales Exec jobs around US with a lot of interest but they all keep dropping off magically.

The position was an entry-to-mid level technical support position at a SaaS start-up. This matched my experience really well.

I worked at a voice communication SaaS company for five years. It was very much still a “start-up” when I got hired. Me and three others were the first in-house hires on the customer support/technical support team. I spend three years in customer support, then a year as a Tier 2 Technical Support Specialist. I left for three months in 2017 for personal reasons, but was then hired on again as a Lead Customer Service Rep. I left again in May 2018 because I would be moving out of the state over the summer.

Since May 2018 I have been driving for Uber full-time. I know this huge gap in my employment may not look good, but I try to play it off. I tell them my experience as an Uber driver helped me build my time management and customer service skills, and that it was essentially running my own business.

Because the team is mostly remote (I'd work at their actual office nearby though), all my interviews were over Google Hangouts. My first interview was with the Tier 1 Tech Lead, which went well enough for me to get invited for a second round interview. The second interview was last Friday. 

The second interview lasted for about 2-hours, again over Google Hangouts. I spoke with three separate people. The first was the Tier 2 Tech Lead, and I thought it went really well. He mentioned he thought my experience was a great fit, and liked that I expressed interest in growing within the company (specifically on the QA/product development team). 

I spent a lot of time preparing, and made a trial account of the service in order to get more familiar with it. He really liked that I did that, and mentioned most candidates don’t spend the time to do so.

The second was the Sr. Director of Technical Support. He seemed a bit reserved and that interview lasted shorter, but I think that may have just been his personality. It was half him asking me questions, and half me interviewing him. I came prepared with a list of questions. He mentioned my questions were really good.

The third and final was with the Tier I Lead again. That was extremely short because she had essentially interviewed me already, and she said she “already grilled me with enough tough questions”. 

She told me to expect to hear back by this Friday. 

Their technical support team up to now has been contracted out through Upstart, but they are hiring in-house now. 

One of their contracted agents lives in Florida. The hiring manager said they can’t hire in Florida for some weird reason, so they were waiting to hear if the person was going to relocate in order to keep the job. Then they’d know if they have a position to fill (they had two open, but one was filled during my interview process).

This morning, I got a canned email thanking me for my interest and encouraging me to apply for future positions of interest.

I am really disappointed that this didn’t pan out, and I really want to know what went wrong. 

Did I not have a key qualification? Was there a personality mismatch? Or did they simply retain the other contractor? 

I know these are questions that I won’t get answers too, so instead of dwelling on it, I’m trying to figure out what I can do to improve as a candidate for similar roles in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dbkga4/didnt_get_the_job_after_two_rounds_of_interviews/,7,"Sometimes there are several good final candidates but only one job.

It doesn't mean that you did anything wrong, it just means that either the other candidate was really good or that it was a close call and there was something specific that the other person did or said that made them pick them.

Timelines are always incorrect.  The rejection after your mini project doesn't sound too unusual either.  I've been a part of hiring processes where we've had to give three people assignments and reject two of them.

For the second interview, I will say that typically references are requested from the person they're most interested in making the offer to.  For companies doing it ""right"", it's usually the last step right before an offer, so I'm kinda surprised one didn't come your way.  To your knowledge, did they request your references as a final step? ",2019-10-24 19:27:27

Recruiter said he really doesn't get very much feedback ""in these kind of situations"" when I asked for some, but did say that there were a ton of other referrals and it was very competitive, and that he would like to stay in contact with me.

I have a JD, but have been unable to pass the Bar exam and feel stuck in purgatory. Went to a top 20 uni and I've been fortunate enough to be a low level employee on a few national campaigns.  Despite all this I've been stuck in an underemployed situation, which has just eaten away at any self worth I had. 

I've had multiple positive interviews, but each one has resulted in a rejection. A few rejections were personalized to my interview, a few have even talked about how impressed they were with the last campaign I worked on. As nice as it is to hear I'm just tired of this cycle.

I know I need to find a healthy outlet, but really therapy or anything similar is out of the question as I just can't justify that expense. I have tried it before and I just hated knowing how much they were paid with how little they offered. Maybe the third time is the charm, but it feels like a huge risk in cost versus reward.

Recently been interviewing for various jobs and have put a lot of time and effort into it.

I’ve had many rejections, but this rejection stung the most. I put so much thought, time, care, and initiative into this company and thought I’d at least have a decent chance at the position.

I was rejected, which is okay with me, but as long as I can receive some feedback and continue to improve. 

However, I was told that there was nothing I could improve on for the future, it’s just that I was not a “cultural fit.” Like what?

I’m trying to wrap my head around what this means. I thought I connected well with the interviewer. No awkward pauses, no “wrong” answers, and there were no questions during the actual interview that seemed to involve “culture”. 

That being said, this job was very competitive, so maybe I simply was good but just not good enough. Maybe they had their eye on someone else already.

What I’m interested in : what does “cultural fit” mean within a company and how can managers try to find a good fit during an interview?

Today is Monday, she walks in and is told by management that her assignment ends today and that her last assignment is to train her replacement.

A little over two years ago I was sexually assaulted while still in college. It's not something I like to talk about as it still affects me, but back when it happened it really... well, it ruined my life. I started failing my classes and had to postpone my studies - summer vacation came and I couldn't get a job since I was having constant panic-attacks and anxiety that was through the roof (I went to therapy for this, but that fell through pretty quickly).

Before I could get back up and continue (and finish) my studies it had been one year. I finished my BA in Literature and communications this June, and I have been applying for jobs since then with no luck. At first I thought it had to do with me being under-qualified for the jobs I was applying for, so I applied for lower paying jobs. I then got a few calls from employers asking why I was applying for those jobs, since I was ""overqualified"" for them. I tried talking my way past that, but they insisted so I went back to applying for the jobs I thought I would then be qualified for.

I have been doing so for a while now, calling in and trying to get an interview, and last week I finally got someone who called me back. However, they simply called to comment on my CV, and pretty much said ""You have a gap on your CV, and it's unimpressive"". I explained the situation then (without going in to too much detail), and while that made them a bit more understanding I was told that they had unfortunately moved on in the process and couldn't help me.

So... I'm at a loss of what to do. I can't explain the gap in my CV without getting an interview, but I don't seem to be getting interviews because of the gap in my CV. I can't just call employers around saying ""Hi, I just applied for a job at your company, and if you notice that there's a gap in my CV here's my mental history and why that is"".

I just need to get that first foot in, but I don't know how I'm supposed to do that now. And I'm feeling so distressed and ruined if this one thing that destroyed me two years ago, and has been haunting me since, is now also going to have an affect on my professional career. I just want to move one. I want to become a working part of society.

174,cwuhyf,False,Rejections,7,Previous manager won't give my girlfriend a reference - advice needed,jobs,"I am writing this on behalf of my partner - she's having the work issues but I am running out of ideas on how to advise her.

This is might be a long one so apologies for length.  Plus, I should add, this is everything I have been told from my girlfriend's perspective, so happy for people to play devil's advocate.

My girlfriend started a new job at the start of the year, as maternity cover, at a university.  Prior to that, she'd been at the same company for 6 years (interrupted by a year maternity leave), during which she was promoted several times.  And prior to that, she has been a longstanding employee at several other jobs.  I would say she is a model employee.

She left at the end of 2018, for a new challenge, and soon started the new job.  She was trained up in the role by the lady for which she was covering.  The role was, in basic terms, preparing for an event happening about 4 months from her start date.But after that lady went on her own maternity leave, my gf soon learned a few things about the role:

* No-one, other than the lady now on maternity leave, seemed to know what was expected of the role, in terms of procedures or outcome.
* The role was unique to that university - very few, if any, other universities have a similar role.  It's incorporated into different departments at other universities, so using another university as a gauge as to what was expected wasn't an option.
* My gf wouldn't have a manager for a couple of months, so she was pretty much left to figure things out, unguided, and instigate programmes and procedures for which she had basic training.  Which naturally led to errors.

So my girlfriend, for the first couple of months, felt undersupported and undertrained.

She then got a new manager after a couple of months.  This manager was promoted from within the university, from another department.  As much as I know about her, I would say she is a yes person.  Tells the bosses what they want to hear to cover her own back.  A jobsworth.

Things got difficult with the manager really quickly.  Errors started popping up in the run up to the event.  the manager would expect my GF just to perform tasks for which my GF had no training.  When my GF asked her new manager for extra support, or if she could come in on weekends or work late, to prepare for this event, every request was met with a 'no' with various different reasons.

3 months passed in the job and my GF had her mandatory probationary period review.  And in that review the manager tore her apart.  Basically said my gf was underperforming drastically and if the manager didnt see any improvement, she'd seek to terminate her employment within 3 weeks.

The list of complaints (which I saw) were insanely detailed and epically long.  Like the manager had been detailing every error as they happened to cover her own back, rather than try and solve the issues as they arose with my gf.

My GF asked for a meeting with HR, in which she gave her own version of events (no support, refusal to requests).  Naturally, as you would expect, the manager disputed this.  Which left my gf felt like she was facing a path of being let go in 3 weeks.  If she was unsupported in the run up to this meeting, why would she be supported in the next 3 weeks, in an effort to save her job?

So she resigned - she had my full backing to do it.  She wasn't happy.  Why stay in a job if you aren't happy?

&#x200B;

That was about 2 months ago.  My GF has since been looking for work.  She has had a couple of promising interviews.  One company was very interested.  Practically offered her the job.

They asked for her references, to which she gave several.  But then the hammer blow - 'we'd also like a reference from your previous manager'

I think you can guess what happened next - my girlfriend, reluctantly, contacted the manager to ask for a reference and the manager refused.

And the job offer was rescinded.

So my question is:  is there anything she can do in future (or to respond to this job offer that was rescinded)?  How can she broach this with future employers?  It's frustrating to think that this one terrible experience might hamper her work opportunities.

Or should she considered short term contracts so she then has more recent managers to call on for references?

I finished my Masters (English at a mediocre university) in May, during which I had a paid internship. They weren't able to spin up a job for me after I graduated, but they gave me a contract for a short-term project through them that ran out in mid-July. I finally landed a temp position that runs til February at an office doing stuff I'm interested in and getting paid well enough. I'm pretty grateful, even though it's temporary... It's been a rough, unsteady 5 months!

Going back to graduate school was a great decision as it gave me so much room to grow and try professions other than teaching and working in restaurants. If you're interested and it's an option for you, you could apply to graduate programs, and once you get in, do whatever you can to try and get an (ideally paid) internship somewhere and that'll get you going, for sure. Getting a master's didn't automatically generate a job for me, and frankly, I don't think the degree itself is doing too much for me, though it doesn't hurt. The paid internship I had in the office, and the short term project they had me on after it was over, has been really helpful in job interviews as it shows I have office experience.

I got an interview, after which they said they said I wasn't qualified, but they liked me a lot and got me an interview with their hardware team (who had no co-op position plans at the time) instead as this was more in my domain and they might want to hire a co-op. I was thrilled with this, and the interview went very well. They asked me for references and said they'd get back to me early in the next week. On Friday of that next week, they sent me an e-mail saying they hit a budget snag and would get back to me after a budget meeting the week after, and wanted to let me know in case I had any other offers or options in there interim. I said no, and that I was happy to wait, and they said they'd be i contact.

Of course, right after I sent that email, I got another interview (which also went well, but I wouldn't end up getting an offer for) and employer 2 said they'd get back to me the next day. This prompted me to send Employer 1 an e-mail asking when their meeting was and when I could expect to hear back. This was two weeks ago and I have heard nothing. 

Would it be reasonable to now give them a phone call and ask about the position, and if they aren't giving me an offer, whether it was for qualification concerns or budget issues? Or should it be obvious that they're blowing me off? The fact that they emailed me about the budget problem, instead of just denying me, makes me think that they would have given me an offer if there wasnt a monetary issue...but it has been forever since my last contact...but I also know these kinds of things can take forever on the corporate end.

I need some assistance digesting this. Recently I applied to the creative department in a company located in NYC. I immediately received a response, asking to set some time for a phone interview with the Creative Director. It lasted approximately 30 minutes and it seemed like I gave a good impression since she would discuss benefits and the next steps of the interview process.

A few days later, I arrive at the office within 10-15 mins of my interview. The Creative Director sort of sat me in and told me that our interview would have to be cut short due to a impromptu meeting they had with members of the department. I don't know this was this person was attempting to psych me out or test me but I told her that it wouldn't be a problem for me to have a 20 minute interview. It was fairly casual with her asking me the typical questions and me answering them and also showing my portfolio. Her body language seemed friendly. Was impressed with my accomplishments. She informed along the way that I am being considered as a final candidate for this position.

We temporarily depart and she informs me that she'd be sending me a ""test"" for me to check out while she was busy in her meeting. I didn't have to work on it, I had until Monday to send in it, and I am free to ask any questions when she gets back. I check it out but sit outside the company's office, decompressing.

She comes back and invites me for the second part of our interview. She showed me around the office and brought me into a room where she says I would work in, informing me that the last person who had this job left for another opportunity. I didn't ask that. She just informed me. I sat down and spoke to her for several minutes, showing her more stuff from my portfolio and she looked impressed. She told me to sit back and brought three more people from the department. I answered questions and showed them pieces from my portfolio. I took the chance to ask them questions because what other alternative is there? They laughed and answered with complete enthusiasm. I smiled. This went back and forth for a bit until I was out of stuff to ask and they didn't have more questions for me. In total, the interview altogether lasted about an hour and some change, close to two hours. At the end, someone from the team walked me out of the office and escorted me to the elevator. I shook everyone's hands.

I sent her a thank you letter because tradition. I did the job test the next day though her email implied that it had to be done on that day (while stating that I had until Monday). I did it within a day I was assigned it. Waited until the weekend, got a response today in the morning and told me she'd be reviewing it. About two hours later, I got the following rejection email from the HR rep:

I graduated in May with a degree in Music Technology and Composition, and began applying to jobs about a month ago after a busy summer. I came across a posting from a UK-based company for a freelance audio producer position in New York, which is right up my alley in-terms of technical knowledge and work experience. It may be worthwhile to note that while the position is in audio/podcast production, the majority of the company's business is \*not\* in that field.

About two weeks after applying, an employee (I'm not sure of their position) — let's call them Jim for the purposes of this post — contacted me by email with the following message:

>Hello u/iam_hexxed \- thanks for getting in contact, we're getting ready to move forward with this role, I wanted to check what your current availability was. We are potentially looking for someone to work with us in early October.

While I do have an existing day rate, I knew that a) it would be well under market for the area and b) that this job was a step up, and that I should ask for more than my current rate. After reaching out to some mentors in my field, as well as the r/audioengineering sub (see post \[here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how\_do\_you\_set\_your\_day\_rates/](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how_do_you_set_your_day_rates/))), several people I asked said that a key piece of information I needed to know was whether I would be paid via a 1099 as a contractor or as an employee before I could give them a rate. This made sense to me because, while the position had ""freelance"" in the title, it also listed several benefits that would only be given to employees (IRA contributions, etc.), so I didn't feel that I could infer the answer. Mentors and members of the audio engineers' sub also encouraged me to ask whether I would at any point be using my own equipment, which merits a higher rate for maintenance etc. So, early that same evening, I replied:

>Mr. Lastname,

>It's great to hear from you!

>I'm shortly relocating to New York from \[nearby city\], and with that slated my calendar is wide open — early October definitely works.

My question is, did I make some mistake in the process of communicating with this employer that might have upset them and caused them to pick a different candidate? Perhaps I'm naïve, but it seems as though they were interested with a back and forth happening, and then they suddenly went silent, five days went by and I got passed over. I'm pretty bummed because it feels like in following the advice of mentors (one of them said to me ""you should definitely ask if it's a 1099 before giving a rate""), I lost out on a good job opportunity which has been hard to come by so far.

TL;DR: not sure if something in my emails (see above) with a prospective employer for a freelance audio production job caused them to change their mind about my candidacy.

Note: I have changed some details to protect my privacy and the company's, but they have been changed to accurately reflect the situation (i.e. where the employer did not capitalize their name, I did not, and I removed my current town for privacy reasons)

206,fr72uy,False,Discipline,48,"My department restructured and I lost all higher level responsibilities, what should I feel?",jobs,"How do I interpret the following situation professionally?

Situation:
I work as an engineer in a small development department, up until recently my manager has placed me in a leadership position with talk of increased responsibilities.  I have been running customer teleconferences, driving the largest and most complex project open and have rewritten and redesigned a vast majority of our internal documentation, and trained most of the other employees all within my own drive.

Recently an internal  position for a sub manager was opened.  I applied and didnt get it, which is fine.  Instead  the position was split into two positions, and all of my higher level responsibilities were given to one of the sub managers, including the project I have been driving for two years.  Both hires were from our own small department and had the same title I do. 

My manager has done nothing to create a transition period, given me any feedback of my efforts up to this point, or any reassurance that this isnt a titleless demotion. I just showed up to work and all my usual responsibilities were no longer mine. 

I'm pretty crestfallen.  Leading up to this event has felt like a steady push out of any responsibilities I try for.  I have had meeting requests get denied only to be invited by another employee to the same meeting at the call of my manager, ideas vehemently rejected only to be later dictated out by my manager as his own.  He has a favorite employee with substantially less experience than me that he spends every day talking to about everything in the department.  Even while I was running projects he would never check up on them or talk to me about them.  

TLDR:  
An internal restructure leaves me feeling shafted. How do I interpret these events? Am I just jealous? Am I being a baby about this? Or am I just a victim of shitty management.

I'm located in Maryland; however, my company operates out of Washington DC. Some context but a general question at the bottom.

In late January of this year, I was placed on a 90-day PIP related to project timeliness and communication. At the time, I had been extremely sick for several weeks and had requested time off, which had been denied. I missed a deadline and a few days later was placed on the PIP. At the time, I was convinced it was a cover-their-butt, I'm getting fired move and started looking for new work - although I'd never had a performance issue or negative appraisal in the past, my supervisor and I don't work well together (she's an extreme micromanager and I've tried talking to her about how I perform better when I have some flexibility in process, but this hasn't changed anything except me just needing to adapt. I'm also her only employee, so I have almost no autonomy in my work, which isn't the norm for my position in other departments).

But after 90 days (late April), I ended up passing my PIP and was formally removed from it, with the feedback that I excelled at the goals set and to continue the good work. This was a huge relief - since COVID hit, I hadn't had any luck finding other opportunities.

In late May, our company advertised they were looking to fill about 10 positions from internal applicants for a new department - some would be a promotion, others would be lateral transfers. I've worked well with the hiring manager on other projects in the past and my skills matched really well to what they were looking for, so I applied. The interview with her went well and I was brought in for another meeting about it this week. I was incredibly excited - I love my company but there's no room for growth in my department (my supervisor keeps pushing back her retirement), and I want to be able to stay and grow under a new supervisor so badly.

However, I was told that I wouldn't be transferred or promoted at the meeting. Our HR rep was there, which I thought was strange. The hiring manager asked if I wanted feedback on why I wasn't selected, and I told her yes - that's when the HR rep stated that due to my performance in my current role, it's unlikely that I would be approved any transfers for ""some time,"" and that internal promotions would be ""very unlikely at any point.""

I feel devastated. I understand their hesitancy - on paper, there's no context around what happened earlier this year. But the tone seemed to be that I would never have opportunities internally because of this. I'm curious what bearing successfully completed PIPs have on internal hiring decisions in general, and if I should resume my external job search?

I'm more interested in the long-term impacts of the PIP at my current company, but if the info is relevant, here was my response:

I was scheduled to co-present at an international conference. Since mid-month, I'd had what I thought was a really bad cold at the time (I tested negative for the flu so my doctor attributed it to being a cold) and I told my supervisor that I wasn't sure if if was a good idea for me to travel. She told me I needed to ""deal with it"" and that not attending wasn't an option.

The deadline I missed was related to a non-exigent writing project that she assigned me the last day I was there. I fully intended on completing it between sessions, but ended up sleeping longer than expected while laying down to rest. The next day I told her I needed some additional time since I had little energy due to the cold, and she got extremely upset. A few days later the PIP was created.

I'll also add - my condition worsened while I was there, which I told her about as well, but she discouraged me from seeing a doctor and asked me to self-medicate since I needed to be present at each session of the 5-day event (she said something about not letting a cold be an excuse).

217,h7yuuq,False,Discipline,0,Concerned about supervisor behavior/disrespect,jobs,"Let me start by saying I like my current new job, I am a few weeks into a new position as an admin assistant. Myself and the other admin. assistant who herself has been here a few years, work together everyday and she was telling me a story which rubbed me the wrong way. Let me preface this story by stating that the building we work in requires us to escort individuals who do not have access badges. As a result, when the cleaning crew comes in each morning we are required to follow them around until they are done for security purposes.

She told me that once when she was newer, the bell rang at the front door and she left the cleaning ladies for a quick minute to let the person at the front in - mind you, the cleaning crew was still in her line of sight so it shouldn't have been an issue. The supervisor witnessed this and when she told him why she left the ladies for a quick second he yelled at her quite loudly in front of a multitude of high-ranking employees and said ""WHY WOULDN'T YOU TAKE THEM WITH YOU TO THE DOOR? USE YOUR HEAD, USE YOUR HEAD!"" \*while pointing to his head aggressively\*  My co-worker is soft-natured and this affected her so she went to him later in his office and confronted him about him trying to act like a big shot in front of the higher employees by disrespecting her and that it would have been better for him to have told her about her mistake privately. He apologized and it was over.

Or so I thought.

I keep hearing small anecdotes from her here and there about how he chewed out the last girl in my position when she would make a small mistake and how he's chewed others out. I guess what I am trying to ask is, what is the best way to handle such situations? If that had happened to you what would you have done? In my opinion, he seems insecure as he makes me do more of the technical work on Microsoft office since he is an older fellow (mid-50's) but, does not admit that he does not know how to do it. Instead, he acts like I ""helped"" him out due to his ""high work load"". He also acts differently when the government employees are present since we're contractors. How does one handle someone who could potentially be demeaning and rude at work? I do like my job but, I want to avoid being embarrassed publically.

Let me add to this: Yes, he is my direct supervisor but, the project manager is the boss for both of us and is much more professional in nature. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h7yuuq/concerned_about_supervisor_behaviordisrespect/,2,,2020-06-13 02:35:47

219,fwigns,False,Discipline,5,What do about tedious job routines? Any data entry workers here are welcome to provide tips or advice.,jobs,"Hello everyone, little back story, I studied marketing and have my bachelors degree, found a Data Entry job (37.5 hours weekly, no benefits) through a staffing agency after searching for a full time job for months after college, and now I am on my 6th month working here. I originally planned to use this job as a stepping stone to move on to something greater after getting experience here for about a year. I have a side gig of my own online business in ebay which consistently makes a little under minimum wage. Luckily I am not in any financial situations at the moment. I have previous experience in customer service, online ebay selling, and a temporary office gig.

After working at this data entry position full time, I am starting to feel stressed and not as satisfied working here. However, some of these issues are my fault from typo mistakes, language barrier, and already showing sensitivity to the higher position employees. If it makes a difference to some, this is a Japanese office and I am a mixed Japanese American, speaking elementary Japanese while my employees all speak fluently with understandable English and are from Japan which means work culture is very different here. I mainly got this job to fill in my unemployment gap, have better income, and gain experience. 

I have recently gotten the notice to fix my problems that recently happened (accidentely sent wrong report to branch and incorrectly entering shipment number a few times) and I feel that it is hard to ask questions if unsure about something, maybe I have terrible judgement or decision skills. I am not the smartest individual but I do not perform well if mistakes pile up. I am doing my best to not let these happen again but part of me thinks something else may come up and bite me later on. I have thought about what I did and have my notes to refer to, I am great at getting things done, I am very friendly in the work environment. Sometimes I feel that I do not get the same treatment as others if a mistake is made since I am not a Japanese employee, I get anxiety thinking about these small typos, email accidents, or anything the higher ups may think of me. I feel like I might want to quit soon or consider looking for a different job that may fit my background or be more better for my resume experience that works with my degree, but for obvious reasons, it doesn't look like there are possibilities of interviews or much employment due to the Covid virus. I am currently working from home so it lessens the pressure of demandant or harsh attitude from the higher ups. I am able to talk comfortably, get amazing support, and guidance with the younger and same positioned employees as myself since I have the least experience there. 

I understand data entry isn't that hard of a position from third party perspectives but it can get tedious, stressful, and exhausting at times. I am currently willing to double check more often, refer to my notes, and refrain from asking the group chat too much to not draw any attention to a small mistake since the higher ups will overreact to it and get mad. If anyone has some advice for minimizing error or working in data entry, please provide helpful advice for me. Any advice on quitting or value of this job expeeience? Thank you very much in advance.

Practically 0% documentation was left to me about the process; there were some instructions given to me when I asked about them, but those don't encompass the entirety of the job role, and I am now left to rediscover them again.

Manager has given me this role because the person was leaving then and nobody was more capable than me at that point, but right now, I'm believing anyone would be more capable than I would.

They expect me to live paycheck to paycheck and be able to pay rent when I’m working fifty hours a month and only making nine hundred dollars doing it.

223,e8nuha,False,Discipline,81,What I learned from getting laid off from a basic administrative assistant job,jobs,"I (26F) recently got terminated without cause from my former job as an Administrative Assistant at a student organization. It was a nice environment to work in, in the beginning (I started this past April). Then eventually I found myself unable to put up with the menial tasks, the below average salary, and the fact that there was no opportunity for growth/advancement in this tiny organization of 4 full-time staff members (including me).

So since July 2019, I had been looking for another job. I must have submitted at least 70 applications since July, for roles related to administration. I gladly used my sick leave hours and personal leave hours to go to job interviews. However, I kept on getting turned down. 

Shortly after, my work ethic at my current job was slipping. It wasn't even a difficult job but I mentally left it soon after I started searching for other jobs. There was/is a bit of egotism in me as well; I thought that I was capable of landing a better job than this admin assistant role, that I didn't go through five years of university just to be assisting others with no sense of agency. 

I thought I could keep working there while secretly applying to other places because I was friendly, cheerful, nice. I thought personality was still important. 

Obviously I was wrong; results matter infinitely more in the workplace. I was called into my manager's office and was told that they have decided to terminate me without cause, effective on the same day. They gave me severance plus vacation pay, on top of  two more weeks of regular pay. I didn't even care about that anymore. I packed my stuff and left that office in a daze, half an hour later. 

The next five days were the lowest I had ever felt in my life. I went to speak to a counsellor for the first time in at least eight years. I sent out ten resumes a day so I don't go crazy. I thought I finally had actual depression because I no longer had any appetite.

On the sixth day after my termination, while I was essentially sulking on the bus on my way to the library to send more resumes, I received an unexpected phone call from a director from the last interview I went to, before I was terminated from my old job. He said they've decided to offer me the position of Academic Advising Student Support. Out of all the jobs that I had applied for, this was the one I wanted the most. 

I was nearly in tears because I no longer had any expectations of life turning out for the better.  I don't have connections and I don't go out of my way to network — I am on my own when it comes to finding a job, so this news really turned my life around again. I start on December 16th. 

I have thought things would have been even better if the phone call came BEFORE my termination day, so I could have resigned instead of being terminated. I could have beat my former manager to it, in a sense, and not have to feel so ashamed.

But as masochistic as it sounds, I deserved some emotional pain. Otherwise I wouldn't have learned my lesson as much —which is that results trump personality in the workplace, and also do not let your job searching affect your current job in any way! It hurts to lose all your old colleagues just like that. 

I hope anyone reading this can relate and weigh in if they have experienced similar sentiment.

I said to him it must feel different to be an independent contractor than being a full time employee for another company because as an independent contractor you then take true ownership of your work. How well you do is directly applied to your name. I thought at the time that whatever I did as a full time employee was all just under the name of the company I’m employed by. He said to me that that’s actually not how you should think about work and I think he meant to show me that as an employee anywhere you need to feel like you are responsible for your work alone and that it always directly reflects on you and your work ethic whether you are a independent contractor or or a full time employee.

So my boss has a good history with me. My mom knows the boss well, I've been friends with his daughter for 10 years now, etc. Problem is, he sometimes uses my problem with gullible (As I'm still relatively new to the job (5 months or so)) to sometimes make a joke and ""humiliate"" me in front of my coworkers. 

It's all for a good laugh and I completely understand.

However, he sometimes asks me to do things that makes me second guess myself (as if he was taking advantage of me being gullible). For instance, he one time asked me to pour beer into an udon togo container for him and set it aside next to him. I hesitated for 3 minutes and was unsure of what to do, but followed through and poured it in. I gave it to him and he started to drink out of it. Strange to me, I thought. He said thanks and didn't say anything after that. 

Now comes, well, today. I am still new so I haven't fully learned everything about how the food is served, etc. I was not busy atm and he asked me to bring these two dishes to my coworkers table, as she was busy helping another table (I'm just a busboy, so you know). I saw that one of the sushi roll pieces had fallen over. I pointed it out to him and he looked at me all confused. I pointed it out again just in case he didn't hear and he said it was ""on purpose"". 

To me, this sounds like another one of those situations where he tried to take advantage of me being gullible. Turns out, it wasn't. 

I pointed it out one last time because I thought he was joking, but that was enough for my boss. He yelled at me saying that it's on purpose because the two sushi rolls looked too much alike. I understood why and said ok. 

No one had ever taught me that, that was supposed to be on purpose to differentiate the two. 

Later that night, after many of the customers left, he told me that he yelled at me because he ""didn't get to smoke for hours"" and ""it's hard working"". He also said it was in the heat of the moment. It was busy at the restaurant. I just said ok as I didn't want to further any anger out of him.

I feel angry and frustrated at myself and at my boss. I was either going to go against my thinking or go against my boss. I couldn't pick the latter, obviously.

A little bit of background about me. I graduated in May 2018 with a Bachelors in Economics. During my undergraduate years, I didn't go out much nor did I really pursue any real opportunities. I did not hold a single job but was involved in some of the student clubs so I had that going for me. I spent a lot of my years in my room playing video games (I still do) and really avoided anything that could land me an internship because I was afraid of rejection. As a result, I didn't have a resume up until my junior year and at that point, I still was reluctant to look for things. Time went by fast and before I knew it, I was a senior with no internship experience and literally zero job experience in my life. I did have some activities though such as some of the clubs I was in but that was it. Alongside that, my GPA wasn't exactly the best, higher than a 3.0 but not by much.

After graduation, I started applying for jobs. I knew I wanted a job in the financial services or tech industry. Initially, I was a bit delusional and thought I could land a solid job but my expectations quickly faded as weeks went on without a single response back. After a month of applying endlessly, I realized that the job hunt process was tiring and brutal but I pushed on. I used LinkedIn, Indeed, and all sorts of different job boards to apply and look for jobs. I tried to get out at least 10 applications a day before I went back to playing video games and this went on until September of that year where I would get my first interview. Because I had no interview skills, I ended up not making it past the first round. Over the course of next few months, this cycle would repeat where I would send out many applications and maybe 1 would get back to me. Sometimes even after getting back to me, I would get ghosted or not do well on the interviews. This went on for sometime and I started feeling helpless as I had to start paying my loans and did not have the means to do so. The only positive side of all of this was that I was living at home and all the jobs I was applying for was in my city (NYC). Instead of applying for some retail jobs to make some money, I was determined to land something I wanted and kept sending applications out mindlessly.

By this point, roughly 7 months had passed by and I had several interviews but couldn't convert any to an offer. I did start to get pretty good at them but I still didn't know why I wasn't getting anything. I was getting desperate and embarrassed and I eventually looked into my school's one-year MBA program. I was worried because I had loans and my family was in a bad financial situation. However, my parents were very encouraging and after consulting a lot of my friends and family, I decided to pursue it. I saw it as a second chance to take all the opportunities I had missed as an undergrad but I knew I would have to really try for it.

I'm currently a few months in and I graduate from my program in May 2020. I have attended many different career events and have done a lot compared to what I had done as an undergrad. I finally have received an offer a few days ago and it feels like a huge boulder has been lifted off my shoulders. The offer exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more happy with it.

I wanted to share this story because I know how brutal the whole job application can be. The last year had been hell for me but it did teach me a lot about the whole process. In the end, it really can be a numbers game and luck does play a factor. For those who are still out there looking, I want you to know that you're not alone. There will be always be up and downs and it takes a lot to push forward but at the end of the day, you only need to land one job. I know my story isn't unique but I know that some of you can relate and push forward.

This has reduced  slightly, however, he takes days off 'sick' frequently or days to sort out his 'taxes'. He always has a stupid excuse.

He barely does anything and is paid more than double what I am on and I basically manage the whole project for him. We've asked him to manage more but he doesn't. He's lazy and barely asks what we do and leaves early every day even when he knows we are busy.

The boss has gave him a couple of bollockings and he improved. However, the boss has left to go travelling and is working remotely so now it's just a small team of 4 including me. He has gotten worse again and has took yesterday and today off to deal with 'paperwork'.

In the past when we've called him we could hear that he was at a bar. I know where he lives and his local bars so I was going to drive over at lunch and have a look to catch him in the act. Is this the right thing to do?

233,eub13i,False,Discipline,6,How to manage anger and frustration in the workplace?,jobs,"I work at a tech company that seems to value a friendly workplace and a culture above everything. I don't have a problem with that, but this includes sugar coating a lot of issues at the workplace to avoid hurting anybody's feelings. And that I sometimes have a problem with.

I am a quite straightforward person who can sometimes come off as very blunt (I know it is a weakness on my part). My bluntness is not due to me being mean or rude, but just me wanting to say my piece and resolve issues as fast as possible.

&#x200B;

For example, a few days ago, a support person who was working with one of my customers seemed to be repeatedly emailing the customer asking for the information that they have already provided regarding their issue. I took a problem with this because first, the customer was a prospect evaluating us before making a buying decision. Second, the customer was a large enterprise company with a name logo. So my opinion was that the support not making sure that they have all the information before reaching out to the customer is making us look unorganized and lazy. I wrote an internal note to this person stating this and note verbatim was ""pardon me; I don't think repeatedly asking the customer to send the same information is very productive."" The note was visible to his manager, as well as my manager.

&#x200B;

I was trying to be as cordial as possible, but one of my colleagues pointed out that I might be coming off as hostile and accusatory. My thought process here is that I don't care. What needs to be said should be said. We are all adults here intending to bring revenue into the company, and I don't have time to care about feelings.

""I know I am going wrong somewhere here, and I'd like to know how I can change my way of thinking, and what is the best way to approach situations like this?""

Best thing to do I say, is stay in your lane and dont worry about other peoples fluff ups. And keep in mind that people are sensitive. That makes people dangerous.

234,ee6u3v,False,Discipline,16,I got into a fight at work.,jobs,"   I want to preference my post by saying I don’t advocate violence and outside of this experience I’ve haven’t been in a fight since elementary school. 

  I worked for Chili’s Bar and Grill for close to two years. I was indisputably the best server on the floor. I could take half the restaurant and not be weeded at all!!!! Very dependable worker who RARELY ever called out. I have an outgoing personality and know how to hold a conversation, so my guest and peers loved me!! But...then in 2018 came along the infamous 3 for $10 meal.

  Choose one non alcoholic beverage , a starter , and entrée for just $10!! That’s a great deal for guest, but terrible for servers. Due to plates becoming so low our turnover rate skyrocketed. Next thing I know my GF ( who I worked with at Chili’s ) and I working working most weeks with either 1 day or no days off. 
Now I know ... if I didn’t like it I should’ve dusted off my resumé and got a new job. But then again I have regulars who take good care of me and the social interaction at work was also good , plus the commute was quick. So I chose to power through these tough schedules , being the fact my GM (Older white man , Archie Bunker type ) promised the bartender position once he hires up again. 

  Well months go by , I’m still not a bartender and come to find out my co worker ended up being  promoted. I was happy for her cuz she’s my friend but everyone knew it should’ve been mine, or at least my GF’s . I wanted to talk to my boss about it but I knew he would just give me some bullshit answer. 
He gave me some bullshit answer one day when I pressed him on the fact he should make the servers work schedule because our supervisor who’s assigned to the role was abusing her power. She was scheduling herself and her brother good shifts , making sure they were the first ones out the door everyday. I was beyond frustrated at this point. 

 Fast forward to this passed June . I was first cut on the floor and business is slow. For some reason there’s not host on the floor , even though my District manager is present , but whatever . I see a party of four at the door so I seat them with myself. There’s the mother , her grown son , his GF , and their son. They just returned from the courthouse across the street and seemed upset from whatever may have happened over there. I tried to remain as patient and helpful as possible while serving them cuz it felt like one wrong word could flip them over the edge , especially the Grown Son. Eventually, the GS and his GF leave the restaurant. I was relieved cuz they were taking foreverrrrr to order anything !!! The Mother ended ordering sausages then sending them back because they were pork ....

I send my GM to the table to assist her. While taking their order the GS and the GF return. My GM lets me take it from here and he steps 2 ft away to the bar behind us.  The GF still ordering like she’s never read a menu before feels like I’m not being patient with her and calls my GM over and says “I don’t want his rudeass anymore!”.  And for some reason I chose to respond back saying “ well I don’t wanna serve you guys “. Then I began to walk away . The Grown Son then shouted  “ how bout you shut up you fat Faggot “ ... I was taken back by this. In my 4 years of serving I never had a customer be so disrespectful towards me. 

They’re just words I understand , and I should’ve just walked away like IVE BEEN DOING FOR 2 years now . But I didn’t sadly ... I walked back over to him. He stood up .. and I pushed him before he could hit me first. My GM grabs the guy and someone else grabs me. It lasted all of 20 secs with no one landing any good clean hits. I ended up being fired the next day for throwing the first hit. 

  Despite the negative things about the job , I loved it. And I wish I could go back ironically . So my question is it’s been 7 months now , is it possible to get rehired or maybe work for another Chili’s ? And is my GM at any fault for this , I felt like he allowed us to fight?

But the problem is I never needed an application or an interview for these jobs. Now I'm applying for things and trying to impress people I don't know, and I don't want my lack of experience in the formal job market to show so much.

Right now I'm struggling with asking for help. I've met some people at conventions who gave me their card and told me to call them, but I can't seem to find the confidence to follow through.

237,ei2pth,False,Discipline,14,Will I get fired (or someone from my team)?,jobs,"Some very weird changes are happening to the team, and I'd like some advice as to whether I should be concerned. It's long but will try to keep it as succinct.

1. We are a very small team with a lot of work. We have a middle manager, one big boss, and two junior analysts (one of which is me). I am one year above the junior-most analyst.
2. The junior-most analyst and I had a tense relationship for a year. The junior-most and I started at the same time, so they consistently perceived us as peers and yet consistently received worse assignments than I did. The middle manager and big boss didn't assign the junior-most analyst any work, leaving it up to me to manage them, but the junior-most struggled to take my directions and advice believing that I should not boss them around. The end result often was me being frustrated, and/or doing the work myself. The middle manager is well aware of this problem but refused to engage. The big boss is also aware of the junior-most underperforming (though not the management issue), based on various comments he makes in team meetings.
3. All this while, my relationship with the big boss was really on the upswing. He would call me to thank me for my hard work separately, compliment me on job well done (""I knew it would be just fine since you're handling it""), check in after business trips. He also seemed to become more open and honest with me, about his thoughts and opinions, took me aside to give me individual feedback. The middle manager too would call me to check in on a large project that was going haywire, thank me for job well done.
4. Long story short, the junior-most person launched an informal complaint against me and the middle manager for ""mistreatment"". There's no allegation of protected class discrimination, but the gist of the complaint appears to be that they've been told that they were a bad employee, that because of this they were getting bad work, that their relationship with the big boss deteriorated after a project gone wrong, and that they were told (by me) that there was a ""retaliation"". The management side overseeing HR complaints came to give me a talk on this, at which point I explained I never said any such thing, and the only occasions I can think of where that analyst may have made that conclusion are in the context of advice. If anything, I tried to wrangle some ""good work"" for the analyst but that effort failed because I left for vacation and no one gave the analyst anything. The management side overseeing HR noted ""hm, interesting"" but still encouraged that I may want to consider switching teams \[Edit: to add that there was the ""most complaint"" against me\]. The management side asked what was going on with the middle manager too, at which point I explained that the situation in the team is very toxic for a variety of reasons.
5. The junior-most person later told me about this complaint they filed but also told me, after this follow up, the HR asked her about me at which point they said ""things are better"" with me. The junior-most person confided that they complained about the middle manager too for their mistreatment/yelling/etc. and that they told the HR that the mistreatment did not stop as to the middle manager.
6. Around the same time, the big boss began holding team meetings including the junior-most analyst (used to never be a thing, because junior-most was consistently excluded), where he would make that analyst read out loud instructions for hours, while both the middle management and I were just there listening. The big boss began to be way more explicit about expectations and instructions, in ways he never was before. He also began to split up projects in the most inconvenient and artificial way possible to include the junior-most analyst (only to have the substance filled out by me, or redone by me at a later time). The big boss has also been making passive aggressive comments toward everyone -- especially pointed at the junior-most, insinuating that they were useless, and taking away their existing work and giving them a ""more important and urgent"" project.
7. At the same time, the big boss began to act very formal toward everyone and I sense a little big of anger toward everyone including me. This change is not very dramatic for the other two, but the most dramatic for me, as he used to be pretty casual and friendly toward me. He is formal even in exchanges that are one-on-one with me. He would avoid eye contact with me or engaging me in friendly chat in team lunches, unlike before.
8. The middle manager and I still have the same work, although the team is much slower now, and I'm not hearing from the big boss as much as I used to. The junior-most has no work. The big boss is unusually silent, although perhaps it's because of the holiday season.
9. The middle manager told me that no one had followed up with them regarding HR complaint.

It is clear to me that the big boss has been told. My concern is whether (1) I will be written up/asked to leave, (2) I will be kicked off the team. Why is the big boss acting so distant and holding all kinds of team meetings + breaking up work in such artificial ways? Is the company trying to retain the junior-most? Any thought would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ei2pth/will_i_get_fired_or_someone_from_my_team/,2,"Middle manager: clearly the route of the problem. Hopefully more likely to be fired or reassigned than anyone else.

Big boss: heard about the complaint and is being over the top and exaggerated in responding to it. They seem to be shifting things toward the most junior analyst, possibly to protect the middle manager over her. This is the one you seem to trust that you maybe should be wary of. But I don't think you're in danger of being fired by him.

Junior analyst: was and is being mistreated. It's unclear if she gave you a more honest version of the HR complaint or if HR did, but if you've otherwise had a decent relationship with her (and haven't been dismissive of her like some of your posts kind of imply, but it's unclear), it seems like HR either misunderstood who the problem was because of unclear hierarchy or they also want it to not be the fault of this middle manager. It's also quite possible she vented about each little thing and maybe HR latched on. 

If you've heard nothing else from HR, I wouldn't worry about your job, but I would look into switching teams, away from big boss if possible. ",2019-12-31 13:14:38

Acustome to tormenting each other in my.group of friends, a common one that comes up is I have an office job compared to their 'hard-working'manual jobs.

I enjoy what I do and have studied and worked hard to get here, but having never been on the other side of the collar I've never experienced what my friends do and how it compares.

With that in mind how do you guys perceive being in a sales position, how does it stack up in terms of 'working hard' in comparison to manual jobs, and why would this be something people bring up to me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e01ckt/attitude_to_work_blue_collar_and_white_collar_jobs/,12,"I've also worn both collar colors. For me the hardest part was internalizing the mindset/culture differences.

In blue collar work, you call a spade a spade, and if you don't like someone, you look them in the eye and say ""fuck you"". To do otherwise would make people call you ""untrustworthy"", ""difficult"", ""shady"", etc.

In white collar roles, doing exactly the same thing would get you fired by 9:01 AM. At first I thought that white collar workers were just good liars, I've since come to understand the difference between lying and bullshitting- misrepresentation of the truth vs. not caring about the truth in the first place. To me, doing well in an office setting requires you to start with a positive mindset, then filter facts & sensory inputs through this filter of positivity until they fit. This took me a long time to get the hang of, there's definitely an art to it.

As for getting ripped on for being ""lazy"" or having soft, clean hands; I found that pretty easy to ""own"", since that's precisely the reason I wanted out of grunt work. If you make a token show of your roots- helping a blue-collar guy at your company check the oil on a forklift or something, changing the oil in your own car in the parking lot- you'll get a ton of respect where it counts. I miss the joking and ribbing in blue collar roles, so thankfully that will never end. ",2019-11-22 14:00:58

We have quite a few teenagers working in the entry level positions. The typical age range for these employees are ages 16-22, with most of them only working summers.

The person I’m talking about is 18. Fresh out of high school and taking a gap year. He’s come to me and explained that he has trouble with anxiety and isn’t sure what to do. He’s asked to stay on throughout the year. I agreed.

This summer after he’s graduated, however, he’s gave me a letter of resignation four times. And each time he’s come back and said he’s changed his mind. I understand anxiety and making quick decisions but I told him it can’t keep happening. The third time he did it and I sat down with him.

He told me that he isn’t sure what he wants to do and thought it was best he put in his resignation, but then he changed his mind. I told him he has to knock it off and if he needs advice, he’s welcome to come to me, but we will find a replacement the next time he does it. 

Today was the fourth time he did it, and he told most of my staff that he was done (before he told me). He gave me his resignation and two weeks notice and I asked him if he was for real this time, and he said 100%,and I said okay, and wished him good luck. 

Not even 3 hours later, he comes back and asks if he can take back his letter of resignation. I’m not sure what to do at this point. He’s a kid, with a whole host of issues. I’ve been there before. A part of me is feeling that he’s doing this all for attention and so people will beg him to stay, then when he doesn’t (or does) get the reaction he wants, he changes his mind.

**UPDATE**

Today at work, he gave his resignation once more. I looked at him like he lost his damn mind. I told him to not bother to show up to his shift and wished him luck in his future endeavors.

248,emeu9v,False,Discipline,1,My co-worker is trying to get me fired.,jobs,"I work at the corporate office for a large gym and handle things such as customer service related issues and also schedule times for people to stop into the gym and possibly get memberships set up. There are about 10 people that work in the corporate office and we are all quite good friends.

The way my job works is that us workers at corporate schedule appointments/answer questions for the multiple gyms we have scattered throughout a couple of states. From there, if a potential client decides to go into the gym after we schedule them; it is completely up to the gym workers there. We just get people there and move on. However, there is a certain manager at a gym, let's call him Dan, who has been giving me nothing but a hard time lately.

The first incident was over something that wasn't at all my fault. Dan sent out an email to 3  people: My boss (let's call him Ted), my assistant manger (calling him Kyle), and me. This email claimed that I had ""yelled"" and ""cursed out"" an employee at their gym over deleting some of my records. I am not one to yell or even raise my voice, I cry way too easily. I did call over to the gym and ask why my records were disappearing since they were associated with that particular gym, and they weren't able to give me a solid answer as to why. And contrary to Dan's claim, their assistant manager actually yelled at ME, claiming she didn't do anything wrong. My boss talked to me and apologized on behalf of that ridiculous claim I received, saying that he had Kyle talk to Dan about why he accused me of such a thing, and he admitted it was their error since they were tidying up the systems (which is a part of MY job, no theirs). Also me yelling? Well we record ALL of the calls we receive, including the ones from fellow gyms, and the assistant manager who yelled at me got a warning for her behavior towards me.

I thought that was the end of Dan, but today I got yet another email. Addressed to only Ted, Kyle, and I. No one else in my office.

>***""Can we make it clear to (my name) that someone can not come in and set up a pass for their significant other? We need a waiver signed and if they have no intention of joining then we should not book appointments for a spouse to come in and get a ""free 5 day pass"". We book appointments with the intention to join (isn't wanting to pick up some paperwork for her husband to sign an ""intention to join""?), not so anyone can come pick up a pass for a friend or spouse.""***

However, once again, this was a false claim. You CAN book for someone to come in and pick up paperwork for someone at the gym. I asked all of my co-workers and they agreed that they have all done the same and have never gotten scolded for doing so. All they're doing is picking up paperwork for someone to sign ***with the intention to join***; there's nothing in our manual about that, at least nothing that my co-workers or I were made aware of. Maybe there is in the gym rule book, but NOT ours. If there was, I see no reason why Dan would send out yet another email to my boss, assistant manager and I only instead of calling me directly and discussing it. Instead he had to call me out. I don't see his logic behind it, and upon talking to my co-workers, they didn't either and all agreed that he was trying to get me in unnecessary trouble.

My boss didn't talk to me this time about it. He just replied to the email saying ""I'll talk to her"". But now he's out of the office and I don't believe I will be receiving said talking to. I think my boss knows full well what Dan is trying to do here just because he is mad that his previous lie got called out, however it still makes me feel very on edge.

I'm 23 years old, i work a minimum wage job for 30ish dollars a day. I'm miserable. Ive been blaming the system but I realize that will just end with me hanging from the ceiling fan sooner than later.

First things first, I like hard work. When im at work I work. No talking, no chit chatting, just me and my work. Im the fastest production line worker in the company right now. But my boss sees my quietness as a bad thing, and I have been passed up for raises twice because of it. And my coworkers dislike me, or rather ""are made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable by my attitude"".

I'm antisocial and anxious, speaking to my coworkers about anything but the task at hand drains me and irritates me. Is it so wrong to devote my shift entirely to my work? Will it really get me nowhere if I can't communicate mindless dribble to my coworkers? This is my main issue, this is what has actually led to me losing jobs in the past.

Second, I want an 8 hour shift. I dont want to work 16 hour days with a trade. I know people see this as whiney and entitled, but I have a family I like to spend time with every day. They make me happy and are the only reason i havent offed myself already. Is it so wrong to show up when your shift starts and leave when it ends? Will i really get nowhere if i dont dedicate my entire day to my job? Is that really what it takes? Is being the best damn worker in the business for exactly 8 hours a day not enough to be successful?

Last, I am bipolar. I get sick a lot. Sometimes i cant even force myself to stand up. And sometimes I call in because if i dont i will be less than useless at work and i know the only thing keeping me employed is how fast I can turn over products and i know if i show up and screw everything up im as good as fired. My boss knows of my condition and ""tolerates"" it. But usually i get snide remarks and unhelpful ""advice"" on how to be less worthless. Calling in hurts the company, i know. But even with medicine it's the only choice I have sometimes. It makes my coworkers hate me even more and hurts my chances of ever moving to full time again. Entitled again, I know. But if anyone has advice in this area, please let me know.

Im lost. I cant get my mind around these things and I'm so close to giving up. If staying at work for 10-16 hours a day is required, and so is being a social butterfly, to be a successful part of society than I think I'm just not cut out for it.

Last night, I was called in on my only day off (I hate that, sorry.)  because one of my employees was a no-show. We have a process where if there's no call/no show they get written up and potentially fired. It's a few steps. ( still, we're an At will State and it's in the policy so if corporate decides to, yikes.)

I'm worried. She's one of my best employees. She always is on time, does a good job. I recently gave her a raise and she was excited about that. I worked on Sunday and she switched shifts with me. She said ""Hey, I'll see you tomorrow!"" But then, didn't show up. It's really uncharacteristic.

What if something bad happened? How do I approach this? I've had employees skip out but it was usually just because they were being irresponsible, as I said. I just don't want to overstep my boundaries as boss but I'm worried she's hurt or something. What do you think?

Edit: Okay, I called non-emergency and requested a welfare check on her. I hope she's okay and that this is all for nothing. I'll update if anything comes of it.

Edit: I should probably mention she recently broke up with her boyfriend and she told me he was mad about it so that's another factor.

UPDATE: I got home from work. The police haven’t called me back. There’s a staff member at the shop, I told him to stay vigilant. He’s aware of the situation and is just as worried. I looked her up on Facebook and found her profile. It hasn’t been active for months but I still sent a message. Turns out, she lives in a shady part of town. Nothing to report from driving by. It’s like she’s just a ghost. I’m preparing to deal with the possibility that I won’t hear from her again. I have no idea how I’m going to deal with covering her shifts cause I’m on almost 8 days straight of working. Stressed. Some of you have suggested maybe she just skipped town. Seems unlikely but if her boyfriend situation was really bad... who knows? I’m wondering if the police checked on her and it was fine and they just didn’t tell me?

Either way I’m probably going to be hiring.

**FINAL UPDATE:** She got back to me this morning on Facebook and quit over text. She waited until Friday to contact me. Why? Because I called for a Welfare check.  She didn't give me a reason why she skipped work, cut all contact and ghosted me and our staff. But she was mad I sent the cops to do a Welfare check. The police must have done a check and it was fine so they didn't bother calling me back.

I'm not sure how this is logical, but I guess I don't know her private life. I don't think you can get evicted for a welfare check. Unless she's doing something illegal?

265,d0zac3,False,Discipline,5,"28 years old with BA, but no real work experience or skills",jobs,"This is going to sound long-winded so I'll try to keep it condensed. I'm a 28-year-old guy that's been NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) for about 1 year and 7 months. I graduated from college in Spring 2014 with a Bachelors of Arts in English. To be perfectly blunt, I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. I'm not good at math or any of the sciences, and only really settled on English because the graduation requirements at my school were lenient. My single mom placed an extreme emphasis on going to college while I was growing up, as she did not have her degree and never made much money. The main issue I have though is that I was never a very studious individual. I was bullied very heavily in college for a number of reasons, and I spent most of my teenage and young adult years overweight, depressed, and socially awkward. I've had jobs, but they've all been retail and I've never held one for longer than a year. My highest paying job was an assistant manager for a small pool store, which was just a glorified keyholder position that paid only 12.50/hour that I was let go from, mainly because my poor social skills made me disliked by my boss and my forgetfulness was making him lose patience.

The few friends that I have are all in jobs typically geared toward intellectuals. They're all programmers or in IT. They make close to six figures which makes me feel like a failure by comparison. The unfortunate side is that I've never really cared that much about math or learning skills. I just wanted a job that paid enough for me to live comfortably and afford things like video games or anime merch. I don't have any interests or hobbies that can be turned into a career. When I was in college I just assumed that getting a degree in any subject would enable me to find an entry-level job, but after dozens of interviews following my graduation I realized I had nothing to offer any employers. Sales is not an option because I do not have the social dexterity needed to perform well, and my appearance is not what I'd call ideal.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do to support myself for the rest of my life, but I get so overwhelmed that I shut down and do nothing. I know I need to focus on my diet, get some exercise, lose weight, and be on a good sleep schedule. I don't have the motivation or energy though. The only positive side to my situation is that unlike many people I know with degrees in useless majors, I have no debt from having good financial aid. I am not sure if going back to school for another degree at my age will be worth it, as I will still graduate with no experience.

Are there any entry level jobs that are just looking for four-year degrees in any subject?

Everyday (particularly when I first started this job), I would come into work and feverishly tackle all of my tasks in the most efficient way possible. Eventually, this led to me finishing my tasks way faster than my peers who were doing the same amount of work, but spreading it throughout the whole day by taking breaks, surfing reddit, or staring blankly into space.

Of course, I thought this would lead to greatness, but actually it seems to have caused me trouble. Because I finish earlier, I constantly end up having to take on other people's work and help them. I didn't mind this when people seemed appreciative (or my boss recognized that I was going above and beyond), but now it just seems like I'm expected to do it.

Perhaps the worst part, though, is that I usually leave at 5ish because I've finished everything. My coworkers end up leaving at 6 or later because they still have work that they procrastinated on. Because of this, it looks like they're working harder/longer (especially because my boss seems to value how long you sit at your desk over how much work you actually get done).

I then got transferred to another store to help. When I got to this store, it was BAD. Technicians lying around doing nothing. No safety policy. Doing bad, dangerous work. Since I have gotten there, sales have gone up, usually we meet numbers and bonus, and there is a noticeable improvement in the motivation and the work quality since I started there.

To add to the fire, my other assistant manager transferred without my regional knowing. Now I do not have that extra little bonus but am expected to work six days a week, some days alone.

He's now demanding I be written up, though none of my direct store management want to do anything, but as he's much higher up in the company they have to do *something* to me to appease him.

A little more background: I work in a grocery store in NC, I've been managing all the specialty cheese we sell but am moving to another store to work as a pastry chef. I spent half an afternoon helping out our cake decorator since she was very, very behind on her work and was off that day. A customer had come asking for a slice of a specific cake, as they were all on sale, but I had not seen any of that cake anywhere in our stock, and told her unfortunately we were out. She didn't seem angry or mad in the store and left, apparently to complain at her husband for it. I was told someone looked later on and found one of these cakes, yet our cake decorator kept things such a mess I couldn't find anything I needed to help her with and I haven't dealt with any of these products in almost 6 years. I was only helping because I had a replacement there for the position I was leaving. Also, as I was under an immense amount of stress that day due to a health issue, midterms at school, and having to go to my husband's grandfather's funeral the next day, I won't rule out the possibility that I missed the cake entirely in the back.

My co-manager said he did not agree with this, since first off a discussion point would be the first discipline used instead of going straight to a write up. Secondly he spoke to our HR rep who said that since the woman never reported it to the proper channels it's off the record, and also does not agree with the actions he was wanting taken against me.

Yesterday she pulls me aside and tells me that she's scheduling to the store's needs and that I have to work whatever she puts down on my schedule. If I don't then she'll write me up and if it happens again then she'll terminate me. 

Now the big issue I have with this is my original availability that I put down on my application was that I can **only** work evenings. During my interview she never stated that this was a problem. I was never told that it was a problem that I can't work day shifts. This is very ""all of a sudden"" that I need open availability. I assume this sudden change is due to my manager having to manage another store that is currently without a manager so she has not worked at our store in about a month now. But again, I was never told that it was required that my availability be open and she made it clear that me only working closing shifts was fine. That was when I was hired 2 months ago.

The only reason that I did not get into a further altercation with her about my job is because I have another job opportunity elsewhere and I have no issues quitting this job or, if push comes to shove, her firing me. But she has done this with other employees and I'm not certain if I should report this to higher ups for their sake. It's just not fair that we were lead to believe that our availability was fine, when it clearly wasn't and we're getting our jobs threatened because the manager failed to inform us.

I'm not sure how I should go about quitting this job. If I give my 2 weeks notice and she continues to schedule me outside my availability she might just fire me before my last day. I also feel entirely bad for even entertaining the thought of quitting when we're very short staff and our manager is working at another store. If I quit then my other co-workers have to pick up even more slack and I feel awful about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bpqs1f/my_manager_at_my_second_job_is_knowingly/,18,"There is nothing to report up the chain.

You didn't give your location but in pretty much every single place in the US she can schedule to the stores needs (which have changed since you were hired) and you can quit. That's the way it works. 

It's weird that no one else wants daytime hours because that's usually when people want to work so it's usually easy to accommodate people who prefer nights but the reality is that the business needs will always outrank your needs. ",2019-05-17 12:42:05

282,crduqu,False,Discipline,4,"Manager set up a meeting for ""Significant Oversight"". HELP.",jobs,"Hi guys,

 

Please advise on the below if you have the time. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. Also if you can recommend other subreddits for this situation, that would be much appreciated.

  I work at a big global company that treats their employees like total crap and I can’t wait to leave the job but circumstances arent letting me so far.

 

**Quick background info of the position:** Suppose we are Team X, we work with Department Y and set up projects. Then Team QC, QC’s our works, sends back the findings/mistakes and we have to address them. Then the QC team finally publishes the project. Now the job Is very technical and demands very high attentiion to detail where its just insane because its on TRIVIAL MATTERS. Like Department Y had it as “Troponin-I” not “Troponin I” - like seriously our clients are PIs and PhD holders - they will KNOW WHAT IT IS. I digress sorry.

  **For months now-** we have been getting VERY high number of projects, where as we are always at least 20 (small+big) projects behind (we're a team of like 12). Company wont even hire more people and will keep us understaffed. Company also has a high turnover rate, glassdoor reviews are mostly bad because of this reason amongst many others. The corporate greed is high.

Team X, my team is now fully staffed after months of hiring and rehiring. But the QC team is SO understaffed, and SO backlogged, its like 4 Team X members to 1 QC person, as a result, a project is now getting QC’d 2-3 weeks later, and always right at the publishing deadline. That means these guys are rushing and breaking their backs. Before, theyd publish well before the deadline and we could take our time and address findings. And as you know any rushed work means more errors. The errors come back on us though since we set up the projects.

 

Lately my manager’s been telling me at my 1-1 regroups that I have a lot of QC findings and been telling me that I should take breaks and not get fatigued etc. In my defense - we’re swamped and I’ve been getting high level projects (as in big ones) back to back! But anyway I don’t complain and I just told her I am trying my best. Luckily for our overall error review to date, I met the standards and got average number of errors as every other person in the team (like expected). This was yesterday.

ALSO yesterday:

A QC person had the publishing deadline for a ginormous project I set up 2/3 weeks ago. I’ve been doing my due diligence and working with her this week to address the findings. Then I left for the day, and it turns out one finding had 90 small internal elements that needed setting up - now on paper, the document we use - it looks like 1 line. So this is a common miss. She had to set up these for me and publish late at night. In reality this is an extra 1 hour or 1.5 hour of work even though they are using the number against me. Anyway I  hold nothing against the QC person though even though her manager complained to mine about how upset she was. Understandable.

 

Now my manager is setting up a meeting next week for this “significant oversight”

 

**Now here’s my defense/argument:**

Yes it was an oversight, and my mistake. But in my defense, this study went well beyond my own timelines because the department I was cooperating with assigned their totally new hire lol I had to spoon feed everything AND that 1 line error that I missed, required a code that was released like THE DAY I was told to complete no matter what (also beyond recommended deadlines). This one code was holding up the entire study. Clearly this was rushed and it was the last minute addition that caused this oversight. Its like that last piece of the puzzle at last moment - that increases margin of error ANYWAY for ANY situation if that makes sense. I’ll own up to this. Also on a side note - the noobie was so pleased with me that she's gonna give me an inspire award for it, it's like a shout out. Just trying to tell you guys I don't suck 😂.

 HOWEVER I will not take responsibility for the QC person rushing to publish and meet their deadlines and finishing this stuff on my behalf. The normal process should have been she has to send it to me.  I would have gladly programmed the 90 small elements the next business day. This is a company ISSUE where they obviously don’t give a crap about their employees. QC team requested higher ups to hire more people, and they got declined. And as a result of them being understaffed, backlogged immensely and rough deadlines, she had to go out of her way and address the finding herself. Like thats not my problem. My Manager is also trying to obviously guilt trip me using the QC person’s ordeal but I am not having that b.

 

REDDITORS PLEASE ADVISE. SORRY ITS SO LONG.

**TL;DR: Manager set up a meeting next week because QC person had to address a finding herself because it was her publishing deadline and their team is backlogged. The finding itself is fairly common, and is an additional 1-1.5 hours worth of work and I would have gladly addressed it the next business day. I will own up for it as well. My manager is guilt-tripping me with the QC person's extra work - that I will not own up to because that is the company's fault for keeping their team understaffed and intensely backlogged.

283,buvced,False,Discipline,11,"Retail Workers: Rewarding Work, just a Side job, or a complete nightmare?",jobs,"**To those who currently work in or have worked retail... what did you think about the job?**  
I am twenty years old and have worked exclusively in retail. My first job was Subway where I quickly moved into a Closing Leadership position. I was paid $8.50/hr.   


My second job I worked at for three years was at a Super Target, starting out as a cashier. I eventually cross-trained into different areas and eventually got permanently moved into Grocery with a 50 cent raise. I left the job a few weeks ago being paid $12.50/hr and started at just $10/hr. I was undergoing some career development but my leadership always fell flat on their promises. I was essentially a team captain for the department and I wasn't entirely favored over another guy who just leads with a bit of a better iron fist. I'm one of those guys who loves ""servant leadership"" and keeping morale and motivation extremely high. Essentially, I was the nice leader, and the other guy was the ""GET THIS SHIT DONE"" sort of leader who just barked orders and no one really liked. He was the same age as me.  


My third job now is working at a Costco that is being built and opening June 29th. I'm getting paid $15/hr to do this and my position is a Bakery Wrapper with possibilities to max out my pay at $24/hr in SIX years. I'm entirely hopeful I will experience career development here. I love the company so far, the benefits, and the employees I've met. The store is currently under construction but I've done my orientation, membership sales training, and working close to 40 hour weeks spinning a sign. Once the store opens, my hours will drop to a more part-time basis with the opportunity to get more hours so hoping I can get close to that forty hour week again.  


Anyways, what I am here to ask you is if you have found your retail experience rewarding, either spiritually, or physically(not even going to ask about mentally because we all know the answer..) or if you've found it rather dull, chaotic, hard, or just a total nightmare.  


I've always liked retail for what it is; the human interaction, the team, my co-workers, the customers(the nice ones), and the physical part of it where I am not stuck in a desk all day. I found it very spiritually rewarding but my first two jobs the pay was NOT cutting it.   


There were days where every single customer would look the other way if I said hi, or I got yelled at by a customer for something completely out of my control. Some days, a team member would piss me off or my leadership would say ""Hey, we're documenting your call in the other day."" after not calling in for months due to puking. Funny story, my team leader got sick with the stomach flu two days later and missed an entire weekend. I missed only a Tuesday and came back not puking, but still feeling ill. Things like that would happen that would make me question my employment.   


All in all, retail definitely has it's perks if you are not cashiering. I despised cashiering mostly because it hurt to stand in one spot all day. You'd think it'd be the other way around moving and lifting all day. I'm excited to be making a career out of it and I'm thinking I may attend college in the next year... I have no degree or real professional experience and in six years I could be making $52,000 a year in retail being a worker.  


On the side, I am an entrepreneur and run multiple side businesses that don't pay my bills but they help. That is my only real-world experience. I do have a semi-successful car detailing business that could pull in beaucoup money but in Minnesota, detailing cars outside only works when it's not below 40 degrees and snowing, so I usually need to close up shop every winter since I don't have a physical location and I ride out to client location.   


*How's your retail experience been?*",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/buvced/retail_workers_rewarding_work_just_a_side_job_or/,8,"I think that retail, at least at entry level, is great for extroverts who need a flexible way to make some fun income. As a source of your main income, it can be a terrible experience.

I never planned to work in retail, but I had to because I finished a master's and couldn't find a job afterwards. The managment, my coworkers and even the customers are fine. I haven't had any serious trouble at that place. However, going there when you know how much money and work you put on your education is an extremely painful experience.

I'd need to work many hours to be able to live independently, and my quality of life would be very low, as I wouldn't be able to afford proper housing, a vehicle, hobbies that don't involve retail or emergency savings. This is something doable for a short period of time, but takes a toll on your health in the long run. For this reason, I'm doing my best to get out of retail. 

Unfortunately, escaping this position means volunteering and getting low paid gigs on the side to built the experience for a better job. I'm working hard to get into marketing, but this is something that might take time and lots of $$$ that tomorrow I might not have. Entry level retail such as cashier and sales associate is one of the lowest jobs in terms of skills that one can accept, so I wouldn't be able to leverage my experience for something better if I were working full time.

On top of everything, I'm an introvert who likes some challenge. Constantly smiling to customers, asking them the same questions every 5 minutes, folding panties and price tagging bras is an emotionally draining experience.

I can't see anything positive about my retail job except for that I'm making a little bit of money to finally transition to a proper career, which isn't to say much as I wouldn't need thos job if I had succeed to launch as soon as I finished college. Retail provides nothing of value to me. ",2019-05-30 16:38:00

287,cfh6vu,False,Discipline,6,Not sure how to approach situation I was hired into (I'm a new manager and one employee doesn't respect me).,jobs,"This is a long post, but I'm desperate for advice...

I got hired two weeks ago as a manager in my new company (one position lower than the general manager). There is one employee in particular (I'll call her RD) who is very harsh and has an attitude problem towards me specifically. Turns out, RD interviewed for my position but didn't get it, and I did. The problem now is that she is VERY obviously bitter towards me for it and she is openly that way in front of other employees and even my boss. 

The problem is that when the previous manager was preparing to leave, she taught RD a lot of her responsibilities. Now RD has taken over and won't let me touch anything or really do anything that is part of my responsibilities. When I answer the phone she will talk in my other ear about how to answer a question I've been asked like I have no idea what I'm doing. When a client comes in to talk to me, she INTERRUPTS me while I am talking to them to answer herself. It's very rude and is obviously awkward for me and the client. 

I've talked with my boss (who I'll call GM) about it and long story short, he told me that it is going to be an uphill battle for me because she is still bitter about the position. He told me that if I feel the need to talk to her, to talk to her. GM told me that he will try to let us figure it out between ourselves, but if it becomes a real issue he will step in. He also made it clear to me that if I ever needed to talk about it or need advice I can ask. 

GM also made it clear that RD has had issues with the manager before me, GM himself, and even other office staff. He even told me that I'm ""going to make her mad no matter what. That's just how RD is"".  He also said that he doesn't trust her at all with anything personal and that if she walked out tomorrow, we would be okay because her job is just an unnecessary extension of my own. 

RD even admitted to me that she is ""a control freak and has to do things herself"" and that she had a ""tough childhood and that's why she is the way she is"" neither of which are excuses to treat anyone, let alone your boss, the way she treats me. 

I had the opportunity to talk with the girl who had my position before me and she made it very clear that my boss wanted ME for the position and that I need to establish my position with RD quickly. My latest experience with her happened today when I told her that she doesn't need to worry about what I'm doing because I can manage on my own (this is my second week on the job), to which she never made eye contact and responded with ""well I just need things done right"" gave me a slight look, and turned around and walked away. Which leads me to my main question that I really need advice for...

I have never been a manager before, and I'm even amazed that I got this job because I had zero experience in this particular field when I applied. So how the heck am I supposed to handle this situation? I have accepted that I will not be her friend, which I am 100% okay with because she is not a kind person, but how do I go about this in a professional manner? I need her to understand that even though I am newer than her (she only started 3 months ago) I am still her boss and she needs to respect that. And how do I reclaim my responsibilities that she jumped on to take over? 

TLDR; Started a management position and an employee that also applied for the job is bitter that I got it over her.

Then about 15 minutes later we started stocking the eggs and the supervisor walked up and told me to take my lunch break early but the way he said was, to me like he was relieving my more experienced co-worker of me helping/learning how to stock eggs.

297,bl1o99,False,Discipline,7,Toxic work environment situation. Is it my fault?,jobs,"I started my current job 2 years ago. From the beginning I noticed some cattiness amongst a few of my coworkers  and so had decided to take a stance of keeping a professional distance between myself and my coworkers so as to not get involved. I leave everything that is personal at the door in the morning. I do my job the best I can, collect my paycheck and go home. I make sure to smile and greet people and be cordial but otherwise keep to myself. 

In the early stages, I was able to be an unproblematic fly-on-the-wall, minding my own business, while those around me did their catty rants about each other. One coworker, let's call her ""Coworker A"", seemed particularly hostile to another coworker behind her back, referring to her as ""that bitch"" in a rant for going to management about an issue she had with Coworker A. I ignored it and got on with being respectful to both coworkers without picking sides.

One day, I had to go to Coworker A for some work materials that she dispenses to myself and my immediate team. Coworker A, asked about materials she had previously dispensed to me, and I said that was for [""that bitch""]. She became hostile and said ""it's not my fault you stupidly gave [materials to ""that bitch""], I don't have any more!""

I asked ""why is that stupid?"" 

She quickly backtracked, and said ""I never called you stupid!"" and went on a mini-rant about her suspicion that I will to go to management about her now (like [""that bitch""]) and "" you wear glasses and can't see"" (presumably the discord between coworker A and ""that bitch"".  I saw it, I just ignored it.)

After this incident I went to the manager after work for advice on how to deal with an unnamed coworker who seemed particularly hostile. Without naming Coworker A, they seemed to know exactly who I was talking about. They seemed sympathetic. They said they had several complaints about her but every time they confronted her about it, Coworker A denied it. They suggested I use my cell phone to record her next time, and call a meeting with management armed with that evidence. 

Over time coworker A's hostility toward me grew into mild bullying. She would tell me to perform my job differently from how I am used to performing it. I would politely decline and give reasons,  she would get upset and say ""everybody else does it [the way she told me to], you always have to be different"" etc. 

It escalated until one day she was ranting about me being ""stupid"" for not following her instructions on how to do my job. Mind you, she is not my superior, I don't report to her. The managers have no issue with how I do my job, and had Coworker A gone through the appropriate channels to express displeasure about the way I did my job, I'm certain the managers would have told her I was doing my job the correct way. But it wasnt about how I did my job, Coworker A  wanted to exert power over me and wanted to punish me for not being submissive enough. On this occasion, I was able to pull out my cell phone as she ranted about me in the other room and record her calling me stupid and making derogatory remarks about the somewhat prestigious high school I attended. She referred to me as ""weird"" etc. 

I did as the managers suggested and called a meeting. They asked me to describe the circumstances around the recording I made, asked me to write a report and I did. The managers agreed that the way I was doing my job was the appropriate way. I played them the recording and they heard clearly the verbal abuse from coworker A. Other coworkers were interviewed and the manager mentioned to me that at least one (not [""that bitch""]) corroborated that Coworker A is difficult to work with.

Shortly afterward, I was told that she was asked to apologise and she refused.

Thereafter. Nothing. Coworker A has since been a lot less overtly hostile toward me but she just ignores me and there is constant tension since I have to go to her for materials etc.  Months later, I asked the manager what was the outcome of my report and I was told that because I stopped short of sending the managers the actual recording, relinquishing control over its propagation, there was no proof they could take to the president and board of management to have disciplinary action taken against coworker A. So it's as if there is no evidence at all and nothing can be done, even though the managers heard it with their own ears. I was also told that the fact that Coworker A has a rapport with the president was also a factor.

I am left confused about what I could've done differently in this situation. Coworker A and [""that bitch""] now have seemingly repaired their work relationship since then and are cordial with each other,  while I am now Coworker A's number 1 enemy. Having an ""enemy"" at work is something I find slightly awkward and I wonder if there was something I should have done differently. I feel as though my biggest mistake was taking management's advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bl1o99/toxic_work_environment_situation_is_it_my_fault/,10,"I'm sorry to hear you're going through this.  It appears to me you handled it the best you can for the most part.  What I would do differently is stop going to the manager from here on out.  You've stated your case, you've shown evidence, they've done nothing about it.  

Document everything.  Every word she says and every meeting thus far; every refusal to give you the equipment you need to do your job, etc.  It is very hard and it will feel like you're reliving it but it is so important to do this.  The reason for this is so that if this place decides they want you out and you can't find another job quickly, you have proof of what happened.  You can consider filing for unemployment, or suing if you find out you have legal grounds (unfortunately bullying still isn't illegal but if the harassment gets especially nasty or there is other evidence of legally-protected harassment/hostility such as racism, sexism, etc. you might end up having a case). 

If you end up out of a job or decide to leave, consider hiring a professional reference-checking company to see what they say about you (something I should've done) and have that conversation about what they plan on telling future employers about you so that you can be on the same page when job-hunting if you list the job in your history.  

In the meantime, when she tells you how to do your job, go ahead and tell her politely but firmly that you know how to do it.  Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain).  She's not your boss.  Doing this with a toxic person just feeds the fire and oftentimes that's all they're really looking for is attention.  That said, it's a good idea to remember how dangerous people who have been honing their socially predatory skills since grade school can be.  Keep your distance, remain polite, do your job but definitely keep your distance.  I can't stress that enough.  Take the time to separate yourself from this stress outside of work and take care of yourself; sleep well, eat well and get enough exercise.  

Also if you're on Facebook there is a group called Workplace Dignity (they also have a blog) with people dealing with these issues in their lives.  

There are other pages on Facebook and also elsewhere online against workplace bullying such as the Workplace Violence Prevention Institute, Healthy Workplace Bill advocates in many states (I used to follow Massachusetts for example which posted many very informative articles and insight into workplace bullying).

Now that that's out of the way, down to business. Due to new management, our formerly flexible office (which allows people to work periodically) has turned into a hellscape where we're required to stay in our seats at all times. I do not work a job that should require this, as most of my work is done on a computer without input from other people. So, to avoid the noise, I often leave the area and work elsewhere in the open office.

It was on the calendar as requested, but I've apparently received a flurry of emails in my absence which I haven't been checking due to PTO.

I was never short before until Saturday. I also think it waa because I gave the Teller next to me 20's that she needed and she didn't give me the right amount back. I had the Control Teller count my drawer and my two other managers. Everything else proofed out correctly, so that's why I assume it could be when I helped out the Teller next to me.

It was also one of the busiest days of the month and I was kind of nervous. 

I just feel like I might lose my job over something so small. I did all transactions correctly, so it was probably transferring money with the girl next to me.

She made sexual comments about me through those messages and told my SO to come to our workplace to tell her something in person to ""hurt her feelings."" She told my SO she didn't have the balls to meet her in the parking lot in person. My SO has lunch with me sometimes and sees her there anyways so she decided to just show up like she asked. My SO made it clear she didn't want to get into a physical altercation and was willing to hear what she had to say. My coworker waved her down, my SO approached her immediately telling her she did not want to fight, but was willing to hear what she had to say. My coworker immediately started making sexual comments about me to my SO while I was standing right there. I made it clear that I didn't like what she was saying about me and that I was uncomfortable. She then refused to tell my SO what she invited her to come hear. Then my coworker ran to her car and called our supervisor. They asked my SO to leave and she did. My SO was angry as anyone would be, but wasn't threatening her and made it clear that she didn't want to fight. She's at my workplace all the time to have lunch with me and she goes to company events. We were separately called to HR and I explained that I wanted nothing to do with this coworker after she has sexually harassed me. I asked my SO for screenshots of their messages, and showed HR.

&#x200B;

The next week, other coworkers had heard/seen her yelling at my SO in the parking lot and asked her about what happened. She told other coworkers that we both deserve to die and that we should kill ourselves. She told the other coworkers that she wanted my SO to show up so she could try to convince her and tell her why she should kill herself/we should kill ourselves (but she didn't and ran to her car instead). I was then pulled into HR again that evening. I made it clear to my HR department that I wanted nothing to do with this person and refuse to even work with them. How am I supposed to work with someone who makes unwanted sexual comments about me and wants me and the woman I love to die and thinks we deserve to die? I'm willing to quit my job if I have to work with that person again, and I have informed my HR the same (I am getting training in a different department currently until sometime in September). They pretty much just told me that I don't have to interact with this person and that they hope I don't have to quit. They said they ""handled it"" and that I don't have to interact or speak with this coworker, but they are still making me work next to her in September. Doesn't that count as interaction? We would be standing next to or across from the other. They still expect me to continue to work next to this person once my training is over and I simply refuse. I just don't think any of this should be tolerated, and they seem to not actually be doing anything about it. To be honest, personally I do think she should be fired because I don't think this should be tolerated at all, but I would feel so much better if I could just move to a different part of the factory, I don't really have that option unless someone else quits.

&#x200B;

Maybe to some this might seem extreme, but I don't feel safe around this person at all and I refuse to be anywhere near them. Now at work I skip out on meetings (with permission for the time being) because she will be there, and I have to avoid walking through that area of the factory. I have to park on the other side of the building to avoid her. I have to tip toe around this person that did things that I didn't deserve. I messed up by not going to HR faster, but why should I be the one making all of the accommodations? Why is this being tolerated? I feel like if the genders were reversed, this would have been handled much differently. I feel like they aren't taking my concerns or feelings seriously because I'm a man. I don't think anyone male or female should have to deal with this at work, or anywhere for that matter. It's awful. If nothing happens on my end, I want to at least do something about this to possibly make it easier for the next person who's in this situation.

&#x200B;

I have found the head HR representative of the corporation I work for and the head of compliance. I'm considering writing an email to someone, but I'm not exactly sure how to go about writing the email or who would be best to contact. I'm worried I won't be taken seriously. My options seem to be to email the head HR representative and possibly have good results (by not having to work next to this person somehow), get lucky and hope a job opens up in a different department before my training is up, or unfortunately quit my job. Is there anyone else I should contact instead? How can I make this easier for the next person in this type of situation? If anyone has any tips or guidance on this matter it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

HR's legal responsibility is to make sure that the harassment stops.  It is not to make sure that you never have to be in the same room with this person again.  They cannot and should not tell you what they have done to your coworker as a consequence.

You do not get to decide how they sanction a coworker.  Emailing the head of HR makes you look, frankly, unstable and like someone I would not want to keep around.

And to those who say: HR is not your friend.  That is very true.  It's also true that your manager is not your friend.  The chief custodian is not your friend.  The CFO is not your friend.  Work is for friendly interaction but not friends.

Finally, quit having your SO contact your coworkers.  Things that happen at work are between you and work.  Again, it makes you look unstable and like a liability. ",2019-07-01 15:47:30

Everytime my bosses say they need me to do something, I immediately jump and work at 110% because I don't know when they need it by and usually since I'm so young, I might have to learn how to do it in the first place. I guess I'm more accustomed to the school kind of deadlines where if I am late, there is no opportunity to make it up where as in the real world, I am witnessing first had other people having deadlines to send to us but are repeatedly late and delayed. Any tips on not having 24/7 anxiety because I am in a constant battle against the clock in my mind? Almost like a ""it'll be done whenever it gets done""sort of mentality? Now I'm not talking slacking, just a little more relaxation. My one boss even has said that i dont need to jump at everything he says because he just randomly talks and says a lot. The few times I asked when they needed it by, they of course said ASAP but then several days went by without touching it. Thank you all very much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/96y97f/how_to_stop_assuming_everything_needs_to_be_done/,174,"In my industry, people often ask for something with the attitude that you’re already late delivering it! LOL it’s very much a “getting things done at the 11th hour” & “hurry up and wait” type of industry. I think doing things right away will actually be a benefit in the long run as the longer you are at the job the more responsibilities will pile up.... and it becomes a bigger risk to procrastinate... also I’ve learned the hard way that procrastination leads to anxiety... so you’d be right back where you started. So me the question is about priority. If you ask a “when would you like this done” ... every person will respond saying ASAP because they don’t have any concept of what you are working on at that very moment. I’d strategically ask your question about deadline in a way that also asks which is the real priority... so saying “I will get this done. I’m currently working on XYZ and have X hours more to finish it. I expect I can get this to you by X time. Does that work for you?” 
This will remind them what you are working on AND gives them the opportunity to say “yes that time frame works” or “no I need you to do this first”. Either way you get the real answer you need and not the generic go to answer of “asap”. It also manages up which is a great way to communicate your efforts without blatantly saying “I did This, This, and This, today”. 

Then with time you’ll get a real sense of what is actually pressing and what’s not, but always a good idea to manage up regardless. :) hope that helps!  ",2018-08-13 13:23:07

* Human Resources is not too aware of the goings on of the people
* My salary is pretty good
* I can pretty much be on Reddit all day and do absolutely NOTHING and pretty much no one cares
* I've been using most of my time reading and learning new things (I'm currently learning a new language, the course is being paid with my own money that I get from my salary at this job)

Still even while having all this pros...I still feel like I want to just quit and find something else, even if its the complete opposite as long as I actually like what I do.

I've been going to therapy and been trying to figure out why I just can't be like most people who just stay in their job as long as it pays well. Most of my friends are like that.

327,bz3xih,False,Discipline,2,I hate my job and don't know what to do,jobs,"(Please note this is my first post in reddit ever, so if I put this in the wrong place please tell me! Thank you!)

Alright straight to the point, I HATE my job.  As a college student, I thought I'd lucked out getting a retail job for this company (a world wide and pretty expensive cosmetics company).  The job was nothing special, just your basic helping people find their stuff, cashiering, stocking, and the likes.  Or at least I thought it was.  

So everything was going really well, I even got a ""promotion"" and was able to take on more responsibility, which I enjoyed.  I was constantly asking what I could do to improve, what I needed to work on, or if my manager needed any help with anything.  Everything was fine until I had to request time off in order to complete my last semester at college before I could move onto a University.  Trying to finish off classes is normally hard enough, but during this time my parents were always fighting and seriously considering getting a divorce.  Add on top of that the fact I can only go to college if I keep my grades up, as I rely only on scholarships.  You could say I was just a *little* stressed out at the time.  Scheduling for this place has always been bad.  The manager would make it one week in advance, your never allowed to switch shifts with someone else, and in order to get time off you have to request it a month in advance.  So anyways, I told my acting manager (he's actually the assistant, but because the stores real manager broke her leg and couldn't work for a long time, we as the staff filled out a survey which got him temporarily promoted) about everything that was going on with school.  It should be noted that while I didn't love the manager (I actually thought he was and still is super child-ish.  He refuses to take any criticism, is rude, and is super 'car sales man' like to the costumers), the two of us had a pretty good relationship.  At this point, we'd only really only had a one on one when I expressed how much I hated the new sales tactic we were using (basically continuously bothering costumers in every section of the store, even if they asked us to go away).  

So I tell him the issues with needing more time for school and he assures me he will do everything he can.  Next schedule comes out and guess what?  I'm scheduled for MORE hours!  I was pissed, we had another meeting where he tried to tell me ""I did do everything I could, this is less hours, I don't know what you want me to do.  Besides, you only go to school four days a week, you should have plenty of time to work here.""  I had to explain to this man how even though I go to school four days a week, the work load required for my classes was that of a full time job.  So even though it seemed like I had all the time in the world, in reality I was spending hours upon hours a day trying to figure out homework and getting tutored.  Eventually, my manager said he understood and agreed to let me give up one of my shifts.  I was still pissed, but I eventually was able to graduate so my availability became free again.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.  So, our real manager finally got cleared to come back to the store, and within about two weeks of being back she pulls me into a meeting with the supervisor I'd been working with thanks to my promotion.  They tell me I'm basically de-promoted because of my availability and because the old manager (now the assistant manager or AM) and my supervisor thought it was taking away my commitment on the sales floor.  She also told me the amount of time I had taken off because I was sick or for family emergencies was unacceptable and if I missed another shift I'd be fired.  I was in shock.  That promotion was everything to me, and to make matters worse my supervisor in that position told me they were still ""so thankful for all the work I did and the new organizational systems I had created.  In fact, there so great will still be using them.""  I'm sure they meant well by saying this, but all I could here was ""thanks for fixing everything, but you're useless now so bye!""  On top of that, I even checked with both my supervisor and AM if my availability would affect my promotion, and they both assured me as soon as my hours became open again I could go right back too it.  I ended up having to be sent home that day because I had a break down.  

At this point I just don't know what to do.  I am so upset about the fact they took away my position (I was able to work behind the scenes more and was insured longer hours).  Honestly, what makes everything so much worse was that I never heard anything but positivity in that position.  They never told me I was doing anything wrong, and never gave me things to improve on.  At this point, I know I worst case scenario I will need this job until the summer ends.  Its only a couple of month but with how much I hate this place it might as well be a century.

So, I have 4 employees right now. Had 5, but one left already due to the employees having near-daily arguments.

I leave them alone for one minute and they start fighting. I don’t have the ability to constantly watch them, or anyone else I would trust to do so. 

We already had a two-hour long discussion on it, which helped for one day. Great waste of time when we’re already weeks behind schedule.

I’m at a loss. Tbh they’re from a temp agency and I’m pretty much done with them and the agency once I manage to hire more direct employees. They also seldom do a good job, deliberately choose to not follow directions (have a way they think is better), and they call in once a week. Right now I need the help though.

332,ak9yiw,False,Discipline,19,"My coworker went through my email on at least 2 occasions and forwarded herself a few of my emails, I am conflicted on what to do about it",jobs,"A little background info : I work for a big health care company. I work in one of their medical offices and in my job I interact with many patients a day and I have access to their medical information and have to chart. We have a lot of computers in our department and we use those computers to chart patient info as well as do many other things. My job gives every employee a username and password to log onto windows and that same information is used to log onto our work emails. On certain computers when you log onto windows, you can simply click on the email application and it will open up your work email without entering in a password again.  For my position, there are 2 computers that are primarily used among my coworkers and I, one of those computers i set up to that once we log onto windows, our email will open without needed to enter a password.

So, a few days ago I was logged onto one of the computers because I was working on that computer, i never logged off because i was going back and forth from that room and it takes minutes to log back on. One of my coworkers had come in for a shift for the second half of our day. When she came in she was assigned to work in the room I was originally working in, the one that I was logged on the computer. A few minutes after she had clocked in I went to that room to tell her something and i saw the computer screen was on my email page(I realized i had left my email open because the last time i used it the webpage froze on me and i never got to close it). When my coworker saw me she got startled and made some bs about how she thought she was logged into her email and then said ""i will log you out right now"" I was suspicious when that happened but didn't think anything of it and just assumed she would log me out since she said she would. That day passed and when i came into work the next day I opened my email to respond to a message I was having with a union representative, when i opened the email somewhere at the top of the email it said ""you forwarded this email at 2:06 on January 24th"" When I saw that i right away realized something was fishy, i looked through my sent and deleted boxes and nothing was in there. Much to my luck, our email system allows us to recover deleted emails within 30 days and that option popped up and low and behold i recovered 2 deleted emails. Both of those emails were emails I had with a union representative in regards to my job and both of those emails were forwarded to my coworker who was using my  computer and had my email open when i walked in. One of those emails was sent a week before the other, one on January 18th and one on the 24th. On top of that, this girl had to really look through my email to find these conversations. The first one she forwarded was in my sent box so she had to have looked literally through everything. 

I have no clue how to handle this situation: I have a few options: 1. Would be to report her for doing what she did but i'm certain she would get fired. 2. I confront her about what she did and tell her she was wrong and to never do it again to me or anything else, and just ask her how she would feel if someone did this to her etc etc. 

I understand that people can be curious and maybe if they see someones email open they might read what they see on the page (although this is wrong either way), this girl did way more than that she went through many of my emails to find these emails and she freaking sent them to her self. I don't dislike this person and although i would never ever trust them, i dont no if i feel comfortable reporting them because they might lose their job. However, I am conflicted because my job does require us to report certain things to compliance, for example if my coworker was accessing my medical chart or another coworkers chart she would have to be reported right away. However, I don't know if accessing my emails falls under the same category(of course her doing this is still extremely unethical).

What would you guys do if this happened to you? What do you guys think I should do? Will talking to her be enough for her to never do this again or will it simply make our work situation hostile.

* Yelled at for purchasing a drink during my shift (again, 3 hours with no break) after I forgot to bring one, which is fine, but it took longer to lecture me about it than it did for me to buy the drink
* Told that ""heads will roll"" if I did the wrong thing

This requires me to be meticulous and track every hour - one day, I sent them a time log with only 7.25 hours recorded and said, “hey, I don’t know where the time actually belongs, I’ve been in the office for 8.5 hours and I’m sure it was used to send emails etc.”

I then received an email that “all 8 hours need to be recorded and I’ve also heard that using your phone at your desk is still a problem” (not saying it’s 100% ok to be on the phone in the office, but I take 5 minute breaks to clear my mind; my coworker spies on me and reports my actions, also if I talk to other coworkers ‘too much’).  Side note, you will be billed for all my hours I am in the office, minus lunch, even if I’m getting a coffee or going to the bathroom. Period.

Well, it’s been 4 months of this. My boss has been on maternity leave for the last two but I have to keep submitting them to my spying coworker. I want to breach the subject of no longer doing these - it’s so demoralizing and I just dread coming into the office. Further, if I work on 3 things at once, sometimes it’s 5 minutes here, 15 there, then back to a different project. It’s wasting more time for me to write down every movement than .... I don’t know.

I feel burnt out. Sad. Can’t get my thoughts together. I just don’t want to do these lists anymore. I’ve thought about just refusing but I can’t until I have a solidified back up plan. And that’s anywhere from 2 weeks to 7 months away.

 I just got hired about a month ago. I was never on the actual printed schedule or the one in the system, so I was mostly working undocumented hours (but I knew all the hours I work). One day at the end of my ""shift"", I asked one of the managers in store to put me on the schedule for the next week. I asked him how to figure out what days I had to work and he just told me to talk to the hiring manager. I texted her (twice, because she left my 1st message on Read) and on Saturday she told me that the schedule for ""this week"" is already done and that she would make sure I was on NEXT week's schedule. I assumed that ""this week""  was the schedule for the next week (the days after that Saturday in which she texted me back) and that I would have to wait a whole week to get back to work. I did not text her back because she was adamant about how she did not read texts when she was not working, and seeing as how she was my boss, I did not want to get her any angrier. So now I just missed a day of work and I did not know. The hiring manager texted me back and told me that I missed my shift and said that ""whenever you need to find out your schedule, call the store on Thursdays and Fridays"". It would have been great to know that in the last text you sent me. Will I get fired for this?

338,7x01ze,False,Discipline,56,"My boss tried to pressure me to come into work, at a restaurant, while I have the flu.",jobs,"This flu epidemic is scary. Last I saw over 70 people have died of it. I work in a franchise diner, as a server, and many of our customers are elderly people. I think it could be extremely irresponsible to put people at risk of getting sick, not to mention putting myself at risk by working night shifts on my feet for 8-10 hours while I'm really sick.

I told her initially that I was afraid I might have caught the flu, and I missed one shift. I had the following three days scheduled off, so I told her that if I wasn't feeling better by my next scheduled shift, I would get a doctor's note. 

I called the afternoon before my next overnight shift, and told them that I was definitely sick, it definitely felt like the flu, and that I'd be going to the doctor ASAP. I asked if I could bring the note in tomorrow, and she immediately got irritated with me, and said that if I didn't bring in my doctor's note before my shift that night, I'd be fired. I told her I'd try to get one today, but either way I didn't think it would be reasonable for me to come in coughing and sneezing, and serve people food and prepare their desserts, etc. She said that's not a good enough excuse, and that I should just come in because ""that's what everyone has to do even if they don't feel good."" She said unless I have a fever, it just sounds like a lot of excuses. 

So I spent 5 hours in the ER on Friday, while they were insanely busy specifically because of the flu. Got a flu test (positive), and they wrote me a note saying that I'd been seen, and had the flu. I immediately drove to work, gave them the note and they said, ""Okay, so you'll be back tomorrow?"" I said no, guys, I have the flu. You are absolutely not supposed to work in food service if you have the flu, especially during an epidemic. 

I spoke to my boss again and she said that if I'm going to miss any more work, I need another note from a doctor saying when I'm cleared to come back to work. My boyfriend had our only vehicle and was working, so I took a bus to the ER, waited a few hours, explained my situation, and they wrote my a note clearly stating that I have been diagnosed with the flu and will not be cleared to work until after the 15th, and if get worse or get a fever, add another 24 hours to that. 

I understand that it's hard for her because I'm fairly new, and she has to have someone fill in for me, but I think it's entirely unethical for her to guilt and pressure me to work when I could infect other people or worsen my own condition. What if I infect my other coworkers and then we all miss work? We do not have any kind of sick leave, so she would be screwed and so would we (I'm surviving right now because I made my serving tips last, and my boyfriend just got his tax return. But I have not earned money this week.) 

She seems to just generally have a bad attitude with me now, and while the assistant managers still like me, she's the general manager so her word is it. I have the experience, should I be looking at other jobs? I feel like there's just going to be a bad environment there now, and my other co-workers all seem to be intimidated by her also. She also only writes schedules one week at a time, and writes each schedule the day before it starts, so it's really stressful trying to plan anything unless I know about it in enough time to put in for the days off. 

TLDR : My boss is kind of unprofessional and rude, and pressured me to serve people food while I have the flu. She seemingly does this a lot, and people don't ever stand up to her because it's just a franchise diner and they probably know they can be replaced. 

Has anyone had experience with this? It seems unprofessional, and maybe even against company policy (though she didn't give me an employee handbook so I'm not sure). What would I tell my next employer about why I quit this job? Would it come off like I was just whining and had bad attendance? 

UPDATE: My boss now says that the 2nd note I brought her, stating that I was cleared to work again the 15th, does not have the proper letterhead from the hospital (it was written by a nurse) and I'd need to get another note before I can come back. I told her I don't have my car right now, and I think it's pretty unreasonable of her to ask me to take a bus, in the cold, while I'm sick, back to the ER for a non-emergency, just to ask them for a better note when she could just call the number they provided on the note if she has any questions.

One example is the night time manager asking for more hours to give employees because it was just too unpredictable and we were understaffed but he basically said he didn’t want to pay for the extra hours. Additionally, I heard that our director is actually paying the bills; not the owner. I assume he just gives her access to some billing account and makes her do it. Lastly, the best evidence I have is that our store is horribly under average in nearly every area and most of my coworkers are good employees in my opinion.

Before I went on holiday my manager asked me to sign something in her name and send off once she’d had a read through as she was on holiday that day. 

I waited for the go ahead, nothing so I text her as she was at the airport if she’d managed to read it so I can sign and send and I got no response. I even waited an hour after work in case she messaged then. Still nothing but I had to leave to pack and go to the airport and couldn’t wait longer.

341,bua96k,False,Discipline,3,"NEET, about to turn 28. Degree, but no real work experience or skills.",jobs,"This is going to sound long-winded so I'll try to keep it condensed. I'm a 27-year-old guy, two months away from turning 28. I've been NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) for about 1 year and 7 months. I graduated from college in Spring 2014 with a Bachelors of Arts in English. Truth be told, I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. I'm not good at math or any of the sciences, and only really settled on English because the graduation requirements at my school were lenient. My single mom placed an extreme emphasis on going to college while I was growing up, as she did not have her degree and never made much money. The main issue I have though is that I was never a very studious individual. I was bullied very heavily in college for a number of reasons, and I spent most of my teenage and young adult years overweight, depressed, and socially awkward. I've had jobs, but they've all been retail and I've never held one for longer than a year. My highest paying job was an assistant manager for a small pool store, which was just a glorified keyholder position that paid only 12.50/hour that I was let go from, mainly because my poor social skills made me disliked by my boss and my forgetfulness was making him lose patience.

The few friends that I have are all in jobs typically geared toward intellectuals. They're all programmers or in IT. They make close to six figures which makes me feel like a failure by comparison. The unfortunate side is that I've never really cared that much about math or learning skills. I just wanted a job that paid enough for me to live comfortably and afford things like video games or anime merch. I don't have any interests or hobbies that can be turned into a career. When I was in college I just assumed that getting a degree in any subject would enable me to find an entry-level job, but after dozens of interviews following my graduation I realized I had nothing to offer any employers. Sales is not an option because I do not have the social dexterity needed to perform well, and my appearance is not what I'd call ideal.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do to support myself for the rest of my life, but I get so overwhelmed that I shut down and do nothing. I know I need to focus on my diet, get some exercise, lose weight, and be on a good sleep schedule. I don't have the motivation or energy though. The only positive side to my situation is that unlike many people I know with degrees in useless majors, I have no debt from having good financial aid. I am not sure if going back to school for another degree at my age will be worth it, as I will still graduate with no experience.

343,bamekw,False,Discipline,4,My boss is going too far.,jobs,"TL;DR: My brother and me work at the same job. But because he's had less experience than me, my boss is very harsh on my brother and gets him in trouble at the smallest, dumbest things that arent even that big, and are stuff that i do a lot. He's threatening to fire him for dumb reasons, and I've told my boss ill leave too if that happens. But this job has been good to me.


I really need advice on a current situation that I'm in, because I'm not exactly sure how to go about it.

I'm in highschool, and about a month ago, I started a job as a receptionist for a barbershop. Its been quite decent; the environment is friendly, the co-workers are nice, and I can handle it pretty well. Most of all, the boss is really proud of my work. I've been trained well, so I knew what to do by the fourth day. I've never had a job prior, but I have had experience with dealing with customers due to volunteering at multiple places. 

Two weeks pass, and my brother requests to work as well since he's in need of experience. He's only a year below me, but his personality is a bit different. He's more timid, shy and quiet. Plus, he has had no experience beforehand. To make up for this, I made sure to have his shifts correlate with mine, so that I can train him and all that. The boss did train him as well, but didn't really go in depth with him like he did with me which I found to be a red flag at the start. It seemed unfair.

Few days pass and my brother is doing pretty well considering his personality and his first time ever working. However, there is one issue and it's that my brother can't multitask. For instance, this job also requires cleaning stuff like sweeping hair off the ground, wiping the windows, or dusting the supplies. However, while doing all that, you'd still need to be aware of the customers and make sure that everything is going smoothly. That's where my brother lacks understanding. He does things in a 1,2,3 fashion and doesn't understand how to do all that especially because it's quite stressful on someone inexperienced. 

Therefore, I asked the co-workers to help him through all that, and ease his stress. Since that started to work, I requested my boss to have seperate our time shifts because he seemed ready.

My boss has cameras that have audio and he can view them via his phone. He doesn't watch them when I'm working, but does when my brother is working and starts to poke at every little thing. He also frequently visits the store when my brother is there but never when I'm there.

Everyday after work my brother comes distressed and upset, and everyday my mom gets complaint calls about his work. Me and my mom are quite pissed at my boss's claims, especially when we hear my brother's side of the story (and my brother doesn't lie).

First, he claims that my brother is horrible at cleaning. Mind you, my brother is a clean freak and theres NO WAY that's true. I'm a worse cleaner. I even tested it out once. Once my boss was in the shop, and he was just sitting on his laptop doing his work in his office. I knew the windows were dirty, they had finger smudges everywhere. But I left them there. And he didn't do anything to me. Yet, today after my brother's shifts I hear him tell me that the boss made him clean it 3 times because it ""had a smudge."" What the fuck.

Secondly, he claims my brother doesn't do his job. Sometimes, the barbers check the computer at the front to see the waiting list of the clients, any potential appointments, and how much clients they've had so far.  And I let them, but I watch them ofc. Rarely, there will be times where they do the transactions themselves, but it would be if I'm in the washroom. And my boss has seen me do this. Yet, when my brother does this, my boss yells at my mom claiming that his co-workers arent trustworthy and my brother is too easy to manipulate by letting them tamper with the laptop. This also happened with the phone, where once I was dealing with a customer and the phone rang, but my co-worker answered it (which turned out to be the boss) then gave me it when I was finished. I wasn't in any trouble. But the same exact thing happened to my brother, and he got yelled at on the phone.

Thirdly, he claims that my brother sits idly all the time. While I do know what he's talking about, I have consoled my brother about this and told him to always be aware of your surroundings. Usually my brother just stands around when hes done his duties, but he's supposed to look out for anything else he needs to do. When he's sure that there's nothing, he's free to stand behind the register and relax. I do it all the time. But my brother is not even ALLOWED to relax at this point, because my boss keeps calling him lazy and other stuff even when he's literally done everything. 

And the best of all, my boss constantly compares me to my brother. He always tells him to ""be like your sister"" and criticised him otherwise. This pisses me off a lot, especially because we have DIFFERENT amount of experience. I think its absolutely stupid that my boss, instead of HELPING him, CRITICISES him for not being like me! We're not even the same people!

I genuinely see this as absolutely unfair. I don't even want to work for such a man anymore, but this job has been very great. I don't even know what to do at this point. My boss keeps threatening to fire my brother, and I've claimed that if my brother leaves I could leave as well. I understand firing my brother if it was because he thought he was not suitable for the job, but the reasons my boss has given is an unfair reason for firing anybody. 

Please, I don't know what to do at all.

Edit: Typos",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bamekw/my_boss_is_going_too_far/,3," It is entirely possible that your brother's personality isn't as good a fit for the job as yours is. That's okay. We are all good at different things. Try to step back and look at the situation with a bit of distance instead of as a sister.  If you can see the points the boss is making and your brother can't or won't adjust to the work requirements, he should look for different work.
At the end of the day, the boss sets the job requirements. It sounds like you are meeting them and he isn't.  That's not a knock against him. He just needs to find work that is a better fit for his skills and interests. But, there is no reason to throw away a perfectly good job to ""defend"" your brother. You wouldn't interfere if it was a different employer. Let him figure it out for himself.  If he gets fired, that will be a learning experience for him.  ",2019-04-07 23:07:34

I suffer with anxiety and depression and my job does not make the situation better. Not so much the job but more the people. There was an incident on the phone where others complained about the way i had said something to a customer. This was not true. We finished the call and the customer did not call back at all.  I was taken into a room by a manager and spoken to about this. Not my manager a different manager, at that point in time, there were NO managers on the floor. He had asked me what was said so i explained what i said to the customer. He had advised that others in the office had complained about me and that i was aggressive and rude ( i certainly wasnt). Baring in mind, we work in an open office and there was no one around me during this call. He asked if i was okay, apparently he was making sure i was okay. No im sorry.I walked out of the meeting as i felt as though he was only asking me to cover his ass and people were gossiping as per usual.

&#x200B;

After this incident i was sick with anxiety, i was fuming and was winding myself up. Another who sits behind me (she was not there during the call) was asking me about what happened. This is not the first time something like this has happened and my frustration built and built and i started crying and I said I needed to leave. I said 'Everyone is a bunch of backstabbing cunts'. Then left the office.

I can 100% take responsibility of this. I was angry, frustrated and unsupported. It was absolutely stupid and I told my manager that i needed to leave. When i got home I had a panic attack and was shaking with emotion. The next day I couldn't bring myself to go to work to i went to the doctor for advise and he signed me off with anxiety and depression for 2 weeks.

Yesterday was my first day back. My back to work meeting was left till the last hour all day so I was concerned all day. Apparently my last absence, which was also anxiety and depression (not doctors note as i was in the 5 day self certified absence) was my final written warning  which means that they will take this instance to pannel. I have no occupational health review right now but i was planning on calling them today.

AS WELL AS THIS. more than one person complained that i personally called them cunts in the office. So i 100% should not have said something like that out loud but due to my frustrated and upset state it just came out. In no way was it personal to anyone and the manager around me will say it wasn't personal. But more than one person complained. So this is also going to a misconduct meeting. I have no notes on my record about this but im a blunt person, i dont beat around the bush. Im not passive aggressive like people in the office i just say it how it is and people do not like it.

I am absolutely sick to my body about this whole situation, yesterday i couldn't stop crying like what the absolute hell is wrong with people. My manager has given me the option to resign immediately without having to go through all of this. I was going to hand my 4 week notice in next week as im moving to another side of the country. But i need the money. Obviously there is no way anyone could tell me what to do, but i dont think mentally i could handle all these meetings, and having to go to work everyday around these insects unless i thought i had a great chance. I have a couple of people in work who will 100% support me if i do.

I am going to call an employee helpline this morning and occupational health, but apart from that i need to decide if i should resign or not. Everyone I have spoke to have advised me to fight it.

I found a call center job  but:

1. The trainer in my call center is treating us like slaves, wanting us to do homework after our shift ends and then requesting presentations for the next day, leaving us no time to rest.

2. Management is constantly threatening us to fire us if we mess it up, I don’t even want to make a mistake because I don’t know the consequences.

3. I don’t socialize with my coworkers, I find them very vulgar and the type of person who likes gossip and I’m just not like that, I’m also not used to people who doesn’t respect diversity and I find myself alone, I don’t talk to people here apart from the hi and bye.

4. I need the paycheck for my things and so I don’t have to rely on my parents anymore. I want to be free but with my parents help that’s almost impossible. I felt miserable without a job and now that I have it...I feel I’m in a very negative environment. 

What can I do to last long and gain experience? I want my parents to know I’m determined to be independent and also be disciplined and be a good worker.

I dont come from your walk of life, its always been work or live on the streets.

Quick jab aside. Sounds like your enviroment is a shit hole. Generally call center work pays well enough for low level work but they treat you like crap because you are incredibly replaceable. The job is not difficult. You query a database they give you to answer customers, fidget with customers account, act like you have all the answers, and place people on hold. Many of the items you will discuss with customers have scripts. Those jobs are easy and pay enough that the company can fire some one for minor issues and have them replaced in a short amount of time.

You have been studying. What have you been studying? Why not look for low level work in the field you actively study so you can leverage that experience with the end results of your studies to propel you into a career position?

349,bc7t5x,False,Discipline,5,I’m a recruiter for internships at my organization. Just hired a graduate assistant and NOW learn from someone else that she’s a horrible employee,jobs,"So to put this in context. I’m 23 years old, a recent college graduate, and I work at a research organization within a university. I’m a very recent hire and my job is to recruit student workers, volunteers, interns, grad assistants, etc. And basically be their “boss” aka I have the power to hire, pay, and fire them. Which is a HUGE responsibility! 

To get to the problem, I hired a grad assistant and I just had orientation with her this morning. One of my coworkers recognizes her, pulls me aside IMMEDIATELY and tells me “that girl does NOT do her work, she doesn’t get along with anyone, she has an attitude, and she’s overall a bad employee”. This is from a past experience working with her, I guessed.

I just submitted all her hiring paperwork to HR, and she’s here to stay for at least the next year, is what I told her. I’m supposed to talk to her actual boss tomorrow and warn her about this girl. Also, this girl is 30 and I’m scared she’s not going to take me seriously if i try to talk to her about her performance. This is one of the reasons I don’t like being in charge of people my own age, or older.

I don’t know, I’m trying to prepare for every scenario possible in my head and I’m freaking out. It’s not like I can fire her but I feel like I really screwed up and I should have seen this coming when we interviewed her in the first place. She SEEMED like a great candidate, she clearly had the experience necessary for the job, but the way she talked was very off-putting and it really didn’t seem like she would fit, but we had to hire someone and she was the only “good” candidate.

Basically I don’t know how to discipline people if they are not complying with our policies or not completing work assignments. I really don’t want to have an awkward conversation with her, and I especially don’t want her to get angry. UGH! I’m beyond stressed about this as you can tell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bc7t5x/im_a_recruiter_for_internships_at_my_organization/,0,"She works there now, and she should be judge on the work that she performs at new job.

350,c2do7x,False,Discipline,1,Should I tough it out or jump ship?,jobs,"I started this job the last couple days of April. It's my first full time office job, before this I've only worked part time as a tutor, retail, and prep cook. I was excited about it at first but now I dread going into work and I'm honestly only posting now cause I can't sleep because of anxiety. 

It's data entry for a pharmaceutical company. They used to have my department in another state, but decided to move everything to this state in like a couple months and replace all the experienced people there with new people here. So we're expected to be able to do the quantity and quality of work after like 2 months of experience of people who had been there for years.

And it's only 12 dollars an hour. 

I'm constantly told what I'm doing wrong,and absolutely no positive feedback to balance it out. They want a certain amount of work done which I'm struggling to meet so I rush things and make mistakes. 

Yesterday my boss called me in for a meeting with another supervisor from the other state on speaker. They told me they're lowering my daily goal of work for the next 2 weeks but they need my accuracy to go up. And it's weird cause they'll say focus on quality but then follow it up with that they do need my quantity up. They said it was a coaching session bit it just felt like reprimand. At one point my eyes started to water and my boss told me not to be upset in her sickly sweet voice I've come to hate. They said they want the job to be fun?

My boss wants me to be more independent and stop asking so many questions but also reassured me she's always happy to help. But so many times now her answers have been condescending or just something like ""What do you think?"" I don't know, that's why I'm asking! 

 I asked a question about something that had confused me last week that she had explained. It's a big important client so I wanted to make sure I got it right. When I asked she only responded with ""I explained this last week, did you forget?"" 

So because of stuff like that I feel damned if I do and damned if I don't. If I ask a question, I just am made to feel dumb and useless. If I don't and try to figure it out myself, I get it wrong and mess things up. 

I started with two other people who have now been moved to different things, still in the same department, but their jobs are way easier, even they've admitted it. So they look great and I in comparison look like a bad employee. 

There's new people who were trained a few weeks after me. They learned things I didn't. The only reason I ever know things change or information got updated is because I heard it from them. They also tend to avoid difficult work to do the easier work to get their daily goal up so I do the hard stuff and then get it wrong. And at first I was understanding because I did the same thing when I started but now it's just...a lot.

It's like I can't make mistakes at all and it feels like my boss takes it as a personal insult when I do. 

There's a lot to do and I honestly think we're severely understaffed. My boss takes her whirl home and works off the clock. So she's clearly burnt out. There's overtime offered every week and at this point it feels like an expectation to do it. We never get a thank you for doing it. We never get a thank for anything. Like I said, no positive feedback. 

Is this typical for full time jobs? Do I need to just suck it up?

TLDR: company decided to move entire department in two months and is unhappy people, including me, aren't doing the same quality and quantity as people who were there for years. All I hear is negative feedback, nothing positive. Training was rushed and now there's new info the new people know that I didn't. Questions are met with condescension.

353,a5gnzx,False,Discipline,14,"Called in Sick, Told to come in Anyway",jobs,"Hello, not sure if this is the right place to do this. I've been working at my job for 2 years now, and in the beginning I got sick a lot and would call in whenever I was. I still was a very hard worker, and many of my managers praised my hard work, and even some of the higher ups complimented my work as well. I also would come in on days off or work for hours after my scheduled shift.

So recently, just got a new manager. She worked at the store before, but was never in charge of me. Initially, we didnt like each other, but once she saw how hardworking I was, she began to like me, and same with me, for requested days off were usually approved. I've been working with her for 3 months, and during these three months I haven't called in sick once. I've also worked give overtime hours, and she has written me several times thanking me for how hard I've been working (I work at Safeway so I stock things basically and face)

One of my other managers who oversees the schedule and such, doesnt like me (which most people in the store do like me and even were shocked at some of the things hes done) There was a time he yelled at me during my first year when I needed time off after finding out my Grandma had stage 4 cancer. The past 4 days Ive been feeling very sick. I didnt want to call in because I really wanted the money for Christmas presents for my boyfriend and family, so I worked those days, not taking a lunch either on any of those days to make sure the job was finished. Today though, I felt dizzy and couldn't even get out of bed for a few hours. I've been having a very bad headache, sore throat, runny nose and cough with a heavy feeling in my chest. I'm not sure if its bronchitis or another sinus infection, just a really bad one, but I just knew if I went to work today i could potentially pass out. So, I let my manager know, she didnt say anything. Then I called the store to let them know. My schedule manager answered and instantly was annoyed and I felt terrified because I knew he might yell at me again. I told him I felt awful and was wondering I could use my sick hours for today (whenever I called out previously I never used sick hours, but this time I really didnt want to take a hit to my paycheck) he began saying ""this is the worst possible day to do this, she has to count EVERYTHING.  You can't call in you have to come in. You've been calling in a lot again."" I tried to fight back tears because I was not expecting him to tell me I couldn't, is that even possible? And I wanted to say I hadn't been calling in, in fact it had been over 3 months of solid working even overtime. But I just said okay. Hung up the phone and cried. My boyfriend told me I needed to be more firm, stand up for myself and learn to say no, but then offered to call.  I told him no, that would make things worse.

My mom also was upset, and told me he can't do that. I told her I already agreed to come in. Now I'm concerned not only will I potentially pass out from being dizzy, but also that I could get others sick.

I'm also now on the bad side of my schedule manager (let's just call him J) again, who yelled at me on the phone. I've even come to work before with a face mask on when I was very sick, just so I didnt get yelled at by him for calling in. I have a very weak immune system, have had doctors notes almost 90 percent of the time I've been sick, and they even see me coughing and having to blow my nose. 

What should I do? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a5gnzx/called_in_sick_told_to_come_in_anyway/,3,"> What should I do? 

You should get another job. Any manager that thinks they have the right to yell, scream at, or berate a worker for not coming in when they're obviously sick is not worth sticking under. They care more about you doing inventory than they care about the fact that you're spreading your potentially contagious disease(s) to unsuspecting customers? They'll have fewer customers next week if half of the people who touched the items you stocked get sick. Also, learn to hold your ground and not be a doormat. If you can't come in, then you can't come in. Point blank. That goes for working on days you're sick, days you're scheduled to be off but they call you anyway, etc. They can ask you to come in or to cover someone, but you don't have to oblige. I understand that it's holiday season and you want to earn the money to buy gifts for your loved ones, but I'm sure they'll appreciate that you're healthy and happy more than they'll appreciate a material item that you put yourself in the hospital for. Take care of yourself. ",2018-12-12 09:30:14

355,b23rke,False,Discipline,3,"Had a rough start at work, struggling and dont know what to do",jobs,"&#x200B;

So here it goes,

So it's been 4 months on my first job and I've been struggling at my current work. I work in an IT company and being deployed on the client's location. I work as a business analyst, honestly I was usually a dev throughout my years in college but felt like exhausted being a dev since i also felt like I'm just mediocre to moderate as a developer, so I decided to try out becoming an analyst, just to know what it feels like and I was always curious on how it feels like becoming a business analyst even if it was outside my comfort zone. I just don't want to feel that regret of not trying out other jobs that I've been always curious of. Cause who knows, it might be the right one for me right? Anyways, before I applied to the company, I've already asked a few people who worked there, and they told me they had a good start and it was also a good start for fresh grads, good pay, proper training and the projects they had were worth the experience. So that's how I made my decision of applying there as my first job.

So when the day  came on my first day of the job, I was informed that I'll be only working with a team lead. No other teammates, the project manager's role is only to manage financials(Idk thats what they told me, but yeah cant approach them), so just a team lead. There weren't even any trainings as well. The team lead is only instructed to attend once a week for the whole day or 1 hour per day, only to give feedbacks on my outputs and to report to him whatever I did throughout the day. So, it wasnt how I expected it would be but I said to myself that it felt like it was manageable, it was a bit difficult, but yeah, still manageable. 2 months later, my team lead told me that he was going to resign and after he left everything went downhill. At first, the client told me that they were going to look for a replacement to the team lead, but in the end they said to me that they will be getting a senior BA but would be working on a different project and I will be directly reporting to the client instead.  I felt like I was just told what I should do but I'm not really feeling like I'm being trained like a BA. There was also that pressure of ""Aren't you a BA? Then you should know these things or what to do right?"". Ever since that happened, I felt like my drive of looking forward to work slowly faded away. They also keep pressuring me in a ""joking-tone-but-im-serious"" manner regarding the deadlines  of each output even though it's not my fault. The cause of delays were because of numerous meetings with several departments for feedbacks and opinions regarding the output, and they don't immediately respond if they are  going to attend the meeting so we had to keep rescheduling until they do. And currently Im just almost finished with one output out of six, and the length of the whole project is 6 months(so 1 month per output), so basically there's only 2 months left and probably they'll extend it but I feel like I cant see myself doing this 5 more times since I realized I dont like what I'm doing and I lost my drive. I also feel like I don't want to go back there anymore as I feel like everytime I go there I just lose my morale and just getting depressed. So now I started to realize and ask myself these questions:

* Is this work really meant for me or it's ridiculous for them to just leave me there alone on my first project?
* Should I ask the IT manager or HR to request to go back to becoming a dev and just try to become better at it?
* Should I tell the IT manager or HR for what I'm experiencing now and request for a different project or  request for assistance?

Need advice or opinion on how you're going to handle this situation as I don't know what to do as of now.

&#x200B;

I also actually want to know if it's normal working alone on your first job and on your first project without any training or even a mentor, and also being deployed on the client's location, and if it is okay if I suddenly ask to transfer to a different project since I don't feel that comfortable working there anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b23rke/had_a_rough_start_at_work_struggling_and_dont/,2,What exactly do you want?  ,2019-03-17 10:11:02
356,as4qis,False,Discipline,9,How fair is it to retroactively discipline an employee for attendance?,jobs,"There’s this extremely problematic employee who happens to be one of our most productive. Part of the reason they’re one of our most productive is that they’re often mean to other people and fail to develop the skills of those around them.

This employee disrespects me and others, and I’m about done being nice. It just so happens that they’re often late and/or absent. I’ve documented their attendance infractions, but I haven’t had any conversations with them or had them sign off on the forms—a step needed for each documented incident.

The bad news, however, is that our department head doesn’t apply the attendance policy on a consistent basis. 

The head boss keeps hinting to me that they want “us,” as a management team, to write people up, but I get the impression that they’re kinda scared to apply the policy.

To be honest, I kind of am, too.

Partly because I don’t want to do the boss’s “dirty work” by writing everyone up if the boss is going to feign cluelessness to the policy. Partly because I don’t want to write the problematic employee up retroactively when I (and other managers) have been late, as well. I don’t know if my manager would suddenly, retroactively write me up, too, since our (and the company’s) numbers have been kinda bad recently, and none of us managers’ jobs are really that safe. And partly because this employee exhibits some psychopathic behavior, such as frequent triangulation of people. So I don’t want them to organize something at my expense.

So...how risky is it for me to write this person up, retroactively? Would it be fair?

This person’s attitude and character are detrimental to the team, and their presence and behaviors detract from team morale. My boss says the employee has been warned that they’re on thin ice for not having a proper attitude, and I’ve tried to support them as best I can. I feel like I’m running out of ways to help them succeed, and in a sense they’re a constant detriment to the goals of the team.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/as4qis/how_fair_is_it_to_retroactively_discipline_an/,0,"It sounds like this employee has plenty you can write him up for.

It sounds like this employees main problem is that he is not working well with others so that’s what I’d focus on.

364,b02hpv,False,Discipline,5,How do you know if you’ve been put on a PIP?,jobs,"I got promoted to assistant manager of a failing sales team at the end of last fiscal quarter.

Our district manager was supposed to train me, but for whatever reason he didn’t. So instead our general manager did, with the rationale being that the GM used to be a DM. Kinda weird but whatever.

Sales still suck, and the quarter is almost over.

So today my district manager came in and told me our sales are bad, and he gave me a chart to track my sales. He says he wants me to improve my sales by basically 10% in the next six weeks. He asked me what I think is keeping the team from higher sales, and we brainstormed some things to help raise sales.

He didn’t say what would happen if I don’t.

I’m kinda taken aback and unsure of how to interpret all of this. I barely even got promoted.

A lot of the powerful people in the company seem to like me (VPs, DMs, etc.)...except for the territory manager, who is just above district manager but below VP. The territory manager is friendly with me, but when I observe closely, I can tell something is off in how he reacts to my presence.

Our hierarchy is like: Founders>VPs>Territory Manager>District Managers>General Managers>Assistant Managers>Shift Managers",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b02hpv/how_do_you_know_if_youve_been_put_on_a_pip/,1,"hey mate, I read your other post, so I'll reply here.

I don't know what you sell, but I can give you some tips for selling anything. 

Basically the first thing you want to do is identify what level of investment your customer/client is making in purchasing goods and/or services from you.

Basically, there are a zillion combinations of product/service, but you can boil almost anything down to a fundamental relationship that is this: all sales fall somewhere along the line connecting two extremes, the extremes are:

1. Low price point, service means nothing since the item is likely consumable and you'll never have to see the retailers ugly mug again

2. Extremely high pricepoint, where you're purchasing a high end product that is irrevocably paired with strenuous, rigorous service - and, by buying this product or service you are tied into a relationship with the seller. (Examples might be hiring a specialized consultant to build a model of a highly complex system, or hiring a lawyer, or purchasing a fleet of Boeing 747's) - in all these cases, you're going to be locked into a relationship for some period of time, sometimes your whole life.

The point here, is that as the seller you need to be cognoscente of the investment the consumer must make in the purchase of your product. If you are selling paper - are you *just* selling paper, or are you selling the service agreement in which you will provide them with paper for a period of time?

If you are selling something relatively inexpensive, your focus should not be on YOU, the focus should be on the product, and economy. If you are selling something more expensive, then you must start to sell yourself as a reliable provider, as well as the product.

In a project management course I took recently, there is a ""goal"" of becoming a ""trusted advisor"". This means that you speak to your client with truth - not sales; but truth. Meaning, that you aren't acting solely to benefit your pocket, or your company's revenue, but you are speaking to them with their best interests at heart. And by doing this, you gain significant good will. Sometimes this comes cheaply, and sometimes it comes at significant expense.

Here are two examples: A client approaches me and asks me to compare and contrast the model we built and the model they had from a couple years ago. I realise immediately that their previous model was built in a very robust way, and contains several tertiary level calculations that I know my junior engineers could not possibly  do. I tell my client that the previous work is at a standard that surpasses the work I have just provided him. He agrees, but then instead of getting mad, he asks what I can do to remediate the situation. I say we can use the client's previous model as a basis for improvement and we adopt some specific modules to the higher standard. We cover the work under training, since I know my junior engineers will learn something valuable. The client is extremely happy and as a result we are awarded with more work.

Example 2: I submit a proposal for some work and the client is considering two different software types to accomplish the job. We are specialised in only one of them. We realise quickly that the training time on the othr software would make our bid uncompetitive. I tell the client that we are not in a position to make a bid on the work because of this issue. They appreciate our position and award the project to someone else. Here, we've been honest up front and the client appreciated our forthcoming attitude and honesty. We lost $150k worth of work, but we gained credibility.

In either case, it's the cost of doing business, but by gaining good will and credibility we're putting ourselves continually in a better position.

The TL;DR here, is that you can find ways to be honest with the client, be honest about everything and it'll pay off. a 10% increase in sales will not be difficult with a bit of time spent getting to know your clients, or knowing what to focus on.

Ohya, and I wouldn't be worried about getting the axe. Don't stress that - that's just paying interest on a debt you haven't incurred. ",2019-03-12 02:43:37

So I am returning to my summer job in a few days, at which my anxiety is returning at full force. Little context: I work at an architecture firm where I'd like to think I am a valued employee (have received compliments about my progress, been given raises, etc). But it is a huge field with lots of drawings/contractors/knowledge that are prone to mistakes.

Basically my fear comes from making mistakes and being disciplined - basically the idea of being given responsibility and letting others down or being punished and being at fault. It's to the point where all day I am constantly shaking in fear of messing up or worrying about the next new task I'll be given and whether or not I will be able to figure it out or mess up royally. I just know if something happened I'd feel so very ashamed and upset at myself. Now my bosses are not bad people and they are not the cause of my anxiety I believe, as it is more internal attributions that cause these feelings. They have never directly given me cause to think that any mess up by me would result in a yelling session or an immediate firing.

Do you have any ideas on how to change my way of thinking that this is simply something I do for money rather than a 9 hour fight-or-flight panic attack for survival? It almost is part of my identity and that if something bad happened that I could never recover or it would be life-changing. My ego is so afraid of looking dumb or letting down others that I am a perfectionist and cannot accept any less, otherwise the worst might happen. I'm always looking busy because I'm afraid of getting a new task which I have a new opportunity to fail.

I'd also suggest seeking professional help through counseling to help overcome these issues. This stuff is easier to fix now than later in life when it gets worse. Believe me, you aren't the only one going through it, particularly when you work so hard to get things done. One of the biggest problems I see brewing in the future of work for those of us under 35 is burnout and fatigue. If you've been formally educated and put your finances on the line to get a good career, then you're going to feel stress that it may go wrong at any moment. And it can and will go wrong. There may be a day you walk in and it's your last day. Trust me when I tell you that day may actually be a blessing and you can find something else that will satisfy you more than your current work.

369,a540im,False,Discipline,4,"(US) New manager made multiple inappropriate comments regarding my health, and misc. other things. How should I proceed? [xpost from askHR]",jobs,"So this is going to be a long post, but I want to make sure I explain the entire situation in hopes that I can get some opinions on what my next steps should be.

I'm in the US btw.

I'll start off with explaining that I was hired 3 years for position A. Hiring manager, and my reporting manager were incredible! One of the best things about this job was that they offered complete flexibility on working from home as needed, and there was no hard start-time. 

I was blessed with some great genes.

One being asthma since birth... which sometimes leads to pneumonia during the colder months. And the other is my kidney disease... which brings kidney stones, and causes me to be frequented with gout flare-ups. Whenever I have a gout flare-up, it'll last anywhere from 2 days, to 3-4 weeks. During which, I have a really tough time walking, sometimes not even being able to put a shoe on. So the job I took had to be completely flexible with working from home as necessary.

It also offered me the flexibility to help my in-laws (who are retired and disabled), and be home with my elderly dog when necessary. It was one of the main reasons I took the job. And I fell in love with this job. More and more every day. Was thriving in my role, and was working with some very awesome co-workers. First year review was great - 4/5 (and he noted he never gives out 5s. there's always room to improve, but couldn't really think of anything in particular with me. Raise #1 was alright. Didn't expect much, as it was my first year with the company.

Shortly after the first year, my then-manager mentioned that there was another team in need of someone with my skill-set and he thought it'd be a great fit as they were really in need of the help. He moved me to the new team, and I was situated with a new manager. Manager 2 was extremely supportive in furthering my career goals, and we clicked really well. Meetings with him were a blast, we'd geek out about technology for an hour+. Working with the new team during my 2nd year was great. I was learning more skills, and my opinion was being asked by department heads, on various important decisions. 

My 2nd year review was again, great. 4.5/5. Said that I should spend time writing more tests, and possibly get into automation if I ever wanted to chase a 5. The others on my team all have a different job title than me. They all went towards being full-stack developers, whereas I went more of the front-end UX/UI focus route. It's where my passion is, and is something I'm able to contribute to fully. Raise #2 was better than the first... and was on par with the work I was completing. No complaints about anything I did. Whenever I, or anybody on the team needed to work from home, it was perfectly okay. He knew we were all working, and that ""we're all adults here."" Treated us all like grownups, and showed us that respect. Something neat that this manager did, was introduce a 'completely optional learning objective', where we could choose to learn something new... to encourage us to keep learning. You could take time during the work-day to do this, too. If you chose to do it, it'd be noted on your annual review, and was something you could choose to demonstrate to the department heads. I was actually excited to do this. Did a learning objective to further my knowledge in a front-end programming language. Built a dummy site. It was small, but I learned a ton. But the important thing to remember here was that he helped get me excited about it.

Fast forward a half a year, and manager 2 got a job with a different company. Our team was given a new (much less experienced) manager... Manager 3. This is where things started going downhill. I'm sorry if I ramble on with any of this. I've never been so angry and sad about something like this.

So from the very beginning, there wasn't that great vibe, or connection I had with my previous managers. Manager 3 was constantly over-involving themselves in every meeting, and all of our planning (which isn't something any of the previous managers did.) The micro-management was obvious. Constantly asking how to get us to produce more work, ignoring the fact that we've been over-delivering for the past 2 years. Completely disregarding the work that we complete, and just constantly looking for more, more, more. Culture/Personality mismatch... 100%.

Manager 3 they started over-doing the individual meetings with us. Remember that 'completely optional learning objective' that manager 2 started? Manager 3 started pushing this as something that we should do... while continuing to call it 'optional'. Totally turned me off to wanting to do it... because not only was Manager 3 pushing this previously optional thing as a soft-requirement, they would tell you what they think you should do for it. Manager 3 wanted me to learn server-side coding, so I could become a full-stack developer, so I could ""contribute to more work"" - as if my days weren't already slammed packed with other work. So I say that I'm not interested in the optional learning objective, and that most of my days are already packed with work. Manager 3 also started speaking up during the personal meetings about wanting people to not working from home as much. I explained that some days I need to work from home for 'medical reasons', and it was something that I, and the company agreed to when I took this job.

During her first 6 months, I'm involved on multiple things, from UI wire-framing, to finishing stories for features, to resolving defects. Lead the entire design, and wire-frame process for multiple key features on a product we frequent. This was something I thought would be notable for a great review. Wouldn't you guess... Manager 3 gave me a god damn 3/5, and under critical notes explained that I didn't opt into doing the optional learning objective. I also got a smaller raise than I had in previous years. 

All and all, this review was a complete slap in the face to all of the hard work I put in, and money I both made for the company, and saved the company by reducing the amount of resources necessary in the design/mockup process. It didn't discourage me to the point of not working... I was really just disappointing that it was completely ignored. 

The next ~3 months, continued doing similar work, and manager 3 was constantly making comments about the team not working from home as much. Mind you, this isn't a company policy that they were trying to enforce. And sometimes, people are actually unable to make it into work due to health reasons. We're human.

Another month passes, and this is where things get very... inappropriate. This was around the time where we began working on strictly server-side code for a project. Something that I explained that I'm not at all experienced in. I explained that I'd work alongside other developers, and hopefully learn as we go by observing. It wasn't realistic that I'd learn an entire programming language all while also owning and completing stories. I didn't say this, but it's worth mentioning that none of said language, or skill set was described in my job description... and that work was way above my pay-grade.

So I end up catching pneumonia... which completely knocked me off my feet with Thanksgiving just a week away. Had to go to the ER as I couldn't breathe. Asthma going crazy. It was awful. At that point, I had been out sick for 5 days... when I all of a sudden get an email to come in for a personal meeting the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I'm still sick at this point, so I angrily get dressed, and go in for said meeting.

Manager goes and asks how I'm doing, and follows that up with a discussion about how ""I know you've been sick, but I really need you to be contributing more for this feature..."" I'm dumbfounded at this point. The nerve to even say something like this... I explained that I'm still very much sick, have ER/doctors notes if necessary. But working while having pneumonia is just about the craziest thing I've ever heard. I explained that it sometimes takes people weeks to fully get over it. 

I don't think it's at all appropriate for a manager to make any comment about any illness, infection, or disease. If there was any policies, or company rules broken, then that needs to be addressed. But I hadn't broken any. I had sick time, and was using it as needed. I left after the meeting, still sick. Luckily had the two-day Thanksgiving break, and weekend to fight it off.

Got the news late Wednesday night that my grandfather passed away. that was miserable. Funeral/wake on Friday.

We still had Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday as planned. Never having eaten turkey on Thanksgiving as an adult, for whatever reason, I did this year. And boy, do I regret that decision entirely. Turns out, turkey is loaded with purines and is incredibly bad for people who suffer from gout. 

OH JOY! The next morning, my entire foot was swollen... and I couldn't put any pressure on it. At all. I've never had gout flareup the entire foot before, normally just effects my toe. I stubbornly tried ignoring it at first, limped down the street walking the dogs. I knew as soon as I got back in that I was very much doomed for the foreseeable future, with easily one of the worst gout flareups I've ever experienced. Here I am, pneumonia-gout ridden. I'm a total mess at this point. Couldn't put my shoe on, couldn't walk, couldn't do much at all. 

Luckily by late Saturday/early Sunday, the antibiotics finally killed my pneumonia. Unfortunately for me, my arch nemesis gout, remained with me. Sunday night the pain got so bad, I had to go to the ER. I was there until 6am on Monday... and a round of anti-inflammatory pills. After spending the entire previous night at the ER, I had to take another sick day on Monday. But emailed in that I'd be working from home on Tuesday ('for medical reasons'). Still suffering from the flareup, I worked from home the rest of the week. I made sure to participate in every meeting, and make my presence known. I wanted to make sure it was apparent I was working.

So that takes us to today. I finally made it back into the office! Had a semi-swollen toe, but it wasn't nearly as painful. Manager schedules another personal meeting with me, right after our morning team meetings. We get into the meeting and immediately felt the negative mood shift. Manager asks 'if I'm doing any better' (different tone than them previously asking how I was doing.) Then again, immediately going into their concerns over the past few weeks, and how I haven't shown any improvement.

I bluntly just looked at her, and explained that I've had pneumonia, gout and a death in the family all in the last month. Explained again that if necessary, I'd have doctors notes, to which they replied ""not necessary."" I explained that when I have a gout flareup, I'm unable to walk. Which means, I'm unable to safely drive. I'm able to sit in a chair at home and work from home without problem though. Manager replied ""I didn't know that's why you were working from home last week, you should have told me... but you still need to make an effort to make it into the office more."" I replied, that ""as long as I'm able to successfully work, it's wildly inappropriate to even suggest that I email my specific medical status."" I then asked if I should go speak to HR regarding my kidney disease, and work with them in allowing me to work from home as I need to... manager replied that ""we could both go and talk with them together.""

I've just about had it at this point. I have a kidney disease that I know one day will eventually kill me. And this manager is basically saying that coming into the office is more important than my comfort.

So I guess my question is:

Do I speak with HR regarding this? Or do I go directly above the manager's head to their manager? How would I approach HR, without this setting off landmines and losing my job over escalating this. What protections do I have legally (if any)?

Sorry for the long post... any advice would be greatly appreciated.



**TL/DR**:
Worked for current company for a little over 3 years. Took job because of the 'flexible work environment' which allowed me to work from home as needed. I have kidney disease, and pretty bad asthma. The kidney disease causes me to get gout frequently, and the asthma is just something I have to cope with during the cold months. When I have a bad gout flareup, I can't walk at all. First two managers let me work from as needed, treated me as an adult. New manager is fussing over me not getting as much done due to me being out sick.

Actual quotes: 

> ""I know you've been sick, but I really need you to be contributing more for this feature...""

...

> ""I didn't know that's why you were working from home last week, you should have told me... but you still need to make an effort to make it into the office more.""

Advice on approaching this conversation and actually getting results?,jobs,"I'll start this off saying that I've missed 4 days of work in the past month. Two of those were because I urgently needed to complete homework for college midterms, 2 were for mental health. During that week I was also scheduled about 47 hours even though I'm a part time employee (usually about 20-25 hours) and have never agreed to that many hours. I asked my manager if I could drop or swap my shifts and he laughed at me and said no. I've been struggling a bit and honestly I was at my breaking point, I don't normally miss work often at all (I've worked at my store for over a year) and I don't take it lightly. 

I also have recently been switched to a state insurance plan which is not free as it was last year, but requires co-pays for each appointment and prescription. Primary care appointments aren't too expensive but ER visits and psychiatrist visits have been costing me about $100. So I haven't brought a note from my psychiatrist to excuse my absences, and frankly I feel extremely uncomfortable even discussing mental health issues with my boss, but I'll get to that shortly.

A lot of employees have had issues with this GM for a long time and several reports to upper management have been made, usually resulting in a slap on the wrist. He almost never completes the weekly schedule on the day he promises to, he makes his assistant managers do almost all of his work for him (including signing important documents, for which they have a stamp with his signature on it), and he is notoriously rude and immature. He talks about how great at his job he is and how he knows how to make employees act how he wants them to, but truthfully almost no one respects him because he's so blatantly lazy and unprofessional.

Over the last couple of months my store has had two imperfect mystery shopper reports and my boss has been furious and constantly borderline yelling at employees, especially supervisors. He's been tightening policies, removing job perks (free items we previously were allowed, which is not a big deal but is obviously more punishment oriented than disciplinary), and threatening to fire people left and right. Every supervisor is scared of being demoted. One girl was just named employee of the month and she was also threatened with demotion for making a mistake this weekend.

All of our employees have been extremely on edge and unhappy, and I've heard most of our best employees mention looking for other jobs. Yesterday I walked by the managers office and overheard him yelling at our head supervisor, cussing and telling him that he better get people in line because ""these little shits are starting to piss me off"".

I'm a supervisor myself and I've worked hard this past year to get where I am and be great at my job. It's a lower wage hourly job so it's not the American dream or anything, but for a long time it was a great place for me to be while I'm in college.

Because of these unexcused absences, I've received 2 write ups, which resulted in me getting suspended for a week. I missed my shift today. I spoke to an assistant manager about it and was then called back by my general manager. He immediately began yelling at me and told me I must not care about my job and that I needed to prove to him that I do care, and then hung up on me while I was trying to explain to him why I missed my shift.

Let me emphasize that I truly do understand the importance of coming to work and being reliable, and I've always taken pride in my ability to do that. Literally just since early March have I begin slipping for the first time, and I've apologized and taken responsibility each time. I didn't complain when I was written up, and I didn't try to make excuses even given that my mental health has been in bad shape. But he is demanding an explanation and has sent an additional write up for me to our HR department. He told me to come in Monday if I want to make a statement to explain myself, but said that he can't really see how a piece of paper is going to help me.

My workplace has become so toxic and everyone is so unhappy, when he spoke to me so disrespectfully today I truly considered going in tomorrow and turning in my written two week notice. But I don't have other employment yet, and I honestly do care about my coworkers and the fact that they are clearly being used and abused by someone who has no idea how to actually run the place without throwing tantrums. I emailed my district manager and explained the general situation and asked that he call me tomorrow.

How can I approach this conversation in a way that's professional but doesn't gloss over how toxic my manager is? Truthfully, at this point I want this guy to get fired. He's a terrible manager and he's turning our store into a miserable place. I really want to see some kind of actual result come of this, and I'm honestly really nervous about going in on Monday because I know he's going to try to downplay any explanation I have and make me feel worse.

371,a0dhat,False,Discipline,5,How to deal with a Negative Coworker???,jobs,"I've been working at {place} for about a year now, my co-worker and I are ""friends"" but she's probably the most toxic person I've ever met. She complains about literally everything, calls in sick atleast once a week, tells me I do ""nothing"", makes unnecessary comments towards me like ""ew, never wear your hair like that again"", acts like she's the manager (and makes sure everybody knows it too) , makes everyone try to feel sympathetic towards her, and she talks shit about everyone behind everyones back. How do I deal with this on a day to day basis? She's the type of person if I confront her she is going to be passive aggressive and snobby... (other people have left the position because of her) :( I hate this, going to work everyday is toxic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a0dhat/how_to_deal_with_a_negative_coworker/,7,"Hi! I've been where you're at before and have successfully turned that kind of relationship around! Girls like that can kind of suck the life out of you sometimes :( One day I decided I had enough of my co-worker's snobby, narcissistic and controlling personality--and I wasn't going to let this woman-child walk all over me. So, brace yourself, but you have to talk this out with her. Chances are she's not the kind of person who's been called out before, so this is just as good for you as it is for her!

&#x200B;

Definitely don't start with an ""I think you're a toxic person"" opener because then she'll know that you've been hating on her for a really long time; I would assume she would act out (get passive aggressive or snobby) just because no one likes getting called out; it's a defense mechanism. Instead, pick an isolated incident--like if she ever puts you down by saying ""Ew, don't wear that"" then, I'd recommend in the next 10 minutes to an hour, that you ask to speak with her away from everyone else so you can tell her that you don't appreciate it when she says flippant comments like that. Maybe one of these lines would work for you: ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" or ""Let's go get a coffee"" or ""Let me put time on my calendar so we can chat. When are you free?"" Anything neutral like that to get her away if you work in a group so she doesn't feel like she's being called out unprofessionally. Once you have that down--ease into it and say something like: ""Hey, when you said/did *that*, it made me feel really shitty/disrespected and I want to make sure this stops"" or ""Maybe you didn't pick up on it, but when you do or say *that*, it's really unprofessional and I'd rather you kept it to yourself"" Sandwich it with something like ""I really like how you're such a hard worker and you show initiative in the office"" or ""I like your style and would love to hit you up for advice sometime"" --Something that is positive and that shows you respect, at least one part, of who she is.

&#x200B;

Remember--Why are you letting her determine how YOU feel? Once you stop putting her needs before yours, you'll see that it's necessary to advocate for yourself. Don't expect an immediate change, but do expect some push back. When I called out my co-worker, I wasn't prepared for her to go into a crying fit and explain to me that she has a lot of stress in her life/lots of father issues and that sometimes she's mean and just doesn't even realize it. Historically, I'm not the type of person to stick up for myself--I've always minimized my feelings in those situations and it honestly felt so good to A) understand why she is how she is and B) to rally for my fucking self. You can do this gently and in a way that is genuine to your attitude and lifestyle. Don't get worked up, don't shout, don't engage. Just state how you feel (show your vulnerability) and it's up to her how she reacts. 

&#x200B;

Another thing to think about is making sure you can dot your i's and cross your t's--she could call you out for ""doing nothing"" so really look at your work performance so she doesn't manipulate this back on you. If she brings that up again, you can say that's something you'll be happy to work on. If she is just actually that awful to work with, you should escalate it to your boss or your HR department **AFTER** you've attempted to fix the situation. They will be happy to cut off the poison on the team if it means keeping good workers.

373,b6mrg0,False,Discipline,2,Tips for work ethic improvement?,jobs,"Recently I have found myself struggling with my nosediving work ethic in the office.....since 2016. After getting a standard Good Ol' American 9-5 Office Gig, I've been lazy and unmotivated in my work day. It's a frustrating and embarrassing realization as new ""rules"" are put into place for myself and my colleague to follow due to my inability to pick up the slack. Tasks and assignments fall my the wayside as I cannot see the urgency or even the reason for doing them. Little stuff like....printing copies or sending out an email blast. I'm an admin, so I do basic little stuff.

I don't know how to describe it other than I am completely un-invested in the work that I do. My job previous to this, I did lots of physical work such as packaging, counting, moving, and all around handling products. I was involved in meetings and discussions but the overall physicality of movement and sensation of *doing something* kept my mind sharp and heart happy.  

I'm worried that if my work ethic continues to landslide I'll struggle to find and enjoy any job. I can't quit, because of bills and a somewhat high col area and any jobs I search for just seem to be different versions of office-related Hell. I struggle with what I want my career to be due to feeling so far behind in life as is (26, shit degree, lots of time wasted, no valuable skills, etc)

There's many things I want to do, apply for certifications and start a freelance writing gig but my job has totally destroyed my self esteem and mental happiness to the point where everything is a big ""why bother."" I can't seem to find motivation, inspiration, heck even *joy* in anything. 

What's the way to fix this? Books, meditation, working out and yoga? How do I take that first plunge and start myself on the long path toward a better work ethic and an overall happier life? Most of all how do I care about working again? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b6mrg0/tips_for_work_ethic_improvement/,2,"I have been there. The days are downright long and the fatigue settles in earlier and earlier every day. Here are my suggestions:

1) Talk to someone (a therapist, if your benefits allow for it or if you have some money) I was in the same rut and I felt like I couldn’t be happy. I started seeing a therapist about 8 months ago and it has given me a lot of perspective on my life. They help you connect the dots on what you need but you don’t realize it.

2) Meditate. I use an app called Calm and it’s guided meditation (because I hate silence) it’s $60/year but I know there are other rates you can do (monthly, one time payment, etc.). There is a meditation series for everything. There is one on mindfulness at work that helps with stress and work ethic. People have a hard time believing that slowing your day down increases productivity. TRUST ME, slowing down your day will help. What I mean by that is take time and do 15 minutes of meditation, slow down the racing thoughts and learn to look at things with a different perspective. In the words of Tom and Donna from Parks and Rec, Treat yo self.” Spend some time learning about yourself and your thoughts. Don’t be afraid to take a breather, the human body tells you when it needs it.

3) Find what you enjoy (easier said than done, right? WRONG) what do you truly enjoy in life? For me, it’s computers and video games. So what I did was I started studying for different certifications to understand computer related items and how video games are made.  Now, your thinking, “But I have no motivation to do it.” The biggest mistake you can make is giving yourself a “made-up” timeline. All this does is create an unrealistic expectation for yourself and frustrate you when you fall behind. Think of it this way, each day is an investment into your future. The fact that you thought about doing certifications tells me all I need to know about you. You are motivated, but maybe you don’t know where to start. One day at a time (as cliche as it sounds) but trust me, thinking so far out in the future will overwhelm you.

I am 25, have a Bachelor's in Mathematics, and am considering eventually starting a PhD program. However, I really  want to experience industry life first. Also, I want a job in Machine  Learning; however, I don't have any  credentials toward that career and need to self study / get a Master's. I've built the following saturated schedule:

&#x200B;

Every Week:

1. 30 minutes daily reading published academic papers in Machine Learning and Statistics
2. Seven 30 minute increments over Saturday and Sunday programming (implementing) the research I read
3. 8.5 hours daily minimum of work at my job (including lunch) Monday through Friday
4. 1.5 hours total commute to work Monday through Friday
5. 1 hour of morning prep for job + breakfast Monday through Friday
6. 1.5 hours daily of gym exercise and daily hygiene
7. 8.5 hours of sleep Sunday through Thursday
8. 7.5 hours of sleep Friday and Saturday
9. 0 to 2.5 hours daily of reading textbooks depending on work/breaks
10. 6.5 hours split over Saturday and Sunday for Laundry, Shopping and Cooking
11. Fourteen 30 minute increments over Saturday, Sunday and Work lunch to program personal projects
12. 0 to 1 hours daily of free time + Food Snack depending on work.

Total: 168 hours.

&#x200B;

Here are the personal projects I want to do:

1. Finish and Improve my undergraduate research project in Bioinformatics using Machine Learning / Stats
2. Create an AI Library that can be used to perfectly play the game Snake to maximum score
3. Complete a Kaggle project to high accuracy
4. Solve a few Data Science problems at my job to increase profits
5. Greatly reduce/minimize the training data set size needed for a ML algorithm of my interest
6. Work on a big real life problem

&#x200B;

Here are the subjects/books I want to study:

1. Matrix Computations (780 Pages)
2. Intro to Statistical Learning (440 Pages)
3. Applied Predictive Modeling (615 Pages)
4. Statistical Inference (686 Pages)
5. Generalized Linear Models (411 Pages)
6. Bayesian Data Analysis (656 Pages)
7. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Theory (323 Pages)
8. Elements of Statistical Learning (764 Pages) + Skim Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning

&#x200B;

Timeline:

1. Over 5 years: complete as many personal projects, textbooks (full comprehension), and research papers as possible. Get experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, R, Python w/ Scikit-learn, SQL and noSQL. Apply for a Master's degree in Machine Learning Fall 2023.
2. Over 1 year: study the Deep Learning Book and take a free online course (i.e., Andrew Ng's course using the Python/sklearn GitHub repo). Continue work on personal projects.
3. Over 2 years: Start my Master's degree at a great out of state university using my savings and learn everything I can on Measure Theory, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistics, Transfer Learning and a Specialization like Computer Vision. Work a part time job at night, spend 30 to 40 hours a week on studying/homework and spend 20 to 30 hours a week on research with a PI. Do an internship over the summer.
4. Over 1 year: Continue working a part time night job and experiment with freelance/consulting to pay loans. Take six graduate math courses non-degree (Complex  Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Information Theory, Measure Theoretic Probability Theory), and focus on more research with a new PI.
5. Consider Applying for PhD programs in growing, marketable, technologically focused fields with sparse available talent while seriously looking at my value to industry with just a Master's degree in Machine Learning. Get at most 3 years work experience before I make the decision.

&#x200B;

Concerns and Questions 1:

1. First, this idea works on paper (I really like it) and matches the time that I currently use for things like chores, cooking and sleep. However, this is a 70 hour work week for 9 years, and I don't know if I can handle that. The best thing that I can do is try.

Concerns and Questions 2:

1. Second, the 8 books comprise about 4000 readable pages. I have a maximum of 5215 hours to study over five years if I only work 40 hours a week, don't take breaks, study during 14 days PTO, and don't study during my commute. However, I will realistically only have 40 minutes average per page to fully comprehend the material and solve a significant amount of problems. I do not know if that is enough time. 
2. I can probably partially alleviate (1) by creatively using my academic paper time, and by skipping all or parts of a book(s).

What do you think about this schedule and my two concerns? Am I over planning my goals? How do you think I should approach my goals?

376,b2egvj,False,Discipline,2,Call center / service desk employees -- how leveraged do you feel is 'over-leveraged'?,jobs,"I work at a large corporation that provides great benefits and decent pay (for my locale anyhow).

Originally, I was hired on to work on their internal IT helpdesk.  While it was still crappy call-center-esque phone and email support, I still enjoyed the work because I got to talk to a lot of people, troubleshoot issues, and had a lot of autonomy to work on solutions to problems.

Over the past couple of years, though, the department has really gone down hill and has started implementing some really miserable policies (strictly scheduled lunches and breaks, metrics, 60 second wrap-up time, etc).  But we also started taking on many new external contracts -- and many of these contracts each have their very own SOP.  Some clients, besides having their own SOP, have multiple projects under them, and each project may even be handled different.  They are also all *white label*, and many of them are angry assholes (unlike internal employees).

An example would be that one client requires that we open a ticket in one ticketing system, while another requires us to use another ticketing system, except we close that ticket and then send an email.  Another might require us to some combination of steps, while yet another has two completely different SOPs depending on the time of day.  In fact, multiple clients have their own operating hours, and none of them are standardized.  There is no training, either -- we just get an email from management going, ""Hey!  New THING is going live today!  Here's a KB article!""

I spend more time digging for KB articles in three different knowledgebase systems to check for proper 'procedure' than I do fixing an issue -- even when I already know what the problem is and how to technically fix it.  I am not even exaggerating here -- my average call handling time has gone from 2 minutes to over 14 minutes.  I literally spend 10+ minutes just figuring out how to route and document the call because I'm not allowed to do that post-call.

&#x200B;

I feel like we're getting over-leveraged, and I'm tempted to approach management about it and try to think of some solutions to suggest.  But I'm also wondering if I'm just being lazy or am not coping well with change -- is this normal in a call center environment?

I work in three different ticketing systems and have so many clients that I actually can't name them all -- I think it's around 25-30, many of which have between 2-6 sub-projects -- and I manage 15 different email boxes.  I can't always depend on ""whispers"", because many callers will dial into a generic IVR and mash '0' immediately and then just expect me to know who they are and what it is they are talking about.  We're also the ""roll over"" for other service desks.

&#x200B;

**The point:**  *So -- sanity check -- is this all really over-the-top or am I just getting too old for this shit?  Should I suggest trying to dedicate agents to different projects?*

Is this common?",jobs,"My coworker had been caught deliberately falsifying his time sheets, driving Uber during work, over-billing clients, and other infractions which I thought would warrant my company, an engineering firm, firing him for cause. It got so bad that our client wouldn't even let him work on their contracts anymore. 

My company eventually fired him for ""lack of available work,"" which is BS because they were attempting to hire a new employee around the same time they fired him. Another coworker told me that they couldn't outright fire him for cause because they feared he would sue the company for discrimination or favoritism. This could have been the perception if we hired someone right after he was fired. This decision apparently came from our company's general counsel. 

The employee that was fired was African American and had been heard muttering about how the company was racist at the client's office. But the local office of my company has 17 employees, three of which are African Americans, two of whom have been there for almost 10 years.

Most of the people in the entire place can't work with her and have before - they didn't last long around her and asked to be moved, citing that they can't work with her and she's too hard to get along with. A lot of temps have come and gone under her. I'm told that I have been there the longest. Most describe her as like working with the devil. She's double-minded, will tell you to do something one way one minute and the next she'll turn on you and tell you that it wasn't the right way. She will try to say that you shouldn't listen to what others tell you because they'll stab you in the back, but she actually will do the same thing. When she makes a mistake, she plays it off and blames others. If others make a mistake, she rants and cusses at them. You can hear her screaming all over the warehouse. She frequently says she doesn't care what other departments do, but she spends her entire day ranting about the lead in the department next to us and saying stuff like, ""I wish she would shut up, I don't want to hear her voice.""  She's petty for every little thing, ridiculously OCD and thinks she's better/smarter than everyone else. She frequently says that other people ""don't have any common sense"" and the stuff she does doesn't make sense most of the time. She does things her way and backwards. Half of her shelves are not labeled properly and she expects employees to go by memory. If they don't remember, she gets mad at them. I figure that she also keeps a grip on that department by acting like she's the only one who can do it. I'm told that she has been there for a couple of years and has previously worked in a number of other departments. She insists that others call her ""queen"" (I won't do it and a number of employees won't) even though that's obviously not her name. She convinced somebody to change her time clock name to that, as well. I'm not sure why even the managers call her by that nickname. She's a low-level team lead and on the bottom in regards to management.

We have a new employee and I have been trying to tell him stuff and show him stuff to train him. She doesn't want me to help him. Doesn't want me and him to talk at all, but she'll stand there and rattle her head off to people all day. If she sees us being happy or getting along, she tries to basically interrupt and break it up with her sourness. She is so petty that when I clocked out one day and was waiting for my ride in the break room, she thought she'd stand there in the break room and make sure that anyone else didn't say anything bad to me about her. I told her that I am my own person and I don't have time for that nonsense. She's just a huge mess. Not sure if she's bipolar or what.

Nobody seems to know the ""why"" as to why she is so hard to get along with. The kicker is that a lot of the employees who claim she's hard to work with and won't work with her - they want to date her/sleep with her. They leer at her and kind of make advances at her all day, yet at the same time act like she's an awful person to be around. One coworker literally told me that she's hard to get along with because she's not sleeping with a man. I find that very hard to believe. I know that she's dating a man who was fired a while back (he was my coworker and part of a few people associated with theft from the company).

I can't see any specific link to her and anyone in upper management. They ""know"" her as an employee, but I see nothing personal. She doesn't seem to be anyone's favorite, for instance. I don't know why they keep her. At the end of the day when we're done in our department, she is also so petty that she tries to keep us from helping out (for the overtime) in other departments. I would do it anyway because I need the money and she's no longer my team lead when we're done in our department. I have even seen her ranting at my manager and my manager's manager. I don't understand it. Why won't they get rid of her?

I discussed how hard she is to get along with with a couple of managers. One of them told me, ""Yeah, queen...we've all tried to 'tame' her..."" and acted like nobody could do anything with her. They're managers for crying out loud. Every other lead says the same, too. That she's hard to get along with and that they can't work with her. What would be the liability in this case? Are they scared of a lawsuit? Scared of her somehow? I see no dirt that she could have on anyone. I'm hoping to eventually move to another department. For now, I let her insults and such go in one ear and out of the other. When I ignore her and laugh, it seems to hurt her even more. She wants someone to argue with her, it seems. While doing your job, she'll say that you ""missed"" something in the area that you're in and you haven't even had a freaking chance to get it yet. It seems to be a bug tactic. She does that all day long. ""You missed this, you missed that"" to both me and my coworker.

Eventually HR had to get involved and slowly in the background action started getting taken.  Perhaps when they say they've tried to tame her, they've  started the trail of corrective action?   Maybe not enough people are speaking out about it?  That was what caused the delay where I worked.  Everyone was afraid.

Anything else to remedy current situation would be greatly appreciated.

I’m nearing a year into my first job, my dream job. I’ve been working after hours every weekday and weekend for weeks to try to fix multiple mistakes that I've made over the last few weeks.

* I’ve accidentally abandoned projects before finishing them,
* had projects have their scope change drastically out of nowhere that I had to redo,
* had to redo projects because I made some bad decisions with them,
* have a backlog of necessary updates that grows faster than I can finish them,
* and I’m having a hard time keeping up.

It feels like I’m not seeing the forest for the trees with the amount of suggestions and changes that my work has to go through before it’s either approved or worked on. It’s almost like I have no idea what I’m doing, and on certain projects that's definitely the case.

My mentor coworker on my team wants me to work on it without announcement. That would be fine if other teams didn't need my incomplete projects to be finished and I don't know how to complete these incomplete projects. Thankfully, I've avoided that embarrassment until now, but I'm afraid it won't last. 

Living in fear that my incompetence becomes more than just a verbal, unwritten complaint; but I feel too paralyzed and embarrassed to say anything about it, especially since it won't affect just me but my mentor as well, since he's responsible for my cultivation.

**What exactly should I do?**

* Should I go over every project and what went wrong with them, and then provide a plan and timeframe for how to get each one done, even if it’ll hinder my colleagues (but what if they tell upper management who thinks I'm doing fantastic)?
* Should I only go over the ones I know I can't get done in time (but what if priorities change out of nowhere)?
* Should I speak with my mentor again to try to convince him otherwise?
* Or should I just stay silent and hope that I can pull things together without anyone noticing?
* Or maybe they have noticed but are waiting for me to say something about it?

396,6a57da,False,Discipline,53,"Suspended on Friday, probably will be terminated today and I can't even take one step",jobs,"*Edited to add:* I am in California, just to give some context.


The past three days have been nothing short of a surreal nightmare, so I will try to keep this concise and coherent.  


I have worked for my company for 7 years and in my position as a manager for 3. The company and my location are very large with many employees and my role is part of HR. I am the only person who does my job at my location and I report to a Director (and subsequently, her Director) who have never done my job before and really don't know much about it. Others in the company with my same role get to report to a Senior person in our position who is obviously very clear on the job demands and routine. Because of my unique reporting structure, I have always felt isolated, confused by the priorities and goals established by my boss, and frustrated because of the time I must spend trying to explain to them how my counterparts do things so that I can achieve alignment with them. I conduct a great deal of training in my position so it is important that I am doing this in the same manner as the other trainers in other cities.  


While I am very confident with the training aspect of my job, I have always struggled with the reporting/administrative projects I'm forced to take on as they are far more lengthy than what I have time for in a normal week. I am completely burned out, regularly working 70-80 hour weeks, and having taken no time off except for the occasional 1 day of PTO every few months for the past two years. I also go in to work (90 minute commute) or work from home at least one day every weekend. I have tried to address my workload with my boss MANY times, but was always dismissed and made to feel like I was just inadequate (by her, or by her Director, who isn't a bad person, but is often harsh and condescending) and the result was constantly being late in submitting these projects. I did receive prior warnings about my performance, and was placed on an Improvement Plan (PIP) in January, but around the same time was forced to take on the responsibilities of one of the HR Reps who had recently left as well as completely overhaul one of my main reporting procedures. Not surprisingly, I fell behind again and I was suspended on Friday afternoon and sent home (literally in tears in front of trainees I had worked with all week, which was awful) and told to return late this afternoon for the results of the ""investigation.""  


The Director has made it quite clear that the investigation will certainly result in my termination. I do not plan to fight this decision because while I believe that my failure was due to burnout and the constraints my leaders placed on me, I cannot deny the actual performance offenses for which I was written up. The Director is very combative, and always finds a way to squash any concern I try to discuss. She passively warned me never to seek out a conversation with her superior (our GM) without her knowledge and to just relay any messages for him through her. While I know a lot of this is not right, there is literally nothing I can contest that she won't find a way to dispel. That being said, I acknowledge time management is a challenge for me (I have had ADHD for as long as I can remember, and while I am treated for it, it was never disclosed at work as this is usually discouraged by ADHD professionals) and in my three years in this position, I endured my mom's terminal cancer and eventual passing away, my husband's unemployment, my husband leaving me, and then having to move all of our stuff 30 miles to a cheaper apartment with no help. My bosses are aware of most of this (no details), and I took VERY little time off for any of these rough times and even managed to stay connected with work if I was off. And while they showed a shred of sympathy once or twice, they sent a clear message that I needed to keep those personal issues out of the workplace.  


I still have the opportunity to submit a statement for this investigation, and while I feel like I owe this to myself (and my future replacement) to finally document everything that led me to fail in a job I was perfectly qualified for, I also want to just make this separation as quick and painless as possible so I can maintain my reputation and move on with my life. On one hand, I am absolutely devastated about losing a job I truly loved and horrified about losing my income (my finances are NOT in order for this by any means) as well as the crushing devastation of having to explain a firing in interviews. But the other hand, I keep feeling this rush of relief because for so long, my life has been marked by misery and exhaustion that I never fully recovered from because of my work demands... so maybe a drastic change is what will finally get things to improve (I keep trying to ignore the latter feelings because I NEED to be more worried about being fired and un-hirable. I cannot afford a ""mental break"" and its affect on my finances and future career.)  


I know I would forever regret not making a sincere effort to try and save my job at this point by writing this statement, but ultimately, if they want me gone, I just want to accept it with as much dignity as possible. There are some people in the company who believe in me, and I would love the possibility to return someday to work with them. So I don't know which direction to go with the statement, or even where to start.  

**TL:DR - After three years of work overload, exhaustion, and endless stress from my leaders which destroyed both my performance and my self-esteem, I was suspended on Friday and facing likely termination.

Career-wise I have been utilized a lot as a fixer, someone that can come in to a bad situation and get things turned around quickly.

Lean Six Sigma is a bit better than plain SS, since it empowers the entire organization, rather than keeping the magic in the hands of a few statisticians.  Organizations like how it can motivate the masses, and even if only partially adopted it can add significant value. Six Sigma *without the lean* is more of an all or nothing, my way or the highway attidude that only works when senior management is fully onboard.

PMP is the defacto 'gold standard' when it comes to project management credentials. Unlike L6S, is is exclusive and proprietary to the PMI organization (with L6S you have several strong choices for certification).  PMP is a tough exam, and rumour has it that they maintain a 50% failure rate to keep it elite. 

Unfortunately, PMI has double-downed on its emphasis of Agile methologies into it's flagship PMP credential, which may stengthen it in IT circles, but at the same time distance it in relevance to other industries where Agile has not caught on and likely never will, such as Construction, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Advertising, and Event Planning.

Unfortunately, nothing has emerged to challenge PMP dominance in the PM certification space...

So, are you are looking for a credential for immediate impact, PMP will do the trick - but there is a growing dissatisfaction in what it represents... so, tomorrow - who knows.

As L6S has grown in popularity within Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Health Care, it has lost favor in IT and technology integration...

-Interview I had conducted as part of a work experience programme

Personally I had a lot of samples from various internships, but if you don't have any, don't be afraid to add your guest blog posts or a written sample from your law days (any technical content you created for them might help!). Of course if your guest blog posts match up if the interests of the companies you're applying for, that's even better. 

I think what really stands out is to make sure your writing samples are technically sound and you at least have a good vocabulary. At a higher level, some places might want you to have a distinct voice (either for the company or yourself) to make your work stand out, but I wouldn't say too worry too much about that at the start.

I know this is kind of a weird question to post and I’m more then certain that many managers or owners of their own businesses would never admit to this, but I’m genuinely curious as to how some of you feel after hiring someone with a disability and seeing them perform their job duties very slowly. I ask this, because I’m a person who has a physical disability (mitochondrial myopathy) that limits my movement and I sometimes feel like I’m slowing everyone down. That saying of; “time is money” always runs through my mind whenever I feel or see my managers eyes watching me as I go about my job duties. I work in a small retail store and though, I know that this job isn’t particularly a right fit for someone who suffers from my illness, I needed something to generate revenue and I WAS NOT going to depend on SSI or the government at the age of 24 to take care of me because I truly believe I can at least do a simply entry level job. Anyway, as I was saying, I work very slowly at times due to fatigue and not being able to carry heavy loads and every time my manager and I talk, I feel like there’s some type of animosity because I truly believe he/she regrets hiring me but doesn’t want to fire me due to the fear of me suing for wrongful termination under the ADA law. Also I want to add that they knew I had a disability prior to them hiring me. My question lies in; As a manager (anyone in this sub) do you ever regret hiring someone who suffers from a disability because you feel their slowing down the work flow?

Honestly I would kill for a job in technical writing.

I don't know if this is right, but it's what I'm doing: put all of your creative projects/portfolios at the top of your resume with hyperlinks to your work and leave off any irrelevant jobs you might have held unless it's your only paid work experience. I've been applying thinking you have to put paid work experience first, but I'm beginning to realize that if you don't have relevant experience (personal projects ARE experience) on the top third of your resume, hiring managers send you straight to the reject pile without so much as glancing at anything on the bottom 2/3 of the resume or looking at additional writing samples/portfolios you might send with your application. (Seriously, HR people seem to be the laziest, most clueless people I've ever had to deal with; you basically have to spell out everything for them on your resume like they're 3 years old. They want their jobs to be easy, so make it easy for them by front-loading the crap out of your resume with work examples.)

I think in this industry, demonstrating that you can write creative content is perhaps the most important thing. It shows employers what skill set you already possess and what you're capable of. I can't tell you what marketing managers might be looking for, but in my experience looking at job postings, most of them want at a bare minimum demonstrated proficiency with WordPress, AP style (or occasionally Chicago style), professional-looking photographs, some familiarity with HTML and CSS, and most of them also want to see that you have experience managing social media pages for a company (in this situation I've simply made social media pages to correspond with my blog). Upper-entry level positions might want anything from video editing experience, web design experience, graphic design experience, and/or require you to be an ""expert"" with certain software like Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, or Photoshop. Startups and small to mid-sized companies seem to have more relaxed experience requirements; large companies usually seem to want everything I mentioned above for the most basic entry-level positions, plus administrative, HR, and data analysis experience and a bunch of other random stuff on the side.

Edited to add - I don't know how much companies care about blog views, but I think it would only help you. I only get a few dozen views per blog post on mine, but then again I'm writing about a recreational ice hockey league in an area that doesn't give a crap about ice hockey. I think it's probably more important that you show you can do the work, and the work speaks for itself. ",2020-06-05 18:21:00

The career field you want to enter is called ""student affairs."" In addition to admissions, it comprises all student services: housing, counseling, conduct, Greek life, and so on.

Virtually all jobs in student affairs are master's-required. If you want to have a chance, you will need to get a specific student affairs master's degree. Unfortunately, your food science master's degree will not help you one bit in this field.

Luckily, most master's programs in student affairs will accept students from any background - as long as you can articulate on your application that you are passionate about helping college students, you'll be golden. People who work in higher ed come from all kinds of backgrounds. It's an extemely diverse field, and prides itself on being so diverse.

A few warnings: it's a very competitive field. You'll probably spend a few years while in grad school overworked and underpaid as an ""intern"" (even though your responsibilities and hours will be comparable to a professional), and then still might to struggle to get a job after all the effort. 

In addition, I hope you aren't attached to where you live, because it will be expected that you do a national job search after graduating. If you are selective about which colleges you apply to for full-time work, you will just be holding yourself back. Take whatever you can get, anywhere in the country. Some people end up working at the same college where they got their master's, or in the same area, or at the college in the next town over - but many people do not - so be open to traveling. Furthermore, promotions are rare, so once you have learned all you need to from a job, be ready to move across the country yet again to take on a higher-level position.

If that kind of workload, and those warnings, don't bother you, then absolutely go for it.

And if you want to know more, go to your current school's career services office and make an appointment. I can almost guarantee you that every career counselor went through a student affairs master's program, and they can tell you what the career field is like.

One last thing: the student affairs field is made up of so many people that you'll really have to come to your own conclusions. I'm trying to be a realist here, but some people will say it's only positive and fun, some will say you don't actually need a master's, and some people are extremely toxic. Everyone who works in student affairs has a different perspective about it. 

Sorry not sorry for the long answer. Consider yourself informed.

I guess my dream job would be some sort of proofreading / copy editing, but those are also hard to come by for someone without experience, and internships are too risky at this stage in my life now (and mostly only open to students).

Does anyone have any tips for someone without actual experience trying to get into another field? I’m not even super picky about the field, I just want to find something that isn’t customer-service focused.

* Research what are the starting position (entry level) job in the field you want to enter, and find the job titles. Then search for those titles and apply to the jobs that require no or very little experience. 
* People are always talking about professional organizations or networking events. I don't know how to get into these but its an idea. 
* Try to connect with recruiters or managers in the field. 

It seems like you can't really enter a new field these days, because the market is so oversaturated with qualified, experienced candidates that they won't consider a new person. If you know somebody who can vouch for you that seems to be practically the only way to get 90% of jobs.

Unless you are hiring for a senior, executive, or maybe manager position... please stop requiring every job above minimum wage to already have 3-10 years experience in that exact field.

It’s so unfair to qualified (as in meets all other job requirements such as the college degree and skills required) millennials struggling on minimum wage straight out of college because you require years of experience for something college already prepared and qualified us for. 

And don’t call us whiners for calling it unfair when I know for a fact boomers got similar jobs to today straight out of college. Employers are not being fair to the last decade of college graduates by doing this. Most of these employers themselves got their job way back when such specific experience wasn’t a factor.

And to add onto this:
Employers that require any college degree for a job but only pay that job minimum wage are depressingly laughable. That is saying your want someone’s college skills but you don’t think they deserve to be able to pay off their student debt.

This is why millennials are struggling.
You people make it so most of us HAVE to struggle. Stop telling us we aren’t trying hard enough when your rules literally make it impossible for us to even get started.

We cannot use our degrees to work and earn more money if you won’t even let us get started.

THAT is why so many people are struggling and why so many of us are depressed. Being five years out of college, still working minimum wage, because a job won’t hire you because you don’t already have experience for the job you’re completely otherwise qualified for.

I want to quit and move back home to my extended family and my husband and my cute little house, but I feel like I will be stuck in a low level position at one of the few shops there if I stay in the industry.

What I would love to do is start my own shop, but financially that's not really in the cards at the moment. How the hell do I leverage my skills (painting, fiberglass, bondo/bodywork, small powertools) into a better paying job so we can pay down some school debts, rebuild our savings (that I basically ruined by moving out here), and eventually get to a point where I can realize my dream of running my own shop?

My other, non-art related skills are experience with word/excel, a knack for googling and ability to troubleshoot most minor computer problems, experience with most Adobe suite products (in particular PS and Illustrator, with some knowledge of InDesign), and fairly strong written communication skills (lit minor in college)..

I'm not even looking for a job in my industry anymore. Just something that pays well that I can jump into without much training, that has half decent benefits, where I can hit my 40 and go home to try and plan out my future business. What should I be looking for?

469,ex3vl2,False,Qualifications,3,"Phone Interview Monday. How can I make a case of my work experience, even though I was fired from my last job?",jobs,"Hello Reddit,

I have a question regarding work experience as I’m currently job hunting. 

I’ve been fired from my last job as a assistant fashion designer as of December 2019. I’ve had this job since mid October so roughly 2 months.

I was also also working part time in evenings during this time but only as a seamstress.

As an assistant fashion designer, I did tech packs for the company that included fabric type, trim info, colour way, etc. We then send my tech pack to one of our suppliers in China with a sample. 

The sample and the actual product that I designed in the tech pack comes back and we make revisions. This means I have to update the measurement spec sheet. This goes along with doing a fitting where someone wears the product I’ve made and then we make adjustments and send it back to China where hopefully all the mistakes were corrected. 

So everything I’ve mentioned here is the basis of being an assistant fashion designer or technical designer in the fashion industry.

Since job hunting, a lot of companies are looking for a year experience or more in terms of technical design.

Since I only had a technical job for 2 months, and I’ve been fired, I was wondering where else could I put that experience in my resume?

The only experience that I have that are slightly similarly related to that was my seamstress jobs or my job as a student entrepreneur where I made my own clothing, or my time in college where I learned these things. 

I guess what I’m asking is, what is the best case I can make for myself that I do have some experience as a assistant fashion designer/technical designer without mentioning that my last job that I was fired?

Applicants must be highly proficient with MS Word, Excel, Outlook, Acrobat Pro; be skilled in minute-taking and have a typing speed of 50wpm. Other requirements include the ability to work under pressure and meet tight deadlines; demonstrate excellent written and verbal communication skills while exhibiting tact and diplomacy; be detail-oriented and maintain productivity while working in a sometimes distracting environment; offer excellent internal/external customer service; and work effectively in a team-oriented environment. Applicants must be adept at multi-tasking and balancing a varying workload with competing priorities; and be knowledgeable in general office procedures and practices.
 
Applicants must be able to attend off-site meetings and record accurate and comprehensive minutes of these and other meetings. Applicants must have the ability to lift and carry light to moderate weight objects; move chairs, tables and other meeting equipment into place; and test, set-up and operate audio-visual and recording equipment required for public meetings.

This is usually a very experienced development officer (fundraiser), who is good at identifying the donors' interests and giving capacity and finds a way to connect it to a major funding opportunity.  

It's a long process -- up to a couple of years, in part because tax issues are often involved -- and it is essentially a weird form of sales. What you are selling is the satisfaction of doing good to a rich person who's got money to spare and maybe wants to be remembered for more in life than building a lot of luxury apartment buildings.  

One of our old major donors just passed; he was a former engineer turned real estate developer, and his donations alone laid the foundation for a real engineering division at our otherwise liberal-arts-heavy university.  It of course has his name on it.

Development officers are often ""guns for hire"" who drift from university to university; but some of them come up from the ranks of university administration -- usually by getting involved with fundraising for whatever department or program they work for -- and go from there. 

I would actually encourage you to look at university employment.  I don't know what ""macro"" social work is, but the university I work for has actual social workers on staff, a variety of student assistance prorams, a food program, a ""student success"" program, advising positions of various types beyond simple academic advising, and more.

As someone in this industry who has a job like the one you’re looking for; I’d recommend doing a certified course on the Abobe Creative Suite, especially Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. Those are the three key programs you’ll be using.

482,f3drlz,False,Qualifications,2,I'd prefer to leave by job and work elsewhere in Accounting since it's what I taught myself but I don't feel my knowledge is legit nor do I feel educationally qualified.,jobs,"So I'm reaching out today because I've decided to quit my job sometime in the future but I haven't the slightest idea how to quit or even how to begin looking elsewhere for work since I have, what I feel, is basically nothing to show potential employers. Like, I understand I do a lot and both my boss and my co-workers routinely tell me I'm ""not allowed to leave"" and if I do, ""the company won't last ten years."" It's always said with a solemn tone and tbh I'm a little tired if hearing it.

I'm 30 years old. I've been at this company nearly six years. I was hired through a temp agency. I have never had a different job nor have I ever had an interview. I have learned a lot through this company though. For the sake of easier reading, I'll try to bullet point this out.

- I spent the first two years working as a grunt in the production department. The boss and I got along about as well as oil and water and our screaming matches could often be heard over the deafening sounds of the machines. Nevertheless, I was kept because I often out-worked my co-workers. What took them three days to complete, took me only one. I'm not saying this to brag; it's what was told me as the sole reason for hiring me and what continues to be the reason as to why they keep me on.
- Due to the irreconcilable differences between the boss and I, HR (who doubles as my current boss) intervened and gave me a position in the office. Due to having zero prior job experience and zero education (other than a GED which I don't have a copy of), I was supposed to be their filing clerk. This company still uses an outdated paper filing system so I have six large rooms I must maintain to ensure every employee can find the paperwork they're looking for. I must also cull through the files at the end of each year because we only keep seven years worth.
- Two weeks after my transfer another employee unexpectedly quit. Her Accounts Payables duties were split between me and another co-worker. My new partner received all of the training from the departing co-worker because she already had prior experience. I didn't get any training whatsoever. Unfortunately I soon discovered my new partner felt this was entirely unfair and she should not be required to do these duties. It has been an astronomical learning curve but over these past four years I've taken away from her nearly every single aspect of Payables and single-handedly run this dept myself. The only thing I don't do is print the checks each month.
- 3 weeks ago my boss informed me that this same co-worker has been discovered to be slacking in her Receivables duties for the past three years. It is now my job to rectify our customer's accounts of their past due balances and open credits. No, I will not receive any training nor will my co-worker be punished. This is a moot point anyways because I have already resolved all of the accounts.
- Because a different co-worker is getting older in years, I have also been rather unceremoniously tossed into the position of being a back-up receptionist. I answer calls, transfer folks where they need to be, take messages, etc.
- In addition to these duties, I also do a lot of things which go unnoticed by my boss. I have a lot of freedom in my position tbh. I print labels, I type up paperwork, I maintain our first aid cabinets, I have the flexibility and training to help in multiple departments (inventory control, production, and shipping) due to me being tossed in those departments any time my ex-boss and I were fighting, I can receive in mail, I order products for various projects I need and charge them to my co-workers company's credit card, etc.

I guess my fear is that I may have my GED but I technically did not progress past the 9th grade so I don't feel well educationally qualified. I don't have the funds to go back to school. A lot of what I do know, I've taught myself but I don't even feel confident in this knowledge because this company is ridiculously outdated. (We still use electric typewriters on a daily basis except for my co-worker who still uses a real, old-fashioned typewriter.) This company is family-run and well respected in its field so I do have that going for me though.

If I looked for another job, would I even be considered for an Accounting position? How would I even explain to potential new employers the extent of what I do know without it sounding so far left-field (which is how I feel like it comes across)? I am currently paid nearly twice the current minimum wage. Could I get this again if I left and became employed elsewhere? Honestly I'd rather not stay in this wretched place any longer than need be but I never thought I'd want to leave so desperately. Until this past year, I have never really thought about it. Now that it is in my thoughts every day though, I'm completely at a loss on what to do, what to expect, or where to even start. And should I even leave? How would I present this to my boss who, I know, would be distraught? I'm sure they'll ask me what it'll take me to stay so how I can say it's just time for me to move on? (The motto of this company is, ""It'll drive you to drink,"" which is what I'm currently struggling with as well because my drinking has increased ten-fold. This has been incredibly detrimental to my mental health but I've been reluctant to leave because I need the money.) Am I even required to give them a reason on why I'm leaving? Finally, when I leave for a week or more, at least five co-workers must step in and cover for me so do I need to let my boss know more than two weeks in advance before I quit?

I've decided to omit my social work license and master's degree from this resume. However, my past 3 years of work experience only involve doing psychotherapy.

I've managed to reframe my therapy jobs to properly suit the position I want. However, my two internships during grad school were purely psychotherapy, and it would border on dishonest to describe them as anything otherwise. Thus, I'm left with a dilemma:

1. Omit the internships and have a two-year gap on my resume. I could explain this away by saying that I was in grad school. They may ask, however, why then I didn't include my master's on my resume.

2. Include the internships. But then again, they may ask why I didn't include my master's on my resume and it might appear that I failed to graduate.

497,eps99j,False,Qualifications,1,"Should I spend nearly $5k to obtain certifications in an industry I am not yet in, but want to get into?",jobs,"So with my job, I am in a unique position.  I have a few years experience in a regulatory entity, with over a year specific to financial services regulation and policymaking.  About a year ago, dismayed by my current salary and future salary potential at my employer, began looking for other jobs on the side.  My role is most akin to a compliance role in a financial services firm, and out of all the applications I have sent out over the year, I have gotten the furthest with bank compliance roles.  This would be great, as my salary would increase by 50-100%, I would receive better benefits (employer pays towards student debt and future tuition, etc) and the role would honestly probably be easier and more streamlined compared to what I do now.  I know for sure I can do the role and many of my skills and experience match up.  

Notice how I said ""have gotten the furthest with"" as I haven't been able to seal the deal as of yet.  I will provide three brief examples of this.  With my first opportunity, I got past the screening and made it to the interview, but was ultimately passed for another individual.  This was at a mid-sized credit union with a lot of exposure in my state.  My second opportunity I passed on, because the job would've required a move to another state and I was unsure if I wanted to make the move into compliance or instead explore other options.  I passed the screening and was invited for the interview, but ultimately passed on it.  This was at a well known investment bank, as well.

I am currently going through my third opportunity for a manager role at a regional community bank; I was initially surprised that they got back to me, as they scheduled a video screening the day after I submitted my application, and I don't have actual compliance experience.  The next day they asked for a remote video meeting with the head of the department, as the job is about 2 hours away.  The interview went well, but right off the bat the head explained they had a more compliance experienced person in mind, but wanted to learn more about my role because what I do is extremely similar.  That was yesterday, and while it went well, this position was a long shot in my mind and I am surprised I made it this far.  I even explained that I would be willing to obtain certifications ***before*** starting to assuage any anxieties over my exposure to the actual duties and responsibilities.

I am starting to realize that my resume and cover letter intrigue employers which gets me in the door, my experience in a familiar role gets me past the screening, but the fact that what I do is similar but not exactly what the role requires is made apparent during the interview.

At this point, making the move into this industry seems to be my best option, and I can actually provide insight into strategies and improve operations.  I am considering going full steam ahead into getting industry specific compliance certification(s) so there is concrete evidence that I would know what I am doing.  I would be more qualified and feel more comfortable applying for ""Senior Analyst"" or ""Manager"" roles. 

The issue is that, each certification can cost $1,500 - $2,965, which is a considerable amount of money to me out of pocket.  I can't apply traditional student loans for these industry certifications either, so I would either need a private education loan, max out credit cards, save up over the next few months, or get a loan from family.  

Given the fact that these employers are already taking me seriously with my current qualifications, is it advisable to pay out of pocket or take a small loan to cover the costs for an industry certification(s)?  At the moment I am looking at three options:

1. Obtain a more specific certification from a smaller professional association which would only count towards continuing education credits, not a designation ($1,500)
2. Obtain two certifications, both of which come from the most recognized professional association in the industry, and count towards the most well recognized designation ($4,790 for both)
3. Obtain only one of the aforementioned certifications from (2), which would still count towards the designation but not as much as both combined. ($2,095-$2,695 depending on which one) 

It's also important to note that, I could finish any 1 or 2 of these certifications within two weeks because I am already familiar with the subject matter, but less so implementation of strategy.  Further, I am holding off on pursuing a certification until I hear back from my current manager opportunity, because they could either provide them for free or give me the industry discount.  

Does anyone have experience obtaining industry specific certifications ***before*** entering said industry?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/eps99j/should_i_spend_nearly_5k_to_obtain_certifications/,2,"Nope, I would just keep going with the interviews and not worry about the certs.

She should keep in constant contact with the instructors so that they can help her as much as possible. The courses can be online or just short workshops but they're important as a ""reset"" in her career. She should keep that server experience in her resume to show what she did for the last 3 years and then also show the certificates/classes/workshops she took afterwards. Most employers I know in this industry assume that anyone who just has a degree and no relevant job experience needs to be fully trained so your friend should be mostly on par with other freshly-graduated candidates. She should ask the instructors she developed good connections with to go over her resume and forward her any entry level jobs they might know of. 

Then she should apply for some entry-level positions in her field of study (Craigslist often has a bunch). These are mostly low-level technician jobs where people just follow established guidelines (mostly preparing solutions, cleaning glassware, ordering lab supplies, doing basic assays), but that doesn't matter so long as it's slightly relevant to her career. Analytical chemistry is actually pretty good for people who just have a B.S. degree in chemistry/biology and you can easily get on-the-job training and grow your skillset.

I always got A’s and B’s. I took 12 AP classes. My mom is a healthcare attorney and my dad is a software engineer. I am incredibly privileged in numerous ways. I think that in part has led to some entitlement. In May, I graduated from Case Western Reserve University. I dual majored in Mathematics and Psychology, and dual minored in Sociology and Childhood Studies. In college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I majored in math to please my mom and everything else I did just because I enjoyed it. Looking back I would definitely major in business or actuarial sciences. 

Anyway, I graduated in May with a 3.3 GPA. For the 6 months prior, I applied relentlessly to every job under the sun. Human Resources, Data Analysis, everything! I love stats and data and working with people. But was declined by everyone. I ended up getting a job with a major insurance company as.... a customer service representative. 

I’ve had this job for 5 months now. I have excelled and am already bored. I don’t feel like I can relate to my coworkers. I make $16.50 an hour. I feel humbled but also frustrated. I love everyone here but this isn’t *ME!* I don’t feel challenged here, I don’t see the opportunity to grow. Most of my co-workers are living on minimum wage and I can’t even relate because I saved up $25,000 working throughout high school and college and being supported in many ways by my parents. 

I feel like an idiot writing this. I feel like everyone will hate me and think I sound like an entitled brat. Which I probably am. But has anyone been in a similar situation? How can I get past customer service? How can I get employers to take me seriously? I am taking 2 accounting classes at a community college, I am teaching myself SQL, and I’m studying for my first actuarial exam. 

Everyone around me is telling me I can do better than customer service. But it sure doesn’t feel like it. I’m embarrassed to tell people I work in CS, and I hate that I feel that way.

The question coming up might be broad, but I could not find any satisfactory answer in an existing post so far (because you know, specifics), so I thought I'd ask around for enlightenment.

Long story short, I am now in my mid-30's, decided to quit my job in one of the Big 4 tech companies after 12 years, and while I'm not yet at the point where I want to go back to an office job straight away, I'd love to hear your opinion and  experiences on the topic.

\- Dropped out of uni before the end of my BSC in computer science and industrial programming (yeah great move I know)

\- Jumped immediately into a Tech support / Customer service rep role for the next 3 years.

\- Spent the next 8 years in 2 different management positions (In B2B support), still in the Tech support/Customer service area, with job responsibilities heavy on Coaching/Leadership and Admin/Reporting, with months-long missions in Recruitment and Operations.

\- 5 Months in a UX/UI analyst role afterwards. I maintained a decent IT background throughout the management career (particularly on Network technologies, Mobile Device management and programming), which probably helped landing this job.

\- Native French speaker, pretty much native-level English fluency at this point too. I understand Italian/Spanish/Dutch fairly well, fluency in either of these 3 would be a matter of months practicing.

\- Interest in and good understanding of Finance/Stock market.

And this is where I am.

My worry at this point is that customer care/tech support careers seem to be a good path to ... another customer care job, which is and industry i'd preferably steer clear of. Most of my network left our company for another Customer care department, and I'm just not sure what roles this job prepared me for outside of it exactly. While leadership is an important skill in itself in my opinion, I am not too sure about the job market for a management position outside of my field of expertise. Also, the fact that I did not graduate can be an issue, as some companies/countries/roles will enforce strict degree requirements, while for others work experience can make up for it.

So in a nutshell my question is: What's your experience with your career after call center / call center management careers, or any thoughts/recommendations you would have based on my profile. 

Finally, I'm willing to relocate outside of Europe (the last 2 gigs were in Ireland/Netherlands), with a preference for HK/Singapore or if stars align for it find a location independent job.

TIA :)

516,bjwuym,False,Qualifications,29,I'm being laid off around August but a friend has given me the chance at a great job that is in line with what I do now. The only problem is that I feel under qualified for one important aspect of the job. Should I be fully transparent when I send my email/resume?,jobs,"I want to keep this as short and to the point as I can but I also want to give as much information about my situation as I can so I apologize in advance if this post is long. I will put a TL;DR at the end just in case!

So, for the past 7 years I've been doing Data Entry and Medical Coding (ICD-10/CPT/etc) for a group of doctors. My mom is the head Medical Biller/boss with her own company so she offered me the job when I was fresh out of high school. I took the job for a lot of reasons (I could have money for college, I could help my mom out, no interview process, I could build up job experience, etc).

Cut to March of this year. Turns out the doctors are being forced to outsource their billing due to new changes/policies/laws so our entire office is being laid off. Two of my three coworkers had their last day on April 30th so it's just me, my mom and one other coworker left. My last coworker is probably leaving in July and I'm essentially expected to stay till August or September to help my mom tie up loose ends until the transition to the outsourcing company is complete. It's been a stressful process because it's forcing a lot of changes into everyone's lives (EX: my mom has been here for 24 years and she's being forced to close down her business in general as a result of this)

I vented to some of my friends about being laid off and one friend came back to me a few weeks later saying that a Medical Billing position just opened up at her workplace and they are desperate to find someone. I told her I can't start at a new place until August at the earliest. Yesterday she told me that she told her boss that I wouldn't be able to start for another few months but her boss is so desperate that she said that that is fine. My friend was also saying that all the people who have applied recently have had 0 experience so they really want me to send in my resume. Her boss essentially wants me to email my resume directly to her so it doesn't get lost in the stream of resumes on their job application site. This is all fine and dandy but I told my friend that I only know basic Medical Billing (from when my mom would ask me to help her with her workload) and that my main job was data entry and coding. She reassured me that they need someone to do coding in general for the job and that I could probably ask other billers who work for their company (in different offices) for help if I'm stuck.

She sent me the link to the actual job posting and the benefits, location, hours and the ""minimum requirements"" all seem to be in line with what I want/have/need. I'm just really hung up on the Medical Billing aspect of the job. I don't want to present myself as someone who knows what I'm doing in that area when I don't because I know it would just lead to a lot of problems and anxiety in the end. But at the same time, I also don't want to potentially lose out on a great opportunity just because I'm a ""little"" under qualified for the job (by their standards). I don't want to shoot myself in the foot before I even start by saying too much early on.

Should I just be fully transparent and give 100% full disclosure in my email to the boss? I'm not sure if there is an interview process after this but, if there is, should I wait till then to let the boss know?

**TL;DR:** I'm getting laid off around August/September from my job of 7 years.

I've been cleaning for myself for about 25 years. I have a job lined up starting next summer. In the meantime I've taken work cleaning with a guy I've known for years. He started a company a couple years ago. I'm a pretty quiet person, and I don't mind doing things a different way if my employer wants me to. But he.....well, doesn't have a clue what he's doing. He's got huge contracts with a bunch of employees. He's not mean at all, but just says things like 'no, no, no, do it this way'. I should add there is a bit of a language/cultural barrier too. And when I say he's doing things wrong, it's not just a different way - he's putting chemicals that take wax off the floor over time - things like that. If I bring it up, he just sort of interrupts and tells me his experience with it.

 This came to a bit of a head the other night when he asked me how much I'd charge to strip a certain floor. He proceeded to tell me 'no, you charge far too much - market value is half of that at the most'. No discussion, even when I said I've been doing this for a long time and never had trouble with work. 

In addition to all of this, he works like he's in a panic. And he's usually hovering right by me, watching everything I do while he works too. I'll be mopping a floor, and he will come up, tell me to go start the next section and take the mop  instead of letting me finish up. It's all incredibly frustrating for me. 

I can't help but wonder if this is all because I'm used to working on my own or if he's truly hard to work with. I know some other people avoid working with/for him because he drives them crazy. The guy would give you the shirt off his back, but he's just a bit too manic for me. And he has a bunch of jobs. Probably works about 12 or more hours a day, 7 days a week. 

Since I start another job next summer, I can't very well go out and get my own contracts. I'm seriously thinking about taking a full time job somewhere around town, even if it doesn't pay that well, just to get away from working for him. I should add I'm not exactly making much with him. Although I have a suspicion I get paid more than his other employees (some are from his home country, and he tries to give them work usually).

Your pay doesn’t change based on what part of the job you are doing, so you are ticking seconds off your life stressing about something that doesn’t matter.

My brother isn't exceptionally passionate about any form of art. He loves music, but never showed an interest in pursuing it as a career. He is also generally introverted, but exudes personality in any setting, thinks beyond his years, but lacks the vigor and drive to make things happen. He also doesn't put too much effort into studies, until it's last minute. I think he can do really well if he does. What he lacks is a goal to work towards.

Now to his positives: He has always been exceptionally good at reaching jaw dropping levels in games, and he's been really good at chess. He is also physically fit, and has all the determination to push himself to the limits. I've thought that the navy or army would suit him. 

Does anybody have any kind of advice to offer in his regards? What could suit his skills the best, to which I encourage him to put his efforts to succeed?

Here is the situation if you’re bored and want to read about my problem(?): 

Our intern couldn’t even hole punch pages properly for document binder that was meant to go out to a client...It’s gross to me because my boss hired this person only because my boss knows the intern’s parents. We got a ton of resumes and portfolios from people with much more talent/attention to detail and educational experience. 

I know I’m being too harsh. I think I really resent people who get all their opportunities because of who their parents are but actually don’t deserve it at all. This is a total waste of my energy but I can’t let it go (wtheck should I be posting this on r/mentalhealth)?

The intern is brand new and only in their 2nd year of college, but people in our line of work have to be extremely detail oriented to avoid expensive mistakes. This type of sloppy work would not even be ok in school.

Why am I so annoyed at this? Am I projecting my own insecurities on this poor person or am I just exhausted by the entitled, useless people of this rich area I am forced to work in because it’s the only area I can find jobs in my profession? 

Thank you for reading my insanity. Please share any helpful thoughts - I think I’m losing it and being very petty, but am curious if other people have ever felt this way about something small at work. I should have used the time I took to write this to finish my work lol the irony

Y’all have been leaving some helpful and encouraging comments - I really appreciate it, thank you!

&#x200B;

Basically I've found a local company that is looking for someone that does, basically, graphic design. I've been looking to make a career move recently but have floundered in my current frustrations (and being swamped with current work).

&#x200B;

I'm an artist with a focus more in illustration than in web graphics, and I know Photoshop and basic Illustrator. This position doesn't list specific program knowledge, but they certainly use AfterEffects (which I have no knowledge of) and WordPress (also not knowledgeable). The best thing I feel I have going for me is that I really love what I have seen of their   company culture and feel like I'd be a good fit. I've also been an artist my entire life, professionally freelanced for a few years, and have a pretty good understanding of basic design principles (no degree, which they list as a requirement).

&#x200B;

But, I don't want to be one of those horror stories- the ""We hired someone a few months back who got the spot \*\*somehow\*\*, but she really is clueless"" - and put myself in an unstable position as a result. Alternatively, this could be a way into a career I finally feel passionate about (sorry, customer service, I don't think you're it anymore), and the company works a lot with local businesses, which I care about more than I thought I would.

I'm almost completed my degree in B.Comm (Commerce) and I do have past experience in event planning and marketing (all through volunteering). Now I'm trying to find a job in my field (MIS, marketing, supply chain, and project coordination mainly) but I got nothing so far. I have applied to 60+ jobs and got only 1 interview. I also applied to internships last year and also this year but got nothing.

I got my resume and cover letter checked multiple times and I have been applying across Ontario but with no success. Now I'm looking at these jobs (even for entry level) and it makes me realize I have no skills or qualifications to make me remotely qualified for the job. All I really have to go off of is a degree with no relevant real skills. Apparently my volunteer work counts as nothing/is not valuable.

Now, I live in a small city with not a lot of jobs in my field so I was very open to relocating and applying everywhere across my province. However, I need to move out by early August **NO MATTER WHAT** (abusive family issues) and it's June already and I can't finalize a rental until I find a job. My city, since it's small, living off of minimum wage is feasible, however in the bigger city where all the jobs are for my field it will be a struggle because cost of living is very high there.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking about just giving up already because August is around the corner and I have no rental set for August. Thinking about just living off of minimum wage until god knows when because it doesn't look like I'm getting a job in my field any time soon. Feels like it's too late because rentals are going ASAP for august and I really need a place.

But all this has got me thinking, how do people even get their first job right out of university with no internship experience? I feel like it's almost impossible. I feel very trapped and that I will never get out of minimum wage. I feel like I have nothing to really go off of other than a degree.

Bit of background about me: 
Did my undergrad in Industrial Engineering in a 3rd world country. I worked for a couple months in manufacturing then moved to data analysis and then business analyst (3 different jobs) in 3 years.
I then decided to pursue a Masters in business analytics and big in europe.

I am now doing an internship in a big ecommerce company as an Analyst (includes business and data).

They have offered me a job as soon as the internship ends but I've been seriously considering not taking it, mostly because I feel so underskilled compared to my peers.

I linkedin stalked them and they're ALL cum laudes with CS backgrounds and consultants from very prestigious consultancy firms. Tableau, oracle and everything certified. Even before the stalking I could tell these guys were in another level.

I was very sincere since the initial interviews about my background and skills. I barely know SQL (which I learned in one of my previous jobs), and I've been struggling with stuff they do so easily. It's making me think I might not meet their expectations in the long run. It doesn't help we're the same age or they're younger than me.

I've dealt with Impostor Syndrome before and managed to convince myself that they hired me for a reason. But this time I'm really doubting myself if I belong here.

I don't want to go back to my country as the situation is not great and I'll probably feel as a failure if I do. I'm not getting any other offers anywhere and I'm having all these doubts about staying in this company.

There are a few options that you could do here and different perspectives you can use.  
  
A) Your other employees have a different mindset than you and you come from a different background. You come from the business world and they’ve come from cs and big companies. Different viewpoints help a company as a whole and you being young to this job (because you’re an intern), you’re not expected to know everything, just a higher general understanding. Maybe on your free time try to learn SQL or other useful skills that could help not only this job, but potential future ones.  
  
B) Talk to your boss and see why he offered you a job to provide some like so you can improve your self doubt. Maybe try mental health consulting if you think you need it (I am just going off of the imposter syndrome you explained).  
  
C) Ask for help from a coworker or two to help train you more? Since you don’t want to move back, view this as some money is better than no money. Think of what tasks you do on a daily basis that you could do better and practice them.  
  
Motivational bit: If you’ve been lucky enough to be selected by them twice, once for interview and once for a job offer, they clearly see something in you that you don’t.

Ok, so I’ve been tending bar for almost two years at a country club after ten years out of the workforce.  I’m 43, technically deaf but I have two cochlear implants now (that I didn’t have two years ago) and hear really well considering.  I love my workplace but I think they don’t realize my full potential because they know me more as the quiet deaf girl.  

Thing is, I owned my own graphic design business for five years and was really successful in my market.  Managed to get on the first page of google organic search results for my keywords.  I got burnt out with that and sold it after I met my husband.  We’re separated now.  In that ten years I had SSDI approved because of the deafness.  In that ten years I’ve also had a few other diagnosis and was pretty sick, had brain surgery, blah blah.  In any case, I was lucky the place hired me because I needed the work and I can handle the physical aspect for the most part.  They could only give me part time because the day bartender needs to be able to answer the phone.  I can do that now, with specialized equipment.  They’re willing to purchase it.  I don’t really want to work full time there because it’s really boring during the day, pay is tip share and fluctuates so much it’s hard to budget.

In January I reduced my hours for an opportunity to work at home again,  but it didn’t work out.  Boss ghosted me and I haven’t been paid for my work in April, so I’m back at bar with as many hours as they will give me.

Prior to my design business, I worked as an AlohaPOS software (table service and quick service restaurant software) support manager and project manager for five years.  I did pretty much everything including hardware repair, staging, training, installation, network wiring, remote and on site support.  I also trained on the same software for a large corporate rollout.  I set up a company wide oracle CRM which improved our customer service and response/resolution times.

I’ve been looking for Aloha jobs specifically on Indeed and LinkedIn.  Problem is it’s been ten years since I’ve worked with it.  I am also self taught with Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, illustrator, Bridge.  

I don’t have a degree, but have about 6 semesters of college credits.  Ideally I’d like a full time job but my resume is really specific.  I’m not sure the best way to go about wording it and I don’t want to sell myself as a general project manager when my projects were purely Aloha based.  

The rest of my experience is in the Restaurant industry as fine dining server, Bartender.  It was the first thing I turned back to when I needed work.  I was lucky they had a place for me considering I couldn’t hear a damn thing.  Now that I can, I’m more confident, etc.

I’ve tried working with Vocational rehab but have gotten no where with them.  I think they’re understaffed so my counselor is serving a very large deaf community in the coastal Virginia area.

599,avcc64,False,Qualifications,13,"Working in IT without university degree. Expectations, Pay and Self-Doubt.",jobs,"I'm 28 years old, live in east Germany and work as a software developer since 2012.

Before I started working, I was studying Information Technology, but I aborted my university degree due to self-doubt, laziness, lack of knowledge and my former mindset of never asking for any help at all.

I only barely got my high school diploma too, because I was always stubborn and refused to do anything for school at all, but I was intelligent enough to kind of struggle my way through it anyway with minimal effort and, needless to say, with bad grades.

&#x200B;

Today, I’m living in a city with a fairly small IT sector at around 500k inhabitants.

My current company is fairly liberal when it comes to hierarchy and the need for any degrees. Our CEO always claims to pay people according to their actual performance, quality of work, etc.

That said, every employee in our company still only gets paid fairly poor, based on talk with colleagues and the manager for HR.

&#x200B;

After struggling through school and aborting University, and earning relatively little money compared to my friends (who all graduated, but in different jobs, not IT), I now feel like I’m falling behind. Some of those friends started working after graduating and they (of course) earn way more money, some even up to 1.000€ per month more than what I get paid.

Still, I don’t want to invest another 5 years of going back to university, earning next to no money and in the end maybe not even be intelligent enough to graduate this time. I lack skills even for basic high school maths, and It has been 10 years since I actually had to study.

&#x200B;

In addition, in the past 4 years our company grew and we hired a lot of new developers, and to be honest, I often don’t feel like the ones with a university degree are naturally better than I am.

From my personal experience with my new colleagues I can tell, that not the degree determines how good one is as a developer, but just work experience, ambition and having a knack for logic, abstraction etc.

I talked about this with my CEO, and he was very understanding of my situation. Still, he claims that a University degree won’t help me in the end, because I basically just invest 5 more years into an education that will give me only a better understanding of general mathematics, computer science and of course the diploma/masters degree, but won’t necessarily make me a better developer in the end.

&#x200B;

I’m torn, between my need for validation by earning a university degree, or by earning way more money, so I can get validation from my bank account, and the voice in the back of my head that tells me „The value of a human being is not determined by a degree or money. Don’t put so much stress on yourself, you earn enough money to live comfortable“.

You have also noticed one of things most people notice about higher education graduates, they barely know a thing about doing their job, it's virtually worthless as an indicator of how well they will be as a software developer, the only thing it actually tells you is they were willing to put in the time it take to get the degree.

The only thing a degree will really do for you is open up a few job opportunities, some companies are really hung up on only hiring people with a degree. But currently in our field there are plenty of place you can hop around to, if you just want a raise. With 7 years experience you could (probably, I'm not really familiar with the german job market.) easily find a higher paid job without wasting time and money on a degree.

I was led to believe that I would be working with customers to design CNC machines that fit their requirements. In actuality I was hired to be a travelling service mechanic. Every review for 3 years I told my boss I wanted an engineering job, and he always told me I needed to learn the how's and why's before I could design them. Meanwhile I realized that was all bullshit because my company hired fresh graduates to do those jobs anyways.  
  
Two years ago my boss was promoted and my new boss started cracking whips. Made my life a living hell and has me on the road 50-60% of the year while other techs get to stay home quite often, and most of it is no-notice. I started looking for new jobs but we're in a very rural location with little engineering jobs available.

I was an IT Manager for about 4 years with years of IT experience in my background. I know in many places there have been hiring freezes and whatnot so I haven't personally began to look for new jobs knowing that right now they're seemingly non-existent.  I was laid off late March/early April and I've just enjoyed the stress-free time for the most part.

Right now on unemployment though I'm making a pretty penny while being able to take care of my daughter (we were paying about $210/week so not only am I able to be a father during these times but the money saved for not having her in daycare has amounted to a massive amount of savings -- not to mention that's one less point of exposure).

I know eventually my unemployment funds will run out, but as it currently stands that's going to be months away. I planned on using this time to get some IT certs while this all blows over but I also feel like if I stay without a job for too long it's going to be detrimental.

I'm not going to lie, the amount of reduced stress as been amazing for my health, but I also feel like back in the older days where if I wait too long I'll have a gap in my employment that could hurt me more than anything (however, given the current circumstances in the world, I feel like I have a valid excuse for not immediately looking for work).

A few added details:

* I'm not hurting for money at the moment, got about a $12k nest egg with unemployment benefits coming in
* LinkedIn all updated with recommendations and references
* I definitely wouldn't mind investing in myself, going as far as to even starting my own little small business but for now thinking of IT certifications
* With unemployment I'm making about 20% less than what I was bringing in with my previous job but factoring in things like not having to pay daycare and a few loan deferments I'm actually breaking even until the funds run out.

604,hd1ztw,False,Unemployment,9,Crossed the grim '250+ applications with no Job' mark today. Seeking exterior perspective.,jobs,"Hello all, I write this post for an exterior perspective. I have clouded my mind over the course of 1 year of applying for jobs. I can't seem to gather inspiration to apply anymore. 

I graduated in 2019 (Batchelors in ME), and I joined a Startup, but due to the depressive environment in the company ( very bad management ) I quit within a month of tourment. 

I believe I am a good engineer, I know my fundamentals and I am good with Analysis. I thought it would be relatively easy to get a job. And now, an year in, having given 6 interviews with 250+ applications, I find myself to be unemplyed. Of the 6 interviews, 1 rejected me and the others just did'nt work out due to multiple reasons including Covid19. 

In my most recent application which literally took 1 month, they lead me on with a project (which took me 1.5 weeks to complete), and loved the report I submitted. They thought it was ""great work"" and that I seem to be a good fit for their company. About a month ago, they suddenly stopped contacting me without any reason and don't respond to my emails or calls. It really hurt me because I had done 3 interviews with them and really looked forward to working there. 

Reluctantly, I find myself back to square one, sending out emails and applying through various sites. 

I still persue engineering with small projects, simulations and refresh my memory with the basics. It is a part of me, but it hurts not being able to apply my knowledge. I live with my parents, which makes things even worse, I want to be financially indipendent. 

There are companies I can work in (who would hire anyone instantly), with minial work on CAD and a low pay. I am hoping I don't have to resort to that.

At first, I really liked this job because my team in digital marketing was really great and fun and I got to learn a lot. But one problem is that our management (CEO, VPS etc) are super disorganized. Like has no clear vision of what they want, gives super vague instructions and indecisive on the output, gives us tasks without any working materials or assets and gets mad when the results aren't skyrocketing. The DM team itself is also fairly new (around a year).

Before, I could bear it cus I liked our team lead and the process but since the pandemic hit, they've pretty much wave after wave of lay offs because we weren't showing results/cost cutting (we work with international students so that's important to know).  I was spared because: 1. I was the only writer they had at the time for both operations and marketing, 2. the only one who didnt quit, 3. the only one who could work in a fast-paced environment. 

Right now though, I'm starting to really hate it here. Management is still super disorganized and has no direction, the new marketing head doesnt communicate anything and just tells me to do this and that so I have no idea what the direction of our marketing is supposed to go, work hours are spilling over to my free time, and the new 'senior writer and communications specialist' they hired is super rude and mean. Like he just barks orders and tells me to do the stuff he was assigned to do (like simply telling the devs or designers to make this web page etc). 

I was gonna suck it up until the end of the virus at least but something our new video editor said struck me. He said he wondered why they needed a new guy who doesnt know the brand of the company or know where to get the materials be the lead coordinator/project manager when the end result is that people turn to me to ask for those stuff anyway. And why they couldnt have just promoted me to senior and hired someone in my place. And like I dont wanna brag but I've been doing really good and have become familiar with all these things so I was thinking maybe he has a point.

Given the current situation there will be a lot of uncertainty and delays/hesitations from companies. So the best you can do is to be visible to your recruiters so they dont forget about you. Other people will be waiting silently so its the best time to make yourself visable. Remain hopeful and all the best. ,2020-05-12 12:35:06

I got asked if I needed her to take back some of the work since I was doing more than my fair share but that just made things worse for me. I wasn't really fighting back in terms of sharing with our supervisor all the things this other person did wrong. It seemed petty at the time. But then I tried applying for unemployment because it's not fair I was essentially bullied into quitting and my supervisor told unemployment I quit over a ""personality difference"" and  they denied my claim.

630,hb4sha,False,Unemployment,1,Thankful for the chopping block?,jobs,"(Just giving general background first. **Asking for advice through the bold lettering in the post**. ANY words of wisdom would be very appreciated :) )

My boss pulled me into a meeting today to tell me that my numbers as a salesman aren't quite making the cut. Our company is currently losing money due to Covid and they need to cut some fat on under performers. I started my sales position in February. Definitely a less than optimal time to be calling on cold accounts, lol. When he gave me the news there were a lot of different emotions going through my head: embarrassment, sadness for lost relationships, but most of all relief. I've known since the week I started that cold selling wasn't for me. I love people and connecting with them and sharing similar interests, but the idea of calling someone's personal cell phone during a pandemic and asking them to make a huge and expensive commitment to our services caused intense anxiety every day.

Sales just wasn't for me, and that's okay. I'm 22 and this is my first career out of school. The original purpose of the job was to move to another state (mission accomplished!) and I'll always be thankful for the opportunity, professional development, and relationships that have been created along the way.

**My problem lies in finding a new position. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do/what I'm qualified for.**

I got my degree in Communication Studies because everyone told me I was good at talking to people and so my dumb 18 year old brain translated that into the wisest degree path. 120 credits on communication theory and a years worth of professional recruiting/sales experience later I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs wondering what job I would possibly enjoy/be qualified for. I've heard the term ""you just have to see what jobs are out there"" a million times from friends and loved ones. I go looking and don't see anything that appeals to me. Something that my previous company emphasized was finding the ""why"" in what you do. I love the idea, but it's something that I've struggled finding the answer to for my entire life. I always fly by the seat of my pants and do things because they feel good in the moment. I have never sat down and said ""I want to be a \*insert occupation\* because I want to \*insert personal value\*."" Just isn't how my brain operates. I just don't want to end up in a position where I find another job I don't care about and repeat this process.

**I am a recent college graduate with a BA in Communication. I am very extroverted and huge on interpersonal relationship development. My work experience has persisted of Human Resources Training, Recruiting, Sales, and Entertainment jobs. I have no idea what I want to do or why I want to do the things I choose to.

Need advice.",jobs,"I would receive a gross $20,815 over 8 weeks (plus 8 weeks of health benefits), and my PTO payout of approximately $6,500 (this would be paid out either) if I took the voluntary incentive program. Last day would be June 30th. I have attempted to negotiate but since the program is a flat offer for each person by seniority (0-3 years, 4-6 years etc.), they can't negotiate because it would leave them open to questions from those they didn't allow to negotiate (it's a law firm so I'm sure they have legal reasons for this).

If I did get laid off instead, the severence would instead be 3-4 weeks (one month medical) and I am not sure they'd negotiate this either. I have pretty good arguments having led a successful project that impacted each partners' bottom line this year (I am not exaggerating that I was integral and it was extremely important, and I came up with the solutions). They would want me to sign a severance agreement for the Voluntary Program. Unsure if I got laid off if they would want me to sign something or not.

4 weeks would be about $8,000 instead of the $20,815. Unemployment over the max 26 weeks would only pay $13,000-ish in my state and I'd have to deal with re-certifying and waiting.

I’ve been living with my parents and job searching since around October. I’ve applied for about 200 jobs, done about 20 phone screens, probably 8-9 full interviews, and just received my second offer. I rejected my first offer at the beginning of February because the salary was so low I wouldn’t be able to support myself, had no benefits, and would expect 60-70 hours of work for me weekly with no paid overtime. 

This next offer is a little better. The personnel were incredibly friendly and warm (it was nice to be treated like a human) and even negotiated me a slightly higher salary without me even asking. However, that salary is still only $35K a year and the benefits are very mediocre. Furthermore, the position is far more niche than I was initially expecting, and wouldn’t give me any of the transferrable skills I’m actually looking for for the career I’m trying to pursue (it’s pure developmental writing for social work education curriculum, where I’m actually looking for a job in copy editing or copywriting in a business setting. My entire background is already in academic writing and I don’t want to pursue a career in it). The small city it’s in also doesn’t really have much of a market for what I’m looking for career-wise, and it’s not a desirable place to live or one I’d want to stay in. 

The city this job is in is several states away, and the job offers no relocation assistance. 

Is there any kind of justification for not taking this? I’m not starving or homeless, though I do have a somewhat strained relationship with my family. I feel as someone unemployed I should take this offer with no hesitation, but I can’t help but hesitate, as it seems like a dead-end job in a field I don’t want to be in, in a location I don’t want to be in that’s hours and hours away from where I live currently.

I was a MBA graduate, with an undergraduate background in marketing. Because of some screwups (both my fault and office politics), I am currently unemployed for 4 years. I had a background in marketing research and advertising, but I did dabbled as a local freelance cinematographer/video editor (because that is my 2nd main passion and I loved it more than a corporate life, but it failed again).

1. What is the current creative/media industry atmosphere in Los Angeles/the rest of the States/Australia/New Zealand now?
2. How can I get a job if I am unemployed for 4 years? Would companies care?

656,fc7l6i,False,Unemployment,9,"(23m) Communication graduate, four years unemployed.",jobs,"Get all the jokes out of the way early, I know my degree means fluff.

Now to specifics. I'm in my fourth year of no full-time work. Over the years I have honed my applications, resume and interview tactics to a fine art - the problem is, everything comes up green except the actual job. It started with a marketing position at the head office of the company I currently work for (casual). After taking me under their wing, the state manager pretty much guaranteed me the job (""apply for this and you'll get it""), and then right through the interview process was ""your resume is outstanding"".

I didn't get the job.

So I didn't give up. I kept applying through tonnes of rejections, until I conveniently found another job at my current company. Again made it right through to second place, being told everything was perfect, even when I asked for feedback.

I didn't get the job.

I then found a startup company, who loved me. They even said they went out of their way for a second interview because I was exactly the candidate they were looking for. They excitedly told me they'd be in touch until I received a phone call in a regretful tone from the hiring manager.

I didn't get the job.

I turned to free internships and free labour as a means of getting my foot in the door. The companies used my ideas I pitched to them and gave other individuals the actual internship (this one especially stung as my ideas were splashed all over their websites).

Today I just scored a second interview with a new job, and was praised for my ""entrepreneur attitude"". The problem is I'm worried history is just going to repeat itself a fourth time. I get it, that's the job life, but four years unemployed is not normal for even my unluckiest of friends.

**The Problem**

I feel like it's a literal impossibility to me to get a full time job now. Over the past four months I've submitted easily 80+ applications and tonnes of internship enquiries. Either they are ignored, rejected or lead nowhere. I can't even find opportunities to gain experience as they're either targeted at uni students or any mentioned as any demographic but me (white, straight male which has disqualified me from several internship opportunities).

I can't afford to go back and study as I can't even pay off my current uni degree loans. Worst of all my casual job has started removing shifts so I may as well be unemployed now. What do I do? Where do I look and how do I keep up hope?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fc7l6i/23m_communication_graduate_four_years_unemployed/,13,"First of all: I'm sorry to read that you've had such bad luck on the job hunt. I know that is really disheartening, because I went through the same thing 5 years ago. I didn't really know how the game worked, back then. But I do now.

So the good news is that there is a lot you can do to improve your chances!

You mentioned that you've applied to 80+ opportunities. This tells me that you're using some standardized process for your applications. You're basically submitting the same resume and a slightly altered cover letter in each, right?

Thing is: if you submit standardized job applications, you're likely to get standardized rejection emails.

As any good communicator knows, you need to tailor your message to your audience.

So the trick is **pick way fewer opportunities** and go all in on those.

So go find a company you would really love to work for and do your research. What do they do, exactly, and how could you, bringing your skills, add value to this company?

I'm sure you can think of something, since you mentioned that you pitched ideas to the companies and that they even ended up using them! I'm sure that really stings. But the harsh reality here is that your ideas were good, but the company just didn't trust you to execute on them.

And that's a problem.

Because, as any startup investor will tell you: ideas are cheap. In the end, it's all about the execution. An investor will sooner invest in a great team with a mediocre idea, than in a questionable team with a great idea.

So you need to make sure the company believes you can execute.

Solution:

**Turn a 'we should' into an 'I did'****.**

For example, instead of saying that the company could improve its copy on the landing page to tailor it more to audience XYZ (cheap idea), go ahead and actually rewrite that copy and submit it with your application!

Another example: instead of saying that the company could improve its marketing by increasing its presence on social media, go ahead and actually create a week's worth of social media content for them!

Not only will this allow you to show off your skills, but it will prove that you can do the job before you even have it!

There is no better signal you can give a potential employer.

Finally: **show genuine excitement** for the job in your application.

A standard cover letter is a terrible medium to express excitement. It's frankly plain dull, impersonal and boring.

Remember that you're marketing yourself!

Would you ever choose a ""dear sir/madam"" letter to market anything else?

Probably not.

Making a video cover letter (like with [crash.co](https://crash.co)) will really help you to express your genuine enthusiasm, as well as your communication skills and willingness to go the extra mile.

Then right after graduation ended working a year and a half in Finance (entry level job, entirely different area than my degree - just how things turned out to be). 

Decided to leave last December - no career progression, support, lots of stress in the last few months and I just decided to leave without finding a substitution (had managed to save some money for the next few months ahead, for cases like this). I was quite a good employee, everyone was happy with my work, but I wasn't feeling too good internally.

Since then, I’ve re-entered graduate school in a field I was more interested in.  I did so because I had been struggling with finding a permanent, full-time position with my experience since April, and I figured I could transition to a career I really wanted.

I’m currently in my second semester. I have had atrocious luck finding work, because retail managers know based on my resume that the work is temporary for me, but appropriate positions (temp and full-time) haven’t been pulling through.

Fast forward to this Thursday. I’ve been working with a recruiter, and she’s been extremely helpful (rare, I know). I interviewed at a place that was the best fit I’ve ever had, based on their culture, location, compensation, and growth opportunities.

The first person I spoke to, my would-be manager, loved me. The second person also seemed to really like me, but he asked me what I’ve been doing since July. I told him I was in graduate school. He didn’t seem to recoil at all, but Friday I heard from the recruiter that they really liked me, but they were afraid that I wasn’t looking to work “in a permanent position” because of school. I’ll have to wait until Monday to hear the results.

The thing is, I didn’t feel comfortable saying, “oh there’s a gap here because nobody wants me” eloquently. And so it feels like I’m being punished for being unemployed *and* for filling up my free time with something.

I’m going to stick to my story here. It’s the truth after all. But what else can I say to future employers? Why is a situation like mine a red flag anyway?

672,f9kl5i,False,Unemployment,5,Recently fired and don't know how to proceed.,jobs,"I am new in my career having just graduated in 2018. I was an IT project coordinator and realized I needed IT experience to properly do my job so I left my previous company in September for a new job. It was entry level desktop support and I had no experience coming in. My new employer knew this and said they would work to train me. When I arrived, there was another guy starting on my team doing the same position as me and there wasn't really enough work for both of us. He also had a lot more experience than me.

Things went really well for about two months and got along really well with the team and my managers. Thirty day review came in and everyone was happy with my work and was told that I had great customer service. On day sixty, I passed a major certification test and had my 60 day review later that day. It was not a glowing review and I was told I need to work on my attention to detail and that they wanted to do a special 77 day review (never a good sign).

On day 77, I was written up for more attention to detail issues and told that I was about to be fired. To me these issues were more related to learning an entirely new skill rather than not caring about details. I am a perfectionist by nature and while I can and do make mistakes, I do care about details. I was told that my probationary period was extended by an additional 60 days. I decide to work hard and keep the job despite the very toxic threat of firing this early on in the training process. My goal was to work for about a year and then leave the company.

During this time, I was a nervous wreck. Next two reviews go really well and I was told that the company was happy with my progress and they like where I was at. Things seemed really good again..... until out of the blue I was fired right before my probation was up. The reason was that clients did not want to work with me because of interpersonal communication skills but that was never fully elaborated upon. I signed an NDA, got two weeks of severance pay, and was escorted out of the building. 

Applied for Unemployment and that is still in review. Highly doubt that I get it because the company is now claiming I was disobedient and rude to my colleagues and managers. That doesn't really matter because I just want a job to support my wife and I. The company says they would give a me a good reference and even wrote me a positive review on linkedIn. They have down as a rehire so I can have new employers call and feel good about hiring me but now I don't trust them.

I have a manager at my last job before this who mentors me that says I should leave it off my resume. He says he will just tell whoever calls that I got laid off and I can say that I have been looking for work while on severance. Not sure this is the correct route to take but I feel like I have to leave this job off my resume. I was only there four months. I have been depressed for the last month because I gave everything I had in terms of effort to that job. I am just now puling myself together.

Please help?

**Why I was let go (background):** I've been at my job close to three years and I hated the job, I hate writing long reports and I didn't like the work I do but I kept going because I didn't know what I want to transition onto next. A lot of independent silent work and little collaboration, which I realize I loved. The company has been going through some changes and a lot of roles have been terminated (though not my department specifically I was only let go, which adds salt to the wound). The only thing that kept me going was the people that were there but a lot of people left (even my managers who voluntarily quit without anything lined up who would've vouch for me). The work load was getting excessive and quality was compromised as my performance hindered. Main things that added to me losing my job is that I missed catching a data mislabel mistake in a large report  before I sent over to the client and being late or missing meetings. I can own up that its partly my fault but I also was so tired of the place and toxic environment and working into the late evenings. The director who I had to work closely with clash with me in terms of personality and often says abusive stuff really lowering my self-esteem. My immediate manager does acknowledge that if I don't like it there I'm not sure why I'm still there.

**One of the things I struggle so much is explaining to networks and friends on my situation or even how I'll approach this in an upcoming interview, it's hard to say to employers I'm just not passionate or I'm simply overworked and tired and environment was not great. I've read online I need to own up to the situation and not blame the company when explaining why I was let go. Any advice on the narrative? Should I update on my LinkedIn now that I don't work there?** They are still paying my severance and won't be updating my record of employment until my last paycheck. **Below is an attempt on how I'll address it, please let me know if you have any better strategies or suggestions.**

**Long answer they ask why I was terminated if HR asks?**: It was not a good fit, a very high-turnover and dysfunctional work environment as the company is going through changes in a new direction. Over the course the last year I was there many people were terminated and left which shifted a projects over my capacity, which I admittedly struggled and really affected my performance. I learned that work life balance and culture is important to me though I understand there are times where certain milestones that requires extra time. I do prefer an environment where there is regular engagement and collaboration instead of silos.

\- the problem I think with this answer is people leaving and high turnover happens in a lot of companies and they may feel I'm not fit for the job. Thoughts?

Show you are willing to do what it takes to improve the business and to ensure the quality of working improves along with it.

&#x200B;

Also asking for a larger starting pay after you pussy out yourself previously, yeah wise move, if you would do that to me, I would open my smartphone, go to instagram, ask you for your name there, check out if you have a girlfriend and start cuckolding you. Did it before, don't mind me doing it again. She will break up with you same day I will fire you for basically no reason but in your files there will be reasons like you stole company property. Aside from that, the meaning is: You gave up, live with same pay as everyone else, you have no ground to be uppity about your payment for starters.

685,eyrkok,False,Unemployment,6,What can I do about my current situation?,jobs,"Hi, so i’m 19, turning 20 in a few months, but i’ve been having a really difficult time trying to get a job interview or even hired.(and I’m not homeless or have a threat with homelessness, so that isn’t an issue)

- I don’t have a highschool diploma (dropped out of highschool since age 17 due to health problems and difficulty attending daily) but I did do almost a year of college in hopes that maybe that would help(it didnt)
- I cant drive/never learned how, so I have issues with reliable transportation in that area or able to have the ability to snatch a job that requires driving
- I have month to over a year gaps in job consistency and even when I did have a job, I’d have to quit due to unreliable transportation/sudden city to city moving and also would get fired for lack of performance under high stress(so unstable with lasting jobs)

-Job areas ive applied for(retail, fast food, cafes, restaurants, shoe/book/clothing stores/shops, grocery stores, pharmaceutical based, hair places;think sallys, at malls, movies, post offices, etc)
- I live in a college area and not out in the city so most jobs are taken by either those in college or those who have a lot of stable job experiences 
- Ive sent out emails, called places back(to be told they aren’t hiring even when their stores have a hiring now poster up), re-applied to jobs(well over 30), applied both with and without resumes, etc and all of them keep telling me they found better matches or aren’t hiring


I really do need some sort of good advice here because I’ve been unemployed for a year and need just general help since I’m at a loss with knowing what I can do",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/eyrkok/what_can_i_do_about_my_current_situation/,1,"Let me preface this advice by saying that it is my sincere belief that people born after 1990 just really don't understand how powerful the internet is because you've had it your entire lives and just completely take it for granted.

Those of us over the age of 40 grew up in the Industrial Age and as such, we have modeled our Socio-Economic-Political Structure based on the Industrial Age.  Go out, get a job, punch a clock, work in a factory or company, etc etc is all ingrained in our society.  

However, we are now in the information age.  Unfortunately, the inertia of the Industrial Age is still with us and many people, like yourself, are guided by that inertia.

Don't be.

Learn how to make money using the internet.  Notice I said ""learn"".  Every day as a society we spend billions of hours on the internet doing ""Stuff"".  What you need to do is you need to find a way to provide a service for people that use the internet.  What exactly? I have no effing idea.  All I know is that the internet is a giant sandbox with billions of kids playing every day.  There is an infinite market that you have access to.    


What can you do?  Learn how to code, learn how to do Graphic Design, Learn how to do Video Editing,  Learn Social Media, learn about Bitcoin, become an expert at some ""part"" of the internet and then provide some sort of service for people who use the internet.

Maybe you help old people and/or Mom and Pop businesses develop social media profiles, maybe you figure out how to become a virtual assistant and offer your services to affluent types, maybe you build a website selling widgets, maybe you figure out ""something"" that people on the internet can use and you code an app for it....

Here is my advice.  

Watch at least 3 seasons of Shark Tank (doesn't matter which 3 seasons, just pick three), read some books on Entrepreneurship and starting your own business.  go through youtube and watch a few hundred hours worth of those annoying ""Here is how I make money using the internet"" scam videos that want you to buy their bullshit courses.  Do the above for 6 months like a machine and ""something"" inside your brain will click on how to make money on the internet.

You will start by working like a dog and making peanuts, in fact, your internet hourly  wage will probably start off around 5 cents an hour, that is, you work for 20 hours trying to get clients, sell widgets, etc and out of that 20 hours someone pays you $10 for a widget.  You work the next 20 hours and make $25 which comes out to 12.5 cents an hour.  You work the next 20 hours and make $50, then the next and make $100, then the next and make $150, then the next and make $400....   By the end of the year, you've figured some stuff out and now are making more than minumum wage on the internet.  By the end of the next year, you have learned even more and are now making $20/hr... by the end of the next year you are making $100/hr....

You have to learn to hunt and gather for yourself.  We are in the information age, stop trying to live by the old rules and paradigm of the Industrial age.  Educate yourself with the internet.  Yes, it will be tough, yes, it will take a lot of hard work, yes you will have to actually study and read and write shit down and learn how to code and use programs from scratch...  but long term, this is your best path.  It is not easy, it will take you a couple of years, but man, longterm it will be worth it.

Another thing that can help is to partner with someone who is in a similar boat as you are in.  You guys decide to form H&F Online Consultants.  H&F stands for Hustle and Flow.  I don't mean hustle in the bad sense, I mean hustle in the Entrepreneurial sense.  You guys help each other learn, motivate each other, spend every day looking at the internet thinking ""how can we scrape some cheddar off of the mountain of cheese in front of us...""  

You grind everyday with the mentality that you are gonna make money doing ""something"".  You are going to find a need, a niche, an edge that you can exploit.  

that is my advice.  We are in the information age.  The era of working for others hoping they dole out a salary for you is yesterday's model.  Sure, it will work for most but it is no longer ideal.  There is a sea of money out there on the internet right now, you only need a tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction to thrive.  Figure out how to get that fraction, learn to carve your own niche.

686,e0398w,False,Unemployment,34,I need urgent help just got fired from my first job out of college.,jobs,"I graduated in mechanical engineering. I got hired for an entry level position as a project engineer at a company. I worked there for 4 weeks and I was never assigned one task besides a research project from a different department manager (design engineer manager). My project engineering manager from the first day only had me learn the company and that’s exactly what I did. I read all their books about their field of work and I gained a tremendous amount of information learning their business (plastics). However out of the blue today I got fired. I asked what for and HR and my manager simply said it was a business decision that we felt like you weren’t qualified enough or had a technical understanding that we would expect from an engineer. My manager only ever once mocked my engineering education because I didn’t know what a Socket shoulder cap screw, when he was showing me machine parts. 

The department I was working under sales department were all filled with boomers. All the employees including my manager with 50+ and most of them did not have degree’s just apprenticeships and got into the trade. I worked with 2 other young coworkers who had mechanical engineering degrees. One of Em was there since he interned and the other just decided a few days ago to quit to move onto another job. So the department I was working at is now 5/7 people in their office.

I’m so confused. What do I do? How will I find another job? Won’t other companies see that I got fired when doing a background check? I’m at a complete lost of words. I need to support myself and my parents and payback my student loans. I had other offers lined up and decided to take this one because it was close to home and the best decision for me.

687,f012z7,False,Unemployment,3,Current job said they will fire me if I don’t improve.,jobs,"Okay, this situation is a little complicated.

TLDR: I’m about to get fired but it seems like a pretty amicable situation and my manger even promised a good review. I could likely collect unemployment. I have interviews lined up and need time off for that but there is no way I could get time approved. Can I just call in sick or will this hurt chances of unemployment / strain the remaining relationship I have with my current job?

————

My current job said they will terminate my employment if I do not improve by February 20th. I am trying my hardest because I always try not to burn bridges, but honestly this is kind of a blessing. I genuinely hate this job, and have already been searching elsewhere for new employment. 

Even if I do improve to their standards by the 20th, they then would want me to come in office which is simply not feasible as I live too far away (I work from home currently). So no matter what this current job is pretty much out the window. I would just leave on my own, but I can’t afford to lose my job without unemployment or another job lined up.

That being said, I have secured quite a few interviews for next week - unfortunately, the interviews are during when I’m supposed to be working my current job. My current job offers no PTO at all and any approved unpaid time off must be scheduled several **months** in advance. 

My main question is: **If I have to take 2 “sick days” in a row for these interviews, will my chances of unemployment be hurt?** I’m not sure what do. I obviously want to attend the interviews no matter what since losing this job is pretty much inevitable and I need to prepare, but I also don’t want to screw up my ability to collect unemployment if the interviews don’t work out. I know if people are obnoxiously late all the time or call in sick too often it can sometimes be considered termination for cause. I have 100% attendance besides this. Is 2 days enough of a cause? The speed of my performance is the reason they are wanting to let me go, but it was nothing that would make me seem completely negligent, just “not a good fit” for the role. I finish at about 80-85% of the speed they’re expecting from me. I don’t think my performance issues count as a cause by themselves. The can fire me for any reason as this is an at-will state, I’m just talking about “causes” in terms of unemployment. 

I’m also scared of going the route of telling my boss that I have interviews lined up and need time off for that. Getting fired is pretty much a guarantee so that isn’t the concern, it’s just that her and I still have a decent connection separate from my performance and she did previously agree to write a good review and a letter of recommendation for any future endeavors. I would hate to burn that too by just bailing, could even hurt my ability to get the jobs I’m interviewing for lol. 🤦🏻‍♀️

Just because you're not working doesn't necessarily mean you have lesser chances to get hired. I don't see any logic hiring less qualified candidates simply because they're employed at the moment. In fact, those that are employed sometimes tend to demand more than companies want to offer simply because they got nothing to lose. When a company considers someone who's unemployed, they understand that you're more motivated to start under their terms simply because you need a job. I've been unemployed since last April because my position got eliminated before contract ran its course but I didn't go out searching for a position immediately because I decided to use this time to finish my Master's degree, so I took my time and got it done and graduated in October. Now when I go to interviews and explain the gap, there are no more questions, in fact some even admitted that taking the time to finish school was a good decision.

690,er29od,False,Unemployment,8,Boss threatening to fire me over things outside my control,jobs,"Hello, I am from Australia and I work as a crew member for a fast food restaurant. I have been working here for around half a year now, and I feel like I am an excellent employee. I greet customers/take orders with a friendly demeanor, I prepare food and orders immediately, I am never late to work, I am fast paced etc. I can't see any issues with my performance.


So my issue is my manager/boss has given me a 'last chance' warning for something completely out of my control. When taking orders from customers, the order appears on screens throughout the building regardless if the order has been completed or confirmed. I presume this is to save time so the food can be made whilst the customer is ordering. The problem occurs when a customer changes their mind before the order is paid for. 

For example:

1. Customer orders a meal with a chocolate milkshake. 

2. I enter the order onto the machine, and then tell them the price.

3. The customer then goes 'oh actually can I get that with a vanilla milkshake instead?'

4. I adjust the order and then they pay.


Since I started working here, I have seen this happen multiple times per day without fail. Only over the last few days has my manager come up to me and started blaming me for the order changing. She basically said to me 'the next time it happens, you will be fired'.


I am honestly scared to go to my next shift because I feel like I can be fired at any moment for something out of my control. I would say that she is looking for an excuse to fire me, but it could also be that she just reacting badly to food wastage. I don't know. Either way, is this a valid (although dodgy) way to get rid of me as an employee? Or do I have a case of unfair dismissal if I was to be terminated? Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/er29od/boss_threatening_to_fire_me_over_things_outside/,1,"Has she actually provided a valid way to avoid this happening?  For example, 'Oh, make sure you wait to click this button until they pay.'  If there is a way to fix the problem, then you need to apply it.  I doubt that is the case, but wanted to check.

If she hasn't trained you on this, then ask her directly for how this situation is supposed to be handled.  If she starts yelling at you about the waste, just keep politely asking her how you are supposed to enter the order and collect money without entering the order?

If there is no solution, and she is just lashing out at you, yeah, I would start looking for a new job.  I can't say whether getting fired over this would violate the law in Australia, but I will say that it sounds like a toxic, shitty place to work.

If you really want the job, then you probably have to go over her head.  Send an email or letter to her boss, describe the situation, and ask how you are supposed to enter the order so this doesn't happen, as your manager can not or will not explain it to you.  But this is chancy.  It could backfire, and you'll be gone.  Even if it works, be prepared for that manager to hate you until the end of days. ",2020-01-19 21:04:32

Do you think it's significant?",jobs,"Browsing through any news sites you'll see on the front reports of the wonderful performance of the economy, with mentions of great job growth and low unemployment rates. Browsing through any subeditor and it's full praise. But how do you think it reflects the actual reality and economic conditions of people?

I've seen an almost endless opportunity of low end low pay jobs with high turnover (or not). But regardless it's not exactly clear how much of these jobs pay dignified living wages. An economy with low unemployment but large proportion of the jobs are low paying, and part time, doesn't signify something positive.   


The economy seems to be doing great, but hearing from the impression of people, and actually applying for jobs, the wages seem still poor - in relation to living costs and inflation. High paying career oriented jobs are highly competitive, you often have to compete with hundreds of people to land these jobs.   


I mean yes I could go join one of the new jobs added that pay 10 dollars an hour and be considered employed - but is that really meaningful? I just don't buy it. Employers are still as picky as every and the ones that struggle is because they offer awful wages, awful conditions, no benefits. Usually these are the places that struggle to retain workers and have high turnover, but they usually get away with it so they don't care.

Now I do acknowledge that I'm obviously not the most efficient person there, but is that expected after less than 2 weeks at my first job? He said I had this week to prove myself to not get fired, and I got the schedule for next week and I only have one shift, and now I'm afraid he's gonna have me work that last shift before dropping me, honestly idk what kind of answers I'm looking for, perhaps I'm just looking for answers from others if you guys think this is justified. Maybe at this point I should be much better? I'm a lot better than my first day that's for sure, but another kicker, we got 2 new guys, hired around the same time, one of them has quite a bit of work experience and picked it up real fast, so kudos to him, but this other new guy, he's way slower than me!!! Last shift I had with him, he did everything at what seemed like half my speed, yet he's getting way more hours.

Now one thing to mention, if this might have an effect, I'm the only minor there, everyone else is graduated, going to college, or trying to develop some other career, and most people they have working 6-8 hour shifts, maybe I just don't fit in well with his wanted schedule

I want to talk about how toxic people are around you EVEN if you have savings and supporting yourself somewhat.

- i saw jobs on indeed, did you apply to them. (as if finding job postings was a problem, did i not tell you i've been applying to 20 - 30 jobs a day) 

- go pick up garbage on street if you really can't find a job - family

- man you are not serious about the job - friend (whom i have talked to only 3 times in a year)

- all you have to do is take you resume and walk into any of those store. - neighbor (i did it didn't work, all said apply online) 

- you just dont wanna work (in one year i have had 20 interviews and applied to ~500 jobs no but that must be it) 

- im worried about your future why dont you try (wow... no words)

also i noticed people think it's ok to make you butt of a joke in every joke. i didn't know this was normal. personally job or no job i never looked at person like that. i always started conversations with what do you like vs as what i get now as i grow older it's always what do you do.

i also noticed people think it's ok to belittle you if you ever decide to have fun. going for a walk - yea just walk all day. play a game - grown unemployed men playing kids games. watching a documentary - what episode is this, 100?, did you get any interview today.
try to learn a skill - forget that just apply to jobs.

in short everyone close to you treats you progressively worse over time and your existence serves to only take garbage from all. from parents, to siblings, to friends, to neighbors, and even your barber.

I can’t even get a retail job because I’m terrible at interviews. Most recently, I interviewed at and got rejected from a charity thrift store where I already had some prior/ongoing connections through the charity with volunteer work, so that one really stung :/

I want something I can start working on *now* where I don’t have to pass what feels like an impossibly high barrier of the application and interview process. I keep hearing “if you are physically capable of typing at a computer you can work,” so where do I actually find those jobs?? I’m tired of being considered lazy and want to be doing something, just about anything.

Info that may or may not be relevant: I’m lightly on the autism spectrum. I think this contributes to me doing badly in interviews because I can come off as cold or unenthusiastic when I’m really just scared out of my brains. I am pretty functional in most other areas of my life and have learned to adapt to a lot of scenarios socially, but I think job interviews are one particular area where my weakness and anxiety in social interactions starts showing through.

I also have some “side hustles,” which are editing event photos and tutoring classmates at my college. I was able to get into both of these side jobs because there was no formal application interview process, just someone who happened to have a need that I heard about and was qualified to help with. When I reached out and introduced myself, I felt a lot more relaxed and was able to click with their personalities well. I was able to make much better first impressions because I felt more confident and wasn’t afraid of rejection. I was the first choice just for being the first to reach out and they would only look for someone else if something had happened to not work out between us. Because they had given me that first chance though and because there wasn’t someone “better” to compete with, I was able to prove myself through my work quality and ethic.

The problem with the above is that the work just isn’t consistent enough to create a dependable income. My main photo client reaches out to me when they need me to edit large shoots every few months, and tutoring is on hold until at least early next month due to summer break for our course. I also take up other freelance work/odd jobs when I can, but of course those aren’t consistent either.

Now, here's my weird situation: I was still employed when I began the interview process for the job I'm trying to get, but when I came into work today I was pulled into the office and notified that I was being terminated from my position due to inconsistent performance and being a bad fit for the company. Admittedly, I'm pretty sure my job found out that I was applying and interviewing with other jobs as well.

(I was even told I ""wasn't allowed"" to have help at one point) Last week I started discussing the possibility of hospitalization or partial hospitalization due to work/job stress putting me in a really terrible state. (I walked out and went to the ER a week ago because of the toxic coworker)

I was already planning to resign and move back across the country, but was trying to hold on until I had a job lined up. Unfortunately, I have no job offers yet, but I'm leaving a month earlier than planned and hoping it'll work in my favor, should employers start calling.

I made the decision to leave my current industry, as it's made me something of a ""bad job magnet"" - literally every job I've had after graduating has been so toxic that I usually don't even last an entire year. I'm terrified because after working in so many abusive situations, I don't trust anyone in any given office.

722,e6hea9,False,Unemployment,6,I don't know how to move on from my unemployment,jobs,"I recently graduated from a Psychology undergrad in July and was so excited and motivated to get into the job world. I quickly got a job as a Support Worker and my initial plan was to have this job for maybe a year in order to gain experience working with people with mental health experiences. A week in this changed to 6 months and then I quit 5 months later (it was less than 5 months but lets pretend its 5). 

So that was a month ago and, I don't know what I'm doing. It sounds silly but I feel almost...too scared to go back to work? I would go into work with so much anxiety because of my coworkers and now I'm scared because I fear that'll happen again. Not only do I not know what I want to do now, I definitely don't want another Healthcare Worker role, but I just don't want to get another job. 

I've applied here and there to places because I know I \*NEED\* a job but I think I'm so scared of being stuck in a place where I'm getting constant anxiety attacks that I'm not really trying.

Find a job,  stick with it for a while and master it.  Then you can look inside your company for other opportunities you'd like to try.  That's what I did with my last role.  You may get some side work, but this will make sure that: 1. you are still getting paid, 2. you are getting fulfillment from your work and 3. you can get more exposure to other aspects/ areas you may or may not be interested in.  The only downside from this side work may be they don't pay you for it,  but it gives you an opportunity to build your resumé for other opportunities inside the company or out.  It also looks good to stay with a job longer so you don't look flighty.  

As for confidence in the interviews- fake it until you make it.  Reach out to anyone and everyone to practice interviewing skills.  The more you practice, the more comfortable you feel.  I'm really good at it if you want to message me.  I'd be happy to help. ",2019-12-05 13:47:10

Today I was officially let go due to unsatisfactory performance.

Remember that scene from *The Office* where Jan gets fired and is stuck between trying to be elated, and unstoppable hysteria? I don't know if that's how I'm feeling right now. Because I *hated* my office job. It was soul-sucking and killing me. Every day I tried to think of positives but as soon as I stepped foot in that building it was like waves of despair and grief breaking down on my neck.

So now without my job I feel free, cliche but like the entire world is my oyster. I have time to do whatever I want. I can get a part-time job and write on the side. I can eat when I want. I can go for runs, I can sit outside on my balcony with a cup of coffee and watch the sunrise! I can take free online courses to better my skillset.

And so I need advice again. Everything right now is incredibly loud and I can' seem to organize my thoughts on what to do. I planned on taking today to just kind of settle down and accept this reality; clean my apartment, prepare lunches for my boyfriend, decide what of my office crap to keep.

Those of you who have been in this position before, what did you do first? What was most important?

Here's some info:

* I currently have about $5,000 in savings. I unfortunately do not receive severance under these circumstances but I get one last $1,000ish paycheck and a cash out of my vacation time which might equal another $1,000ish. My debts are about $1,000 per month.

* I plan on filing for unemployment asap.

* I have a wonderful boyfriend with a stable job, of whom I already owe a substantial amount of money. I don't want to rely on him but I know he will be there for me.

* I think I have a money market fund so at worse I can tap into that.

* I live in a large city rife with opportunity!

I’ve been hospitalized three times in the past year due to suicide attempts and ideation. There are a few things keeping me from quitting, however: 

1. I need the health insurance. My boss is a very nice person, and I think she would consider keeping me on the health insurance plan even if I quit as long as I pay the premium. There’s no guarantee though. I meet with her on Monday to discuss my employment and if I plan to come back. I might qualify for MA, but I’m not entirely sure how that process works. I’m unmarried and don’t really have any assets, just a car and $2500 in the bank. My boyfriend and I figured as a last resort, we could get married so I can be added to his health insurance plan. He’s definitely Mr. Right for me, we would just be doing things earlier than we might have wanted to.

2. I’m worried that not having a job while searching for a new one with severely impact the hunt in a negative way. My aunt thinks that this isn’t such a big deal since unemployment is low, but I’m not convinced. I might also continue my college education (a class or two, not full time) if I drop to full time.

Employers discriminate against people who are out of work.

In addition, while you are employed, you are a ""passive candidate"" and employers think you are more valuable.  So if you quit without without another job lined up, you are at a disadvantage.

>I think she would consider keeping me on the health insurance plan even if I quit as long as I pay the premium.

So don't want to die.    And finish your therapy.   If this is a work related injury, your employer must pay for it.

Look, the US job market is horrible.  Don't do things that will cause your employability to go down.

737,byc6oq,False,Unemployment,69,Graduated college but having trouble finding a good job. Should I join the military?,jobs,"I'm a 26 year old woman in Florida, I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology exactly 1 year ago now. Before I went to University I worked for several years in cell phone sales and did alright but always wanted more for myself than to become a retail manager. I genuinely wanted to become a psychologist or a therapist but I underestimated how much school actually would cost me both financially and energetically--by the time I graduated last year, I was fully burnt out on the student life and 30k in federal student loan debt. I was eager to find a good job and start working and making money, and although I attended some job fairs at my University, I really did not see much that I really wanted to do or was qualified to do.

 Part of the reason I chose Psychology (instead of something more marketable like Health/Nursing or Technology) is because I have very, very weak math skills, but my reading/language skills are through the roof. I literally practically failed the math portions on the SAT/ACT but was in the top national percentile of the reading/writing/language portions of the tests, which is how I managed to even make it into college at all.

Since I've been graduated I have avoided going back to typical retail jobs or jobs at the mall and tried to focus on more professional roles. I tried a call center job briefly during college (awful). I served as a substitute teacher for several months before I realized I don't actually want to be a teacher (the public education system is fucked right now, seriously) and it would ultimately cost me a couple thousand to get certified as a real teacher and recieve the pay and benefits (I have no money and no credit options, and no interest in taking out more loans). 

I decided to get certified to work in insurance so I studied for about a month, got a 4-40 license, and worked for a few State Farm agents. I can't even explain how ridiculous my experience with SF agents has been, the most weird employment where the businesses are failing or only a few years old yet the agents are only in the office a couple hours out of the day or don't come to work at all, yet are upset wondering why they are at the bottom in sales in the area. Weird office politics where there's one older person basically running the office for the agent and one spanish person to handle the spanish customers but otherwise extremely high turnover in the office. One office I worked for, the agent told me she had 30 employees come and go in the last two years, but had no idea why (because she was literally only in the office one day a week). A different agent convinced me to decline a job offer with a different company so I could be the only sales person in his office (more money for me and less competition) and then fired me two weeks later (over text message) after paying me half of what we agreed on and having no reason or explanation for what I did wrong besides ""you're just not a good fit"". I even asked for constructive criticism and he refused to give any. Very confusing, infuriating and weird! 

At this point I'm just very frustrated, broke and losing hope in my job search. I always played with the idea in my mind of joining the military  to get some experience, structure, travel, benefits, etc. But if I'm being honest, I'm a hippie and I don't bleed red, white and blue like I know you probably should if you're going to serve. Still, the idea of going on an adventure and getting in better shape, meeting loads of new people, gaining new skills and hopefully making it through the four years with a GI Bill and some benefits at the end, seems like a much better deal than sitting on my computer everyday shooting off emails and applications for $10 - 12 an hour jobs, having no health insurance, and just feeling like a loser. I live with my boyfriend and my lack of stable income is killing our relationship with stress, seems like we'll probably break up soon. My mother died last year and no one else in my family really seems to care at all about me. If I die, I'm pretty sure only my grandfather would be hurt, but he is very old now and will probably pass away soon. I don't feel I have as much to lose as I have to gain.

 Should I do it or is it a bad idea?

Tl;dr: Graduated college a year ago, a good job with a good company has been difficult. My family is pretty estranged from me and my relationship is on the verge of breaking up anyway. Should I go join the military?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/byc6oq/graduated_college_but_having_trouble_finding_a/,31,"I get asked this question a lot as, not only have I written books about it, but I talk about my Navy experience to people asking me if they should join.   


For women, it's an entirely different matter.   


As far as your goals, yes: you would do very well to do the military. Four years really isn't that long of a time and if you have a degree (depending on what the degree is) you'd be able to go in as an officer with better perks, better pay, and a bit of prestige to go along with it. There's more politics involved, but I won't get into that. The reason why I'd tell anybody to get into the military is the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Imagine four years of free college and books AND getting paid the BAH rate of whatever you're in. I'm finishing off the last few semesters of mine right now and getting an additional $2500 a month to just go to school is really nice. Most schools have these programs already set up so all you do is get your COE, apply for classes, and that's it.   


My real concern is with you being a female and what happens in the dark underbelly of the military...the shit they don't talk about.   


This is going to sound like I'm bad mouthing the military, but a lot of dumb ass mother fuckers join the military. Most people have their reasons (you seem very intelligent) but the mass majority aren't. A lot of people join the military because they can't hack it in the civilian world, couldn't/wouldn't get a degree, or chose the military over jail. These are the people that you'll be working with.   


I personally know two females. I'm in contact with one but lost contact with the other a few years after I got out. Both were raped. It's a thing that doesn't really get talked about unless one of them rapes a civilian and there's massive amounts of sexism happening.   


Now, this is all context: I was in the Navy, so if you're to join the military, it has to be the Air Force. Any other branch brings you too close to shit heads that are only there because they had no other choice, and the Air Force will have waaaaaay better opportunities to take what you learn out into the civilian world and thrive.

743,e6lrxw,False,Unemployment,2,Fired after 3+ years,jobs,"TLDR:
I was fired after 3+ years of employment with no warning / write ups

I started with the company in an entry-level tasting position back in early 2016. I have worked as a sales rep for the liquor brand in an ""at will"" state for about half of my tenure. 

For the first year as a sales rep, one of the owners was my general manager / mentor. Over the following 4-6 months, his authority was shifted and I received a different manager. To be honest, when that news was shared with me and the rest of the company, I was not the only one concerned with what might be going on (restructuring). A few weeks ago, I was called into a meeting out of the blue. (Just the day before my manager made me promise to take an extra day off that week since I was holding meetings on my day off) Seriously; when she called HR in with us, I thought we were going to talk about the raise I requested back in August.

Now, please remember that I have NEVER been written up or ""talked to"" while employed by this company --I was informed of two reasons for my dismissal:

 1. A buyer/bar owner expressed concerns about my consumption on company time. The thing is: 2 months ago I started taking anti anxiety medication. After a few weeks, I realized I should cut out the boozing and keep it a drink or 2 every couple days (in my industry 6-10 drinks in 1 day isn't super odd). So in the last month and a half, I can guarantee I didn't cause a ruckus. I'm also just not that type of drunk.- when I asked which account complained or date and time, they could not tell me. 


2. I voilated a from the employee handbook, which is cause for immediate termination: I was accused of coming into our showroom intoxicated. -- I have NEVER done that... At all. The assistant manager of tastingroom couldn't believe the accusation when I asked him about it. Yet again, they could not tell me when this occured. They already had my checks but not one piece of paper work showing any sort of problematic behavior. 


My manager was very kind and was very clear that I have her support and a glowing reference. Our HR lady was crying, gave me a hug and I'm pretty sure hinted at claiming unemployment (hope I don't have to appeal). No one knew of this happening aside from the ceo, hr and my direct boss. No one I have told could believe it especially those that know me well. 

I'm still in shock but I saw no to need to fight and cry; they had their minds made up. the ink on the checks was still warm from the printer so it definitely wasn't planned.

At all. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e6lrxw/fired_after_3_years/,4,Really sorry this happened to right around the holidays.

Unfortunately in February of this year, I had a bad fall and had to get back surgery which was supposed to be routine and about a week of bedrest, but it ended up failing and my recovery time got extended for about a year. I went from being an active rock climber and dancer while employed at a decent job, to needing a cane and not being able to walk around the neighborhood. Obviously I haven't returned to work since and my savings is draining fast from medical bills and gas to drive to appointments.

Now I can walk decently well, can't lift anything but I feel more comfortable managing without a cane and my recovery process is still ongoing. I decided maybe it's time to find a job like a front desk position and panic less about my financial situation, but I found out about two weeks ago that my grandmother in Japan had a heart attack and I bought a last minute plane ticket for December to be with her. I am only planning to be there for a week but if her condition is serious, I will extend it to help her out.

I know I have a lot of things working against me like the physical limitations and having to be gone during two major holidays for my grandmother (Christmas and New Years). One friend said I can find a job now and tell the employers later so I have a secure job by January, but others have said I should wait until I get back from Japan and spend more time in physical therapy. I think I should wait, I have gone to a few interviews but they all rejected me due to my injury, so maybe focus on my grandmother and myself before rushing into it. The financial situation is really stressing me out and I applied for temporary disability with no luck so far, I made some money doing crafting projects but they're not good enough quality to open an Etsy shop for (also supplies are expensive).

Sorry for the info dump, I am just lost right now and some people in my life are labelling me as a bum when I actually am trying to find a job (I'm also a part time student). Right now the only position I can manage is a front desk receptionist or cashier, but my options are limited in this small Ohio town. Any advice is helpful, am I rushing into this or is it time to find a job?

TL;DR- Got back injury, out of work for 8 months so far, no money left to pay bills.

765,blec3k,False,Unemployment,33,unemployed 3 years after college (frustrations),jobs,"I graduated in December of 2015 with a B.S. in Architecture, and the job search just hasn't been in my favor since. In the mean time, I've been constantly volunteering my time with free labor places, and have been tirelessly trying to learn more marketable skills to put on my resume and have been searching and searching for any sort of job. Everybody I know, my colleagues and friends and now my partner, all have these fancy high-class good-paying jobs, and making good names and careers out of themselves, it seems, and I'm still living with my parents frantic, nervous, and unable to get a job STILL. I'm at my wits end right now, and I'm starting year four of unemployment and I honestly don't know what else to do right now except to just sit here and keep applying. 

I've been out of any sort of workforce for so long, I have no clue how to even break into the job market after a period of unemployment like this. I am clueless. Is there a chance to recover from a three-year gap of unemployment after graduating college? I'm not sure how much my volunteering counts, and I'm not a student anymore to qualify for these internships, but I'm actually taking some classes at a community college right now, and absolutely hate it, but I don't have much else to do right now.

Another problem is that I'm a little lost in terms of career, too, so I'm looking for anything and everything right now. I might be looking in the wrong places since all these jobs listed are for assistants, clerks, technicians... It seems there is not a fit for me anywhere, but perhaps living in a smaller city isn't working in my favor. When I do get the occasional interview, I can't help but to tense up and be really nervous. Interviews are simply not my strongest point.

Being out of the job market for so long, I have no idea where to get help (if I need it), or where to turn to. Submitting resumes to staffing services doesn't even help even though others I know have had success with those agencies. I spend my days staring at the computer hoping something will happen, and nothing really has. Creating and designing and trying to get more portfolio pieces (and doing art stuff I like to do) seems like a bit of wasted time because it doesn't seem to be productive to me in terms of job searching. I don't know what else I can do, and I don't want to settle for just a cashier job, honestly... part of me thinks that's the most I will ever do, and the other half of me thinks I deserve a good job, but I don't feel very deserving after these long years of sitting around unemployed (I know I have a shit attitude, but therapy is expensive and I don't want to do that to my budget again).

Besides the occasional temp job I have had, I've never held any sort of real and long-term job before... I've always been under the impression that I've needed some fancy office job or some sort of professional job that I've never been able to get, and that makes me frustrated because I don't want to waste my existing artistic skills, and want to design and not be holed up inside a cubicle all day... I think. I probably have a really distorted view because I lack such experience, and it's really embarrassing because I'll be thirty in a few years...

**APOLOGIES.** This has turned into a rant, but I've been having such trouble and this has really been getting to my head more and more and more and it makes me want to hide from the world and maybe give up after I spend my days job searching and crying all the time. It's really hard to keep your head up when you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. Advice is welcome, but I'll re-iterate a few of my questions:

How does one break into the job market after a large gap of unemployment?

How do you keep your spirits (and your self-esteem and confidence) up when all your efforts seem to not work?

What are some interviewing tips for someone with bad social anxiety/how do you get over the nervousness??

&#x200B;

I am 26. I have a bachelor's degree in nursing and have been working full time as an RN for 4 years in various healthcare settings. I am currently unemployed. My previous job was at a large dialysis clinic in one of the worst areas of my city. The clinic was chronically, absurdly understaffed. The patients were literally uncontrollable at times. The clinic lacked leadership and communication from management. Much of the staff just didn't care much anymore, and the ones that did were going crazy trying to pick up the slack and do their best. After just 9 months at this clinic, I developed severe depression and anxiety. I took a 1 month leave of absence and voluntarily attended a 2 week outpatient day program at a local hospital. I quit as soon as my LOA was over. I didn't give them 2 weeks notice. I fully understand the consequences of having done this. I had been actively looking for other jobs for about 3 months when I quit, but did not have a job lined up before quitting. I decided I would rather work an entry level job than continue working at that clinic because my sanity was worth more than my very nice paychecks.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 2 months, and I am finding that I am not even being considered for non-nursing jobs, most likely because I am overqualified (according to my dad). What complicates things is that I am pretty burned out with nursing altogether. At this time, I am really not interested in direct patient care. I have applied to the very few jobs in my area that don't involve patient care, such as insurance company nurse jobs, but none have worked out, even though my multiple interviews went well. I look often for these types of jobs, but they are very few and far between. I just feel I need a break from nursing for a while to regain my confidence and resiliency.

&#x200B;

When at my previous job, my boyfriend was making about half of what I made, so I paid the majority of the household bills and rent. We don't have enough income to pay our bills with just his income. My parents have gifted us a good amount of money over the past 2 months to help us, and I know they would continue to if needed. Obviously that's not what I want though. I want a full time job. I have done the math, and to pay our bills without help, I would need to make somewhere around $15/hour.  When you narrow the search down, there are really very few jobs in my area that pay close to this, are full time, are something I can physically do, and don't require a specific certification or education.

&#x200B;

I have unsuccessfully applied for about 5 overnight bakery jobs (no experience required), watch battery technician, entry level furniture refinisher, medical equipment warehouse technician, inventory lead at a local candy store, entry level dental lab technician, entry level insurance claims processor.

&#x200B;

I'm just at a loss of what to do anymore.

Should I apply to jobs I know pay too little and try to work overtime? Any suggestions for companies that will not disqualify me for being overqualified?

I’ve been applying to jobs, (without any luck) but I’ve been extremely picky just for the simple fact that I have three visible piercings on my face and they aren’t subtle (bridge, septum, vertical labret).

So I guess I have three questions:

1. Is there anyway to get around them, or should I suck it up and just take them out?

IMO, it’s best not to let your piercings and tattoos be a distraction. They can address the concerns of the piercings after you get further into the interview process, but all in all it’s about first impressions. 

Even for remote jobs, you’ll likely be expected to be on camera for meetings, but there’s no reason that your piercings should be a factor after you’re hired.

775,cuyu51,False,Unemployment,13,How to market myself 42/F,jobs,"I have 19 years of professional experience.  I've been looking for a job since February of this year. 

My last professional job was in network engineering but that was just an aspect of what I did - the bulk of the job was data driven resource allocation management.   I worked big projects (as a lead) and what I did encompassed a lot of areas - project management, data analysis, computer programming/scripting, working with databases, and doing data visualization - all of which centered around the management of network resources.   The actual job I did was very niche, and doesn't really exist outside of large internet companies.    I don't want to return to telecom because it was a very tough environment to work in as a woman.  I was thinking that these skills can be applied pretty broadly, but when I go to interviews (mostly for analytics/BI) more often than not the interviewers don't seem to understand how my skills are related to the job they have.   I think when I start talking about network resources people just check out.

Additionally, I think a large part of the problem is that I don't have all the ""flashy marketing"" terms on my resume because my work in telecom didn't involve any of the high level tools that a lot of companies use.    For example a lot of companies will use things like PowerBI for data modeling, but at my old role we just used programming and Excel for data modeling.  I used Tableau for data visualization, but basically everything else I did was through script programming.   So for example when I get a question like ""what did you use for data modeling"" the answer really is, ""we just made a model"".  Basically I have tons of experience doing things ""the hard way"" whereas companies are trying to do things ""the easier way"" by using tools.  I have experience with the process but not with the tools.  

I think it may be that I'm presenting too abstract of a picture for employers to see my value.     Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated.   I'm happy to share more details.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cuyu51/how_to_market_myself_42f/,5,Doing actual models rather than relying on tools is fairly close (overlaps with) data science.

I also have a BS in Atmospheric Science, a BA in Asian Studies, and recently got a CAPM certification.

You'd figure with three degrees from a top school and a CAPM I would have some luck, but not at all. I've applied to everything from banks to museums to universities to tech startups.

The only 2 interviews I've had were at a university and at a car rental company.

Nevertheless, I'm at over 500 applications for which I have had 2 interviews, a 0.4% interview rate. I don't know what is average, but this interview rate is so close to 0 that it's barely even worth noting.

780,co7dbg,False,Unemployment,14,I need help choosing a new career (ex-lawyer),jobs,"A little about myself.  I'm 30-35, been a licensed lawyer for 5+ years.  Short story, while that is still an option, lets just say it's off the table for now.  I've lived in East coast area my whole life.  I have that typical student loan debt that is insurmountable to the point that I hardly think about it.

I really don't know what I want to do long term, or even short term.  I feel like I've been directionless for the last 7 or so years, ever since I finished law school and passed the bar exam.  I can be very focused and determined when my heart is set on it, like I was with law school.  But it's been difficult to find the thing that is within reach that I really want, at least in the area of my work life and career.  When it comes to other areas, I am not finding it as difficult.

I think some of it is just mental blockage and attitude.  But I think it really comes down to not finding the passion in the first place, even though the passion is likely somewhere... it's hard to commit due to all the uncertainties.

I've been often told that I can do so much with a law degree that isn't legal related.

I am passionate about helping others, gaming, nutrition/exercise, philosophy, writing and reading.  I like strategy, puzzles, analysis of facts and scenarios.  I don't mind when the answer is not as clear as day, I think that's important to be flexible.  I want to care about what I do, but it doesn't have to be part of some grand machination.

A couple careers I've considered/considering:Author - more of a long term thing though, plus the returns may not be sustainable for the amount of time it takes... probably couldn't do this as a career alone starting out.

Bartender - I think I wouldn't mind tending a bar, but the biggest issue is I don't want to work night shifts... so I guess this is off the table.  Too many negative health consequences for me if I work at night.

Contracts administrator - Another job I am not exactly sure what it would entail.  But on the plus side, I remember enjoying and being proficient in contracts law in law school.  I think I still have a solid grasp on the basics of the model laws many states base their laws off of.  I have no idea how to market myself to get this kind of job though.

Policy Analyst - This one sparked my interest because it was described as being part of the political process without being the politician.  I don't know anything about this.

Private investigator - Research... helping people on an individual basis...  Not really knowledgeable about this profession.  But it seems like it would fit me.

Arbitration/mediation - I took a class in law school and enjoyed it.  Not sure how to break into this though.  But helping people come to some kind of resolution, outside of court for much cheaper, is appealing to me.

I filed about a little over two weeks ago. I got a letter in the mail saying I qualified for a certain amount based on the I formation I told them.

Sorry for the uber-""run on"" sentence.  As a result of having learned nothing much of use in my 8 years (yes it took me 8 years to get a ""2-year"" degree), I have essentially no ""hard skills"" to speak of, my ""soft skills"" are somewhat limited IMHO (but being ""my own worst critic"", I'm probably ""selling myself short"" there a bit).

I've NEVER held down a ""real"" job, unless you count the weekend summer job I had for two years in high school, so my ""real-world"" experience is essentially limited to a 1-year ""fellowship"" I did at a non-profit that taught me almost no new skills (if any).

\- Epilepsy (which is largely controlled with medication, but still something to worry about obviously)

\- An ""unspecified"" Learning Disability (it doesn't have a specific name, like"" Dyslexia, or ADD/ADHD which makes it hard to define or even get people to acknowledge.....the school's fought me on it for YEARS, which also accounts for some of my lacking in education).  I'd describe it as largely related to a lacking in having or ability to develop ""executive function(ing)"" skills.....which just as I read about them briefly to help me write this up, seems like that alone would basically ""disqualify"" me from ever being able to work.

\- SEVERE depression

\- Social anxiety

So if I were to work, I would either need to make below that ""threshold"" in money and still live off of not very much money and might as well not even work unless I'm getting other things out of the job like socializing and making friends and perhaps (although HIGHLY unlikely given what I described about my education/skill set) a job that I actually ENJOY (another ""run-on"" sentence, I apologize) ...... Otherwise, I would need to make enough money that I don't really ""*need*"" my benefits, which - let's face it - is highly unlikely at least at this point in time....maybe after years of working and getting promotions I'd make enough - if that were even possible.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I feel stuck between a ""rock and a hard place"".  I'd like to work (in theory) as I feel like a ""leech on the system"" who essentially just takes money from the government (and tax-payers/society) without giving anything back, BUT I also don't want to be stuck in some ""dead-end"" job that I hate doing and dread coming to work every day and may or may not cause me to lose my benefits and potentially result in me having less money on a regular basis than if I were to just stay unemployed and collect my benefits.

&#x200B;

But I digress as it would *seem* I'm getting a bit ""off topic"" here.  What I was really getting at was, given my situation - is it possible for me to even find a job - specifically one that would pay enough that I could support myself without my benefits, without having to go back to school and get like ""tons more "" education and developing more skills?  Because up until early this year (around Jan./Feb.) I'd been looking pretty damn hard (although if I'd had more determination, ""work ethic"" and wasn't so damn ""beaten down""/dejected and just frankly exhausted from everything I've had to deal with in life and especially mentally exhausted when it comes to searching for and applying to job after job and getting nowhere, never making it past the first interview (and interviews have been few and far between) before being rejected.

&#x200B;

And I've even tried (2) places whose job it is to help me develop new skills and ""job hunt"" and learn/develop new skills, but I've ended up giving up on both of them due to lack of success and frustration.  With the second one, we never even got around to actually applying to jobs, they just screwed around with me all the time trying to (or claiming to try to teach me new skills) but it took forever for us to make any progress even in that regard.

&#x200B;

(I'm almost finished).  I know I'm ranting now, but I feel like I've run out of options and am really weighing my options as far as whether I need to find new routes to finding a job, or if it's just not even worth it for me to try anymore and I should just learn to be content living on my ""benefits"".  Especially since I've come to the realization that I'm ""tired"" of learning and trying to develop new skills (which is kind of a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" I guess as far as failing to land a job) and either need help with having the willpower to continue with it or maybe I'm ""beyond help"" really AM the  complete and utter failure I feel like I am, and should just give up hope.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/crbdk2/am_i_unemployable/,1,"Ive seen retards bag stuff at Kroger, you could work there a couple days a week ",2019-08-16 19:40:23

798,bkxiq4,False,Unemployment,21,Unemployed and unsure of priorities 41/F,jobs,"I worked for a major telecom company for 15 years in network engineering/data engineering.   I was laid off at the end of 2017.  Due to health issues plus having severance I decided to freelance part time for a year.   In the middle of 2018 I became extremely ill due to a chronic condition I have had since birth.   Thankfully (and I am so grateful) I was able to find a new treatment and in January my family and I decided that returning to full-time employment would be the most prudent path.   

&#x200B;

My severance was spent by January 2019.   We have been living off of my husband's salary and savings.  I waited too long to apply for unemployment (has to be within a year of termination), the reason being that I was ill and couldn't work.  So we are OK for the moment but if something doesn't change we will be in a bad place.  We probably still have 6-9 months of wiggle room. 

&#x200B;

I am willing to do almost anything for work.  I have no pride issues over taking a minimum wage (or close) job.  I do have concerns over my physical health - while I am better I do not know if I could handle being on my feet for 8 hours in a work day.  

&#x200B;

Plus I have marketable skills! So many.  I can program computers.  Most of my last position at the telecom company was writing system engineering scripts for various purposes, moving data around so other platforms could pick it up and utilize it.  I have been a UNIX/Linux user for more than 20 years and have 10 years of experience working on Linux systems.  I have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in network/computer engineering.   I can do data visualization in the major BI tools (power BI/Tableau).   And more!

&#x200B;

Given my experience and skills I have been applying for jobs with databases, programming, Linux, and data visualization.  Up until two weeks ago I was getting 4-5 calls from recruiters per week.  In 3 months of searching I have had 4 phone interviews and two in person interviews.   The last in-person really looked like it was going to work out but I didn't get it.  OK that happens.  But for the last two weeks I have only gotten one call from a recruiter for a job that I wasn't remotely qualified for.  Only one application I've sent in so far has resulted in a response. So panic is definitely settling in.  

&#x200B;

I have no idea what to prioritize at this time.   Should I be looking for an ""any job"" no matter what it pays?   How much should I worry about my salary history?  If I take a ""stop-gap"" job will that interfere with my ability to find a professional level job?  How worried should I be about my health when we may not be able to pay the bills in a few months?  

&#x200B;

The real crux of this boils down to: will an ""any job"" affect my chances of getting a ""real job"" down the line?   There is so much conflicting information about this.

Example:  my dad sent me an email:

Here's a site you can use if you're ever searching for work.

(link to site with some openings that have nothing to do with my industry or for the few that do, I'm not qualified for).   His job site claims minimum hourly wages of $25-40/ hour in ""part time government jobs"", when in fact it's just an ad he fell for and is spamming me with.   I clicked his so called ""great"" ""recommended"" site and I see zero jobs openings in my field and some delivery driver part time gigs starting at $16/hr.

A: Save up while working in IT, get a medical degree in America, then move to Scotland or Canada to complete a medical residency and practice.  

B: Get a career in healthcare, either in IT or as a nurse, and work in a position in America that will pay to help me get a medical degree, deal with an American residency (I'd rather do my residency in Scotland/Canada, if possible), and move to Scotland or Canada as a fully certified doctor.

C: Move to Scotland or Canada while working in IT, proceed to get the degree, certifications/residency and practice there.

I know some medical facilities are willing to pay some education costs if you're working in an applicable field, so I know nursing would work better for that aspect, but the IT position may work out better in the long run, financially speaking as it wouldn't necessarily require much additional training and may be more sustainable for me physically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/haepxw/what_is_the_best_way_to_a_medical_career_and/,4,"Hi currently in Alberta, Canada.

Honestly I think your real problem is your expectations. If I understand your post correctly, you hope that if you get a master’s degree, you will be able to change careers. Many people (including myself) have undertaken master’s degrees with this hope. What these people fail to understand is that experience is far more important than education and that sitting in a classroom does not give you job experience. Entry-level jobs require experience and you need at least an internship in a relevant field to be considered for something. Just to use myself as an example, after getting my master’s in a new field I was not even considered for secretarial-level jobs which didn’t require a college degree. This was because I had no actual job experience in that field. I know this is quite anecdotal but if you go on r/jobs or similar forums you can see stories from masters and PhD grads who have been going for months or years without being able to land a job in their chosen field.

Compounding your problem if you want to change careers is that you plan to study in Belgium. Actually I can empathize with you since I got my master’s in a foreign country as well. But this brings with it a lot of problems. First and foremost is not being able to use the resources of the school to get employment. Are you an EU citizen? If not then campus recruitment events and the connections of your profs are pretty much useless since you are not going to be working in Europe. Then you will be stuck cold applying to jobs on LinkedIn that already have 600+ applicants. Trust me, that is not a fun place to be.

Basically, I would advise you not to get a master’s unless you know that 1. The degree is in high demand and 2. You have a plan for getting practical experience during your study. I guess with something like data science that another commentator suggested, that would look like having an internship during your study period AND coming out with strong coding skills and example projects that you could show employers. Not easy to accomplish in the typical 2-year period of a master’s degree but possible for sure. I think that a master's in educational studies makes a lot of sense for you. Since you already have five years of experience teaching, you will be well-positioned to job hunt after you get that degree. But if you are set on getting out of education, then obviously you would need to study a different major.

Just a side note since you mentioned possibly working in HR in the comments: you need HR experience. I graduated with an advanced degree in an HR-related field, publications, conference presentations, HR analytics skills with projects to demonstrate them, etc. Couldn’t even get a job as an HR clerk in positions which didn’t require a college degree. HR is heavily connected to legal compliance and most companies will look for someone who has experience with the legal / regulatory aspects of HR because it opens companies up to lawsuits if the job is done incorrectly. I think other fields would be a lot easier to break into as a new grad and I did find a job in a non-HR field. But that is just my anecdotal experience, take that with a grain of salt if you really have a passion for HR. ",2020-05-17 06:36:03
813,hbkkf1,False,Education,3,I want to go back to school and I'm not sure where to start. Any advice on which path I should take?,jobs," 

**Quick background:** I'm from Maryland and I just graduated with a *less than useful* undergraduate degree about a month ago. I honestly don't even want to say what it is... I hate the stigma of calling any degree useless, but I think it truly is useless to me with the new goals I have in mind (even *without* the current pandemic I graduated into). After hearing horror stories about my job prospects without the proper education, I want to get a head-start on bettering my situation before going through years of no job opportunity dry-spells post-graduation.

Currently, through a personal connection, I was lucky enough to get hired to do some at-home part time administrative and graphic design work for a local business. I want to take advantage of this period + the limited mobility I have due to COVID-19 to get some **online** schooling done. My ultimate goal is to break into **Human Resources.**

I can't decide if I should:

**1) Get a second bachelor's degree and pretend the first one never happened.** After doing some research, it shouldn't take another 4 whole years to earn another Bachelor's due to my accumulated credits.

**2) Go for a postgraduate degree.** I've been told that earning a second bachelors isn't the best use of time and money and that I might as well go for my Master's in a more productive field? My concern is that I'm not sure if I have the qualifications to be accepted into a Master's program in my new chosen field . My current degree isn't all that transferable to different subjects :(

**3) Go for certification programs.** This might be the quickest way to make myself a little more marketable. It might make it easier to find entry level jobs and internships I want in my new field. And I can always pursue my Master's at a later time.

**4) Go for an Associates degree.** Just another option, but I'm not sure if this will be more or less helpful than pursuing certifications.

Of course I'm still going to be applying for jobs, learning more helpful skills, and crossing my fingers on my own time (I'm also juggling trying to get my driver's license right now).

But I would appreciate any advice on what would be the best way to dedicate my overall time. I don't want to make the same mistakes again. My family is getting older, and I wish to be able to give back to them some day soon.

**TLDR;**

**I'm a recent graduate. I have a ""useless"" degree. I want to do some online schooling/training to better my prospects and break into HR. All of the schooling I'm considering will have to be** **ONLINE.** **There are various routes I'm thinking of taking. I don't know which option will be the most productive. Any advice would be much appreciated!**

(Additional Info - I managed to graduate debt free and I have quite a chunk of money in my savings. I'm not *too* worried about the cost of the online schooling because I know it'll be worth it. But if you have any affordable, *cost-effective* online-program recommendations, I would absolutely love to hear them. I am still trying to buy a car in the very near future after all, haha!)

I asked myself sometimes what I want to do for a living and well, the answer is always the same, nothing. 

I considered various careers; law, veterinary, economics, translation... But I just can't imagine doing any. All of them sound interesting but I just quickly lose interest in things.

I often find something we learn at school interesting, but after half an hour or less I lose interest, that line crossed, I start procrastinating and just can't focus.

I understand some French but dropped it (May continue later) and I'd like to pick up 2 new ones (2 out of Japanese, Chinese, and Russian).

Other than languages I am a bit curious about economics and entrepreneurship.

Same for GPA, as long as it's decent then no one will really care unless you want to stay in academia. Projects and actual work are far more important. 

The difference where prestige really matters is more on the professional network side of who you meet and what opportunities they connect you with, but again it is perhaps largely luck based and any decent uni will have some opportunities to meet good people. 

The flip side is that it can be better to be a top student at a 2nd tier school rather than middle of the pack or lower at a top tier school, not just from the competitive stress but also from the investment the professors have in you and helping you to succeed. ",2020-05-26 22:23:46
833,gwbk6c,False,Education,1,Go for master degree abroad or Continuing my career?,jobs,"Hi guys,

I am facing a decision that can change what I will do long-term. I am 24 years old, working in the compliance (back-office) department of a major international bank in Hong Kong. I have been working there for 2 years after receiving my Finance/Statistics bachelor degree. The job's salary is really good as a uni graduate, but the job itself is boring and hasn't developed my skills and knowledge anymore, given limited and rather operational job scope of the team. The tasks that my seniors are doing are quite similar to my current tasks. In terms of international mobility within banking compliance, it is only possible in English-speaking countries where large financial institutions exist. Due to the prolonged political tension in Hong Kong, the development of the city is grim and the financial industry is shrinking. I don't feel that my job is safe and I am feeling empty after working in the field for 2 years.

Meanwhile, since a year ago I have been thinking about studying a master degree in Germany, which could improve my profile. I have been interested in studying and living in Germany since a long time ago and visited the country for a few times, the longest being 2 months in Berlin studying German. Recently I have reached B2 (upper-intermediate) level in the language, so it wouldn't take a long time to be fluent in it. Recently I have received an offer from the Technical University of Munich - Master in Management and Technology starting Winter 2020 (2-year program, at least), and wonder if I should take the offer and study again from November this year. In long-term I hope to stay in Germany and work there, hopefully in Tech-related area, maybe Fintech. As most of the students graduate at the age of 25-27 in Germany with a master degree, I hope it will be fine by the time I graduate.

My question is whether I should make this move, given that the current corona crisis and I am not sure if I can stay in the country for longer term.

837,gyplv5,False,Education,0,Future career path for someone who has interests in non marketable fields,jobs,"Say you like philosophy or literature or art, how do you choose what to do in life, to make people give you their money you gotta have something to offer, so if you are an software engineer or a surgeon or a chemist there are fields where companies that work and make money need your service and are willing to pay money for it, or you can create something new to offer people and make your own business, or you can research in that field and contribute to its future, but that last part is less retributive.

Now if you're a person like I said in the beginning what do you do?
You can write or paint, that's what you're passionate about and you're happy doing that, but you also want money, you have to get creative about it, find a way, it's harder, so if you use your mind you can come up with something I think, alot of people don't bc its easier to just get a job and be passive, but I also think that you cant only rely on that, doing one of those things at university it's a death sentence for your job, you can teach but that's it, if you do something it's most probably not related to your degree bc it's not a marketable skill (unless you become like an art museum manager but that's rare and cant rely on that either).

So what do you do, the options I see are those:

-you study it anyway, you got an almost useless degree and worked a shitty unqualified job part time 3 to 5 years so you dont even have a kind of career in a field or much money, and ur in a place like the USA u also got debt. You dont make much money and its probs a dead end job so unless something special happens you're stuck.

-you dont study at uni but by yourself and start a job right away, probably a bad one bc u dont have any skills right out of ""high school"" (the name you call it actually depends on your country) and ur 17/18/19 (also depends on country). You dont make much money and its probs a dead end job so unless something special happens you're stuck.

-You get a degree in something you don't like but makes money, and then work a job in that field so you don't like it either, if you make alot maybe you'll FIRE at some point, but it's mortifying to walk that path.



So how do you go about it?
It's like you're handicapped in the job world.
Career and money it's not all that there is in life but if ur poor most likely your life sucks so.

841,gtawls,False,Education,1,18 year old - deciding a major in the U.K.,jobs,"
This whole time I've been focusing on business management/marketing as a field in university and I keep hearing things on reddit about how it is too broad. I think one of the main reasons I leaned towards this was because personally, I love talking to people, not necessarily socialising but persuading, negotiating, advertising things (in real life). I seriously think I'd be more passionate being a door to door salesmen instead of a person who sits behind his computer all day. I say this because, from the ages 10-16, I always sat in front of my computer for multiple hours a day after school, I played games, edited videos, all that. I loved it, but then after that, due to an environmental change, it forced me to be more extroverted outside of school time, it made me want to focus on becoming the best version of myself, I started lifting, properly talking, I gained confidence and stopped feeling sluggish. I know that...because during this lockdown, I've felt more sluggish than ever in the past 2 years and now I know why.

So anyway, I researched a bunch of fields and their experience, though I did not do well in school with Maths, I see that Computer Science is a highly demanded major especially for making money, though it does not appeal to me I could be willing to put in the work, as I got quite disappointed after searching up any business related degree and seeing it get bashed and people regretting doing it.

In my previous workplace (professional services in a big uni in London), we had a work experience placement for college students, and most of them hadn't decided yet what they wanted to do but they wanted to see how working in an office is like. A lot of young people (including myself a few years ago) have preconceived ideas of what it means to have a desk job or how workload is distributed between departments. I've always worked in non-profit environments (so not a lot of money-making here) but I've always had tons of interaction and opportunities for leadership. I'd recommend that you check out different industries and roles, talk to older friends, etc to get a sense of the kind of culture you'd feel comfortable in and take it from there.

Also, it's important that you study something that you actually enjoy doing because once you're in a course and you have to take exams, the motivation of ""this is going to give me a lot of money in the future"" simply won't be enough. When I was in uni, I had so many classmates that didn't like studying languages and struggled for years with their Chinese classes... What's the point of gaining a skill that you don't like using or that you don't feel confident in? So yeah, maybe you want to minimise the amount of Maths you'll be taking. ",2020-05-30 08:31:27

Hi everybody. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about my future. I’m 18F and I’ve just finished my first year at college studying business. 

The thing is, I really like art and design, and I want to do something related to it. However, I didn’t have enough confidence to enter an art or design program out of fear that I wouldn’t be able to get my foot in the door and kickstart a career out of it. The art industry is very competitive, and I felt like I couldn’t market myself or understand the business side without studying business. 

I don’t mind business; I find some parts, such as stocks, accounting, some management concepts interesting. But I don’t want to just do business my whole life.. I kind of don’t even know what it is exactly, since the field is so broad! I’m specializing in marketing since I heard that you can do advertising or maybe even design. I just want to do something with a mix of art and business. However, I don’t know what jobs are actually available that mesh those two together

I guess my general questions are: 
1. What kind of jobs are popular in the marketing industry?

I am 18 and currently attend a community college and only plan to do the needed two years to earn my Associates Degree, and not transfer to do a Bachelor's.

Is it bad to just have an Associates Degree? Can I still get into good paying jobs with two years? How much does GPA really matter with a 2 year degree?

My reasoning:

Firstly, I have extremely severe issues focusing on studies (will be getting diagnosed by a doctor in the next few weeks, I believe I have very strong ADD) This is the majority of the reason why I do not want to do two more years.

I am ***not*** saying the following to ""flex"" (so please do NOT say that in the comments thank you!!), but to give more context upon my situation.

I am not in a desperate need for money, I am fortunate enough to own two vehicles and soon my own place to live all which my parents have graciously provided me (I am very fortunate I know). They cover a majority of the needed costs + I have a delivery driving job that I make decent pay from. Possibly after a year or two of being moved in I plan to get a roommate to pay me rent so that will be an extra source of income.

Of course I want to be successful on my own, this is my reason for attending college in the first place. I try my very hardest, but end up with a C average.

I'm considering studying at a Canadian institution like BCIT in order to have better access to the local labor market (making contacts, BCIT job board, etc ). 

I would like to know if paying the price of a certificate (some 7500 CAD) from an institution like that is worth it from a job search standpoint, or if I'm just better off looking for a job in the traditional way (applying directly to companies, Zip recruiter, Linkedin, etc).

For example, here in Mexico, having access to the job boards and contacts (both faculty and students) of elite universities is a game changer when it comes to gettting a high paying job, while public job boards are basically useless and have awful job offers.

On the other hand, in Spain (where I went to university) I found university job boards to be a waste of time with usually poor job postings, and few contacts to be made (most of faculty are bureaucrats without private sector experience). In Spain you're better off applying directly to companies or using public job boards.

This is due to a lot of things; my own anxiety scaring me away from schooling, and me not fighting that anxiety being the real culprits.

Anyway, I’m throwing that out the window and calling my local technical college tomorrow. I’ve been thinking about going in to medical coding for years. Some reasons why:

-I have social anxiety and am a bit of an introvert, and this job seems like a decent fit for that

-I enjoy using computers in general; just the sound of a keyboard relaxes me a lot

-I need schooling that’s around a year or less (a little more than that is ok too)

-I need to make at least 25k-30k per year within the next 2 years, full time hours are fine for me; this career seems to make that possible

-Seems to avoid weekends, which is important for my circumstances

-I really want a job where when I go home, I don’t take it home with me. I want to do my job, then not think about it

From what I have seen, this career seems to check all those boxes, right?

If so, I really want to look into starting classes. Thing is, for 1 year of schooling, my local technical college estimates around $5000-$5500, and that’s not including books. Does that seem right? For some reason I thought I heard it would be cheaper, but maybe that’s just for 3-4 month certification?

Finally, if $5000-$5500 is accurate, I’m debating how to go about paying for it. I have a decently large chunk of money from a windfall, about $30k, but I’m worrying if I should really use $5k of that on this course. I worry that once I spend it, it obviously won’t come back, so what if this course is the completely wrong decision for me and now all I did was throw away $5k?

Here's are some input. 

Fore most, a bachelor in biology, biochem, or chemistry isnt really enough to get the good salary because your competion are those with master and doctor degree. U will most likely need to pursue a master or doctor if u want a good salary. Also a good salary vary...

As for school, it only matter if u looking foward toward a concentration or career. What do i mean by this? Most of the classes of biology are the same regardless where u go, however some schools offer concentrations other university may not. For example, in california; the univeristy in the bay have marine biology as a concentration while those in the central valley dont. Some university offer wild life biology as a concentration and some dont. Some university focus more on medicine sides of biology. Biology is so broad especially at an undergrad level.

When pursing your undergrad, talk to your professors especially the one who focus in your concentration. Get to know them and ask them how u can help on their researchs. For example, when i was taking my pre req for biology, i joined a field biology club and talk to the professor. He offer me a part time position to help with data entry regard to species phenotypes. This experience allow to understand how field biology was different than lab work.

The science u will need to know are physics, chemistry, and biology. The program will teach u and discipline u so dont worry about it for now.

If u go toward biology or any science major, i really really recommend getting a master or doctor afterward.But for me, i got what i needed and took my analaytical skills to run a business because that where my passion align.

I truly recommend majoring in biology, it's an amazing journey and u will learn so much about the natural world. If u have more question feel free to dm me. there's alot more but i cant cover it in one go. ",2020-04-03 16:20:04

I took some time off for the summer and fall to travel with family and learn some new coding languages like SQL. I started my job hunt on new year's day this year and as I expected, the search has been brutal.

All the advisors at my alma mater are pushing me towards MBA and other Master's programs but I feel that's all just a sales pitch for more of my money.

3. An associates in software/database technology at the same community college (11 courses involving oracle, SQL, java & other programming)

\#1 is the only step above my bachelors. #2 is the fastest and cheapest option. #3 would give me the biggest boost in technical skills.

A Masters or even just being a CPA candidate can impress a hiring manager even if you have little to no experience. 

Also combining accounting with MIS or data analytics is a growing market. People with these skills are rare and so are in demand. There's potential to make big bucks, allowing you to pay off student loans faster. ",2020-02-08 12:23:29

What I might recommend is to do a double major in marketing and either accounting or finance.

Hi,

as the title suggests, I'm torn between these two fields. I'm set on beginning studying this fall, and don't know which one to choose. Below are pros and cons that I see. What do you think about this? 

**Engineering/Architecture:**

This programme is a double degree, in both Engineering and Architecture. 

Pros:

* I enjoy the creative and aesthetic aspect. I am almost certain I would be a good architect. 

* I have some sort of business vision

* I enjoy maths

* I enjoy building (construction)

Cons: 

* Worried I won't feel like I'm helping humanity/individuals; that I would lack meaning. 

* I worry that I might be mislead by the apparent praise/value/prestige a double degree is given, while I only value the engineering degree (apart from my appreciation for maths) as far as a merit to retreive higher positions and pay in future jobs. Solely a degree in architecture, I reason, would not be enough to speedily propel me toward my end goal (having my own business, being self-employed). 

* no higher purpose, other than the fact that I enjoy the ideation of living spaces. 




**Physician:**

Pros:

* Actually helping individuals on a daily basis; altruism; reducing the amount of suffering in the world.

* Opportunities for research, which could have a significant impact, and would probably feel meaningful.

* Working with people, as opposed to sitting behind a computer designing houses for the middle/-upper class. 

Cons:

* Lacks the creative aspect. (Might be wrong?)

* I haven't ever really been interested in neither chemistry nor biology in school. However, one's interests change through life. It is common that what once has been deemed uninteresting, later in life is discovered to be very interesting. My stated disinterest in chemistry and biology is not to be taken as completely true, as I'm not too familiar with the subjects, other than from high school, really. 

* (Difficult education. However, I am from Sweden so it's not as bad as in the US, same goes for working conditions)

I think I need to upskill and most recently I did a TEFL before realising that I needed a CELTA or TESOL to teach IN this country. To be a teaching assistant I need CACHE.

When I was younger I hoped to follow a standard BA-> MA and maybe PhD route, but since I was ill during and after my undergraduate studies I lost my confidence in being able to do more than BA. 

I've seen some interesting research assistant roles but they pretty much all require a Masters (MRes in particular). I went on open days for the unis to learn more about the MA programs and was quite interested. I brought them up with my parents afterwards and my mum in particular wasn't really interested while Dad was ambivalent. Mum practically handled my Student Finance claims when I was an undergraduate since I wasn't very well throughout my studies (e.g. I gave her permission to speak with the call centre on my behalf); despite this I got a scholarship/bursary two years in a row and avoided accommodation by staying at home (a decision I partially regret but it's done) so paid off most of my debt back then.

First-generation college student here, and I'm lost as heck.

I started college off as a Computer Science major at UC Irvine; I applied to the major since I've always been mathematically inclined and had messed with Code Academy but I didn't really know what I wanted to do, nor had I ever taken any CS classes. It kicked my a— my 1st year of college, and I had never felt worse: I only passed the first introductory course and failed the next class. I coasted until my Junior year by taking GE classes and not focusing on any upper divs.

Fast forward, my counselor decided it was best for me to switch into Sociology if I still wanted to graduate with a different major on time. Me being me, I followed her advice since I figured she would know more than me.

Now as a senior in college, the sociology classes that I am taking are okay—they're interesting—but I don't know what type of job I could get out of college? I haven't considered graduate school for Sociology because I'm not too fond of the major.

As I stated, I love math, but after coming to college, I feel like I am not as smart as I thought I was in high school. I was thinking about switching into Business Economics since I've taken a good amount of Econ courses which I enjoyed, and I've passed all of the math classes required for the major already.

So I attend Indiana University, and here the two big majors in our School of Informatics and Computing are, obviously, Informatics and Computer Science. We don't have a super successful or established program, but we do pretty well and graduates from both majors typically end up in high-paying jobs. 

I'm currently an Informatics major, but I am thinking about switching to Computer Science. I've heard from lots of people both in the CS program and in the workforce that majoring in CS will ultimately give me more job opportunities. I feel like I'm learning more useful and tangible skills in my intro to programming class (a CS class that I'm taking for an Info credit), where we're learning Python. In contrast, what I'm learning in my Informatics classes is... relatively interesting, but not super helpful? It's pretty much just learning about how technology interacts with society, the ethics behind technology, etc. I love learning and researching these things, but truthfully while I'm here paying a bunch of money in college I'd like to learn more skills that I can take with me to the work force.

The jobs that I'm interested in mainly include software engineering/development, web development, UX/UI design, and similar jobs. Would a Computer Science degree help me in getting these jobs more than an Informatics degree would?

The specific degree is a [Bachelor of Business/Bachelor of Arts](https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/programme-course/programme.cfm?prog_id=93156) which I am studying at Massey University. My majors are Management and Economics, respectively. 

I am a dual citizen of the United States and NZ and have wanted to live in the US for a while now. I initially planned on moving after I finished high school, but decided to stay and complete my degree in NZ as tuition is so much cheaper here. I started off doing the 3-year Bachelor of Business degree, but a family member in the US told me that he thought a 3-year degree would not be marketable in the United States and said I should try to find a 4-year degree which recruiters would see as equivalent to a 4-year American Bachelor's degree. I found the conjoint program which seemed like a great option as it allowed me to attain two 3-year degrees over 4 years. 

Basically, I have two questions. Is this a marketable degree in the US? Generally speaking, would this be comparable to a 4-year Bachelor's degree in the eyes of a recruiter, or possibly even stronger? I'm not too picky about which field I work in, but I'd rather not complete another degree (i.e. an MBA) after completing this conjoint degree as I will have had enough of studying by that point. I'm not ruling out the possibility of completing an MBA or similar further down the track, but it's not something I'd like to do right now. 

My second question is; I have been studying over the summer and not taken any breaks since starting my degree as I don't want to take a long break if it's not necessary. I have already done one semester last summer and will be beginning another summer school semester in a couple of weeks. After the summer school semester, I will only have 14 classes worth of credits to take. My plan was to split classes over the next 4 semesters so I took two semesters of 4 classes and two semesters of 3 classes. I intended on studying through both main semesters of 2020 and then going on to do summer school again over summer of 2020 (end of the year for us). Then I would only have one more semester worth of classes to complete (Semester One 2020), and could theoretically have completed the two Bachelor's degrees in June 2021. I began study in February 2018. So roughly 3 and a half years. I told the same US family member about this and he advised against it, saying:

> ""You are pursuing a dual 4 year degree program so the degrees will be accepted by US employers as equivalent to a US 4 year bachelor degree.  So I think it best for you to take the full 4 years to get your 4 year degree.  Just spread it out appropriately.  Otherwise I can see confusion in the US as to whether you have an equivalent 4 year degree or you have two 3 year degrees which wouldn’t be seen as the same.  Take the full 4 years!""

Is this accurate information? It seems to me like it would be in my best interest to complete the degree as fast as I can, so long as I am motivated and able to do so. This would mean I can start looking for a job sooner and making a full-time income. I also have a long-term relationship and I plan on moving there with my GF and getting married, so completing the degree sooner would allow us to focus on this process and getting everything established in a new country. But I wouldn't want to rush the degree if it would hurt my chances of getting a job.

I am just feeling confused about a few things and would love advice from someone who better understands the system in the US and how international degrees such as mine are viewed. Thanks so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dr0so5/is_a_conjoint_bachelors_degree_bachelor_of/,2,"It sounds like you are earning a dual degree, rather than a double major.

I'd recommend you articulate this as:

   University of XYZ

   Dual degree: Bach of Arts in Economics & Bach of Business in Management

As far as how this is interpreted by employers, I wouldn't necessarily agree with your friend's interpretation.  International degrees usually have to be evaluated by companies here, which look at the country's educational system and the specific credits you took.

Otherwise, what is equally important is that you do well in school and take every opportunity to learn and gain experience that you'll be able to apply in a job.

Even then it took quite a bit of discipline on my part to do the self-study (more than I can muster these days to be honest) because...well, you don't have the validation of professor or mentor suggesting that this investment of your time and energy is worthwhile or leading somewhere.  Plus, employers still aren't sure what to make of skills developed through self-study, so the piece of paper from a reputable institution just gets your foot in the door in ways that some line items on your resume about some online courses you took can accomplish.

So, if getting into analytics is going to be full change of gears with a ground-up development of new skills and knowledge, it might be worth going for the education.  Otherwise, it's worth getting out into the working world and seeing what experiences you can drum up as an entry-level analyst, trying to grow and build your skills outside of work in parallel.

I have recently been juggling whether or not to get my MBA. Here's my situation:

I am in my early 20's graduated with my bachelors in finance about 3-4 years ago after graduating early. For the past 3-4 years I have been in and out of accounting to finance positions. Currently I work in a senior accounting position managing a department of 3 (non-staff accountants, not an accounting manager). My short-term/Medium term goal right now is to work as a senior financial analyst in a medium to large size company, or an accounting manager (upward progression). Eventually I would want to be head of corporate valuations or a controller/CFO. Would 100% like to stay corporate and non-bank, I like my work life balance.

I recently came across an opportunity to go back and get my MBA with a concentration in Finance. Not a top 10 school however AACSB accredited, and a lot cheaper. The MBA in finance would kill two birds with one stone for me, as I need 3 more classes that I can't afford to be eligible for my CPA, plus the MBA part would be great too.

Currently I have around 20k in debt from my bachelors. This is not overwhelming in any means, and very manageable. After grants, scholarships etc. I would be looking to add another 20k to my debt in order to finish the whole masters program.

I'm kind of yo-yoing back and forth as to whether or not this would be worth taking on the new debt. I realize top 10 schools would be better for job, networking all that, however it's just simply out of my means as it stands right now.

I loved the school and wanted to stay, but I also wanted to get into an engineering career. When I was discussing this with my parents, my father told me not to worry because engineering and physics are so closely related that I wouldn’t have a problem finding an engineering position post-graduation. “You will be able to tell the engineers what’s wrong with their designs,” he would say, and I blindly believed him. 

So I graduated and started looking for engineering jobs but I didn’t seem to be qualified for any entry level ones. I thought to myself, “That’s just cause you don’t have any experience. You learn these things on the job, just find something to get yourself started in the engineering world and you’ll find your way.” I eventually figured out that with my degree, I was most qualified for Test Engineering jobs. That’s got the word engineer in it, I must be on the right track! 

I got a job as a Test Engineer and quickly realized it wasn’t the type of engineering I thought it would be, but the pay wasn’t bad so I sucked it up and worked. After a few years I wanted to take on more responsibility and since there was no room for growth in this particular company, I started looking for other jobs. I thought, “I have some experience, I can get an engineering job now.” So I searched and searched and quickly realized that I am in no way qualified for an engineering position. I don’t feel like I have any actual skills. I used to be able to do math and stuff, and I took simple electronics classes in my physics coursework, but it’s been so long that I don’t remember how to do it anymore. Now I’m working in systems engineering, essentially making sure test plans and reports aren’t written at a second grade level (which many of them are) and I’m so bored. I don’t know where my career path will go, but I’m sure now that I don’t have the education to pull off an engineering job.

I don’t know why I’m posting this, to be honest. I think I just needed to get it out. Maybe I’m looking for direction too.

It also opens the door to Quality, Analytics, Performance, Operations Research, etc all of which you can make decent money and stay technical.  

WHen I went to college I will admit that ""Engineer"" was the buzz word of the day and that is what I ""thought"" I wanted to be.  But when I read all the various majors and course descriptions, it wasn't quite what I wanted.  Turns out, the closest thing to what I wanted was Physics.  So I got a physics degree with a heavy emphasis on Engineering courses that I liked.  

Post college when I was looking at various jobs, I didn't really care as long as the job was technical and dealt with technology.  With my physics background I was able to quickly pick up and learn whatever the job entailed.

So Not sure why you are knocking the Physics degree.  To be honest, based on what you wrote seems like you never put much thought into it.

979,cwe5we,False,Education,6,Is a Masters degree really worth it?,jobs,"Hello!

First time poster, but I thought I’d ask around a couple subreddits to get the a wider perspective of a major life decision I’ve been heming and hawing about for half a decade: Is a Masters degree going to help me find a job? 

 So here’s  my perspective. I graduated in 2013 with a BS in Biology and since then I’ve been working as a lab tech and worked my way up to a team lead position (basically pays the same and have the same work, but I also cover some of the more basic coordinating stuff and sometimes attend as a department rep when my boss is out). A couple years ago I wanted a new job and I COULD NOT GET INTERVIEWS. I applied, and applied, and applied but I just wasn’t getting calls. I’m not sure if my resume was awful or just didn’t meet the job experience expectations.  So, I figure if I can’t update my resume if I can’t get a new job maybe I should get more education. I got a couple of certifications through work (six sigma and excel certifications) and I worked for about a year studying for the GRE, taking it, and applying for a Non-thesis Biology graduate program. I can take classes for a couple years and then I’ll have a Masters in Biology. Great plan right?

Well, now I’m not so sure. What if I go through all this time and money, and I still can’t find a better job? Or now I’m a grossly overqualified lab tech who’s applying for jobs that pay $15 an hour but I’m expecting more since I have a Masters, but I lack industry experience for the typical jobs someone with a Masters applies for? My SO asked what job I’d want after school, and I said I wanted the same job just more money (but I don’t think they’ll pay a lab tech more to press buttons a machine just because I went to school for s couple more years) Is a Masters even necessary once you get to a certain point of job experience (Does someone with a MS and 1-2 of experience trump someone with 10+ years with a BS) My graduate school advisor was unhelpful bless her heart. She said that typically students who are non thesis MS either become teachers or go on to medical school, so she couldn’t tell me placement stats for my situation post-school.  My HR department couldn’t advise me either (“It’s a case by case basis. If someone doesn’t have a degree but has more applicable laboratory experience than another candidate, we have made exceptions since this is a hands on field”). 

I don’t want to go into debt if I can’t be guaranteed a better job position than what I currently have. Is a MS worth it? Has it been worth if for you? What sounds like the best decision?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cwe5we/is_a_masters_degree_really_worth_it/,1,"I think it many industries it will help set you apart on a resume and getting an interview and maybe being chosen over another candidate. Just because you have your Masters doesn't mean you will automatically get a job. I think it improves your chances of what I mentioned before, getting an interview, getting a leg up over another candidate with similar skills/years of experience. We also live in the age of basically the Bachelors degree being akin to a high school diploma, so anything above that is nice to differentiate yourself. Depending on cost(cost itself, plus losing out on wages while you are getting it) would it be worth it? It really depends. ",2019-08-28 01:50:54

So, before leaving for Ho Chi Minh City, I had been unemployed for an additional 1.5 years and my spotty, unemployment-filled resume coupled with my German and Scandinavian Studies degree made me an unappealing candidate to say the least.

So I have the opportunity to obtain one of these seven degrees tuition free, with the only caveat being that it has to be completely online.

The majors are: Biological Sciences, Software Engineering, Information Technology, Computer Information Systems, Business - Global Leadership, Urban Planning, or Philosophy.

I've always wanted to work with animals. So naturally growing up, my first instinct was to become a wildlife biologist. I still think it would be fun, I love working outdoors and have experience sea Kayak guiding where we came in contact with seals and whales.

However I don't know if a degree in Biological Sciences is enough to stand me out against people with degrees in Wildlife Biology or Marine Biology. Never mind the fact that an online Biology degree will be boring, as there are no labs or hands on experiments to conduct.

So I thought I should do something in demand like Software Engineering. I love computers, I love video games, but I've grown up with a disposition against math. I seem to have a heavy issue with mathematics, even advanced algebra has given me trouble. It's most likely because my ability to focus is hindered by ADD and DPDR, but I believe if I really need to get through a math class, I can take some modafinil and study hard all day. Do I love the idea of working on a computer all day, No, unless I'm working for a company I find interesting such as Bethesda, Reddit, or Google. I imagine being a person who has no experience coding that just because I have a degree in Software Engineering I would be hard pressed to get a job at these companies, right? I don't know about this one.

Then it makes sense that If I can't engineer software, I could learn to work with it right? Information technology surely can produce a high paying salary, I'd imagine. Same with Computer Information Systems.

Alternatively, Business - Global Leadership sounds sort of like International Business. I'm not sure how business degrees work, if they do land you high paying jobs in companies, or what I would even do.

Urban Planning sounds cool in it's idea. As does Philosophy. But we know where that route goes.

But I ran into the problem of being qualified but having no experience and like hell of I wanted to intern for years so I decided to get experience by joining the military. Now I'm getting paid to train on military IT systems. So not only do I get paid training but by the end of my contract I'll have 5 year's of IT experience. it's also opened me up to other areas of the field so if I specialize as a line man I can climb cell phone towers and travel alot amoung other things. Now joining the army.. not for everyone.

If I could say anything about self teaching in the civilian world it would be that you are responsible for the aggregation of knowledge. This is good because you pick what you learn but bad because you may learn advance courses before learning the basics or you might not now subjects exist at all. Your education is also very bias to things that interest you which may be to the detriment of your future employer. a structured college setting avoids this unless it's a bad course.

Last year I made about 60k before taxes. Its my dream job, I'm good at it and I love it.

  
In March, my current tour, future tours, and plan B local gigs all vanished with the pandemic.

Shows that actually pay enough to be worthwhile need big audiences, big venues, and most notably, big insurance policies that currently no one is giving out. It's also extremely hard work.

After an HR interview, I determined it's a bad fit. The work isn't interesting, I'd be forced to be at the office for weird hours to try to sync with the Pacific Time Zone despite being in Eastern, and I'd be in an office for no reason since I would not be interacting with anyone there (I asked).

I'm scared to turn it down because well....Covid-19 is making UX jobs harder to get and I'm scared for the second wave making things worse.

This will give you practice in a ""live"" setting.  Plus this will help get in the grove of answer the common interview questions that you are likely to receive.  Congrats, you made it past round 1.  

Check out my post on common questions during various stages:   [My Experience From Job Hunting](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt144v/my_experience_from_job_hunting/) 

A couple of other thoughts that I had:

* You can always take the job, and keep looking for a new place while employed (getting paid and health insurance benefits)
* I know absolutely nothing about UX jobs, but you said they are getting harder to get.  Why pass on an opportunity that has been presented to you?  
* Is it just the hours that is making you not want the job, not interacting with anyone in the office or is it something else?
   * If its just the hours, again not knowing your personal situation, I would not view this as an obstacle.
   * Is it not interacting with anyone in the office:
      * do you want to be in a office talking / working with others?
      * Is it the commute?
      * Is it concerns about the corona virus?
* Is it pay / salary?
   * again, tricky one with high unemployment.  You can always take it, and keep looking for a new gig.  You can explain that you are looking for a new place since it is a shorter commute, better benefits, etc...
* Did you pick up on a possible toxic work environment? Unrealistic workload / time deadlines, etc?
   * This is the trickiest one.  I always advise people to avoid a toxic work environment as it will demotivate you, which then typically leads to the quality of your work slipping.  Not to mention the anguish this can cause mentally on you at work and at home.
      * Just during the time we are in with unemployment around 20%, this makes it harder to just give a blanked statement of pass on this job since its toxic.

I would take the interview.  I would personally during this time, accept the job since you can always keep looking.  You can always explain an extremely short duration at a job by saying:

* Once I got into the position, I realized that the opportunity was not going to be a good fit for me.  The daily responsibilities and hours were different from what I was told that I would be doing during my interview.  The working environment and culture were completely different than what was presented to me during the interview.  I would like to leave it at that to be polite.
   * remember, don't bad mouth a past employer to a future employer.  This response will typically cease all inquiries from HR recruiters since they do not want to push you into bad mouthing an employee or getting into a potential grey area.
   * be prepared though after this response to talk about the hours and culture that you would work best in or are looking to work in

Again, I don't know your personal situation, but I would point out that the Federal Unemployment of $600 ends at the end of July unless it gets extended. ",2020-06-16 13:57:01

I want something that puts tasks as a priority first so I can accomplish what needs to get done without the pressure of having to arrive somewhere for a 9-5 job. I know some exist but I am wondering if there are jobs and companies that do solely this where they don't label the positions as ""40-hours per week"".

1015,h9f5ax,False,Covid-19,10,How to get back job offer taken away by COVID-19?,jobs,"Looking for some advice for my partner in how to secure (or resecure I guess) a job.

Prior to COVID-19, my partner applied for an amazing job with a multinational company that was a significant promotion from her current title and a key step in her career goals.
Following the interview, they decided to call her no longer that 1 hour later to say that she was a perfect applicant and they would even increase the salary by several grand per year over the listed remuneration on the ad.
Obviously she was ecstatic about this offer and accepted almost immediately and was due to start in roughly 3 weeks time and completed the required pre-employment medical that week.
Whilst waiting for the results of the medical to reach their hr team, covid came along and changed everything. The company overnight enacted a total hiring freeze. Her medical came back flawless and a contract was written and was meant to be getting mailed to her that day, but ultimately due to the new policies this role was no longer available.
The role was never formally rescinded and the hiring manager continued to assure her that they were working on it for over a week before all contact was dropped.

A month or 2 has passed now, and given job uncertainty in the near future we would love to try and find out if this role is still available and ultimately if they'd still be interested in hiring her.

So herein lies the questions,
How would you approach the company to find out if the job offer is still available? What would you even say? 
Would it still be acceptable to ask for the same offered salary particularly given the current climate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h9f5ax/how_to_get_back_job_offer_taken_away_by_covid19/,16,"Did she give notice at her prior job/is she still employed?

If it was me, I would reach out to the hiring manager or someone I interviewed with -- not HR. They will have a better feel for whether that position will be opening up in the next few weeks/months. Lots of times it depends on departmental politics, and HR isn't always in the loop on that. 

Sometimes hiring freezes end but new job reqs are dropped or go to the bottom of the pile - and by the time they open back up again, it might be a whole new team doing the hiring. 

That said, if this was a vital role and the manager had enough flexibility and authority to immediately offer her several grand above the advertised rate, I think there's still a good chance they still try to offer it to her. 

They needed someone in that role a few months ago.  They'll probably still need someone when this all blows over. ",2020-06-15 12:14:22

I have anxiety so I like to go into situations with a battle plan.  At the risk of sounding like Patrick Bateman, my battle plan for coming into a new job previously included:  


* Smiling easily and often
* Firm handshakes when first meeting people, with eye contact
* Asking coworkers/managers out to lunch to get to know them better/try to gain trust faster

All of these are impossible right now aside from eye contact, as I don't want to be touching new people, smiles will be covered by my mask, and I can't take people to lunch as restaurants are closed for dine in & employees are encouraged to eat alone when in the building, so as not to spread the virus (masks are off while eating).

I'm not sure how to feel about this virus. I didn't lose my job thankfully, but most of my friends and family did. I was working towards a promotion and would have made a year prior to the state of affairs, but now with the grim reality that my job has received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, I'm almost certain that my promotion is slipping away, as they can barely stay afloat. 

&#x200B;

While I am very grateful that I have a job still, my family does not, so I am the breadwinner in my household at the moment. It's a very scary feeling. I'm on all forms of government assistance, my housing complex provides food to low-income residents, and I'm applying to every form of monetary help I can. It all just seems so grim. 

All of my colleagues are able to find new jobs, with better pay, or higher job titles and all of the work I've done in my job so far seems trivial. All of the individuals with whom I've spoken to in passing, at the laundromat, at the coffee shop, front-desk receptionists, all seem so happy. 

&#x200B;

How can anyone be happy? I feel COVID-19 has ruined my chances at a real future. At a way to move up the corporate ladder. As a way to make a sustainable living. I'm a couple of years out of college, and as a millennial, had to deal with the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial housing crisis, 9/11, and now this.

1020,h7h67w,False,Covid-19,1,Worried I won’t be able to find a good enough paying job,jobs,"I was permanently laid off from my job in mid March at a nightclub on the Las Vegas strip. The club was slated to close March 28 pandemic or not but Covid sped that up to March 15

Leading up to the shutdown, I had 2 jobs lined up. The hotel that housed my nightclub was going to absorb me as one of their employees. I received an email a month ago saying that job has been canceled and they won’t be bringing me on

The other, I was hired, passed background and drug tests with flying colors but orientation was canceled thanks to the shutdowns. After a week of phone calls and emails that got me nowhere I finally was able to visit their employment center (another strip hotel) and I was told I’m not “officially hired until orientation is completed” meanwhile, the manager who interviewed and hired me gave me a call during the shutdown and told me I’d still have a job once they reopened. But I haven’t gotten called yet. The guy at the employment center told me to wait 2 weeks as they’re still getting everything organized and deciding what new hires to bring on and who isn’t. 

Being as this job is as a food server at the pool, the job would have been seasonal anyways and I probably wouldn’t start until July which would only give me 3-4 months worth of work. So I’m doubtful they’ll bring me on

I’m getting more and more anxious as time goes on. I’ve had 2 interviews at 2 off strip bars but nothing looks promising as of yet. 

Prior to moving to Las Vegas all my work experience was in retail, I never made more than $20k a year until I moved here. I made almost $60k in 2019....If I were to take one of those jobs it wouldn’t earn me enough to keep up on a $500 car payment and $1000 a month rent plus everything else, even if I worked 40 hours a week

If there’s anyone else in my situation how are you dealing with it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h7h67w/worried_i_wont_be_able_to_find_a_good_enough/,3,"I'm sorry you're experiencing this.  I hope for the best for you.  I was in a slightly similar position.  I was at a dead end job.  And i used  the the time in quarantine to take some personality and interest career tests.  O*Net is a good one to start with.  This will open other potential careers titles that you can search for, the best part is that they have separate lists for different levels of education.  I made a list of job titles that interest me, started searching job boards for them and reading all their postings and gradually compiling the skills, qualities and education they were looking for and keeping track of how they word things.

I then narrowed down on the titles or field that i thought i would do well and was capable of preparing for.  Then I sat down and wrote out all.my jobs, all my responsibilities --expanded resume, then googled all the hot key words that recruiters are looking for and how to reword to sound active and how my work reflected that skill. Rewrote my resume and cover letter. I then started looking at various certification programs and the price for jobs that needed more training while i was applying for one's that didnt require certs.  I found that cert programs are often cheaper than a degree.

I don't know you and don't know what the work of strip clubs entail, and I'm guessing you're okay with late nights, so that means you are mentally and physically capable of second and third shift.(They generally pay more)  You are able to multitask or prioritize tasks because you are dealing with loud high energy fast pace people and space.  You are very self aware, you know how to work as a team,  you value safety,  you able to quickly respond to situations, and you probably have great communication skills.

From retail, you have developing customer rapport, understanding customer needs, point of sales experience, teamwork, prioritising , understand chain of command, and maybe creating sale displays.

And the country is slowly reopening. Keep job boards on your phone,  indeed,  glassdoor, linked in.

And you can also spend the time creating a more professional social media personality.  Go through your Facebook, Twitter etc create a Linkedin There are lots of job coaches on youtube too that you listen to.

In March, a tornado came and destroyed the building and they got paid time off for about a week, then they had to relocate to a different state. It was okay, they got paid time and a half the entire time they were there which was about 2 months. They also got “compensated” for an extra week of PTO (40 hours). 
So in May they returned to their warehouse which is here in Tennessee but they’ve had almost no orders so for the past roughly a month, her entire team at work has been getting sent home early (after only working 4 hours, sometimes less than that) every day and sometimes they don’t even let them come in. Because of this, she’s either forced to use PTO or go without pay, which is crazy bc then she’d bring home about $250 a week compared to her normal amount of almost $600. 
Now it’s the middle of June and she’s almost through all of her PTO, leaving her with nothing left for the rest of this year and it isn’t even her fault considering she never misses work except for emergencies, but now she’s having to every single day.

I was working at my home country, it was a new job and I started to hate it because of the toxic environment. So when I got my student visa I gave a two weeks notice and left the job. The main reason was not the masters, it was the toxicity. My manager was pain in the ass. Anyways, I received an email from the university that they'll conduct the classes online because of corona, this happened just a day before I was supposed to fly. They also said that they classes have been postponed. 
This hit me pretty hard. It's seemed as though all my dreams had been put on pause for an indefinite period of time. Since my graduation (Bachelor's) I have had a job. I didn't know how to cope with this ""free time"". So I applied for a few jobs. I was also unsure if I want to pursue master's online, because it won't be the same as on-campus. And I applied for jobs that suited my skillsets, aligned with my career goals. I applied mostly at small companies, and only at one multi-national which is also the among the biggest corp in my home country. 

I had been a while, since this happened, and I had to decide whether or not to take online classes, so I availed the option and started my classes. It's been 2.5 months that I've been studying.
So the most unexpected thing happened. I got an interview call from that big company, and I got so excited, I went for the interview. It went well, then the final interview, and finally I landed the job! I couldn't believe it. I landed it so easily. Now they want me to join them, and this just seemed very foolish of me to pass the opportunity like that. I took my time to think about it and accepted the offer. But I'm still not sure, I haven't signed the contract yet. I've only accepted it verbally. 

I had my exams in July, but they've been postponed, the university says they next semester will probably be online as well. But it's not confirmed as of yet and they'll see how things evolve. Which makes sense. 

All of this uncertainty, made me accept the offer. But it really stresses me out when I think about leaving the job in a few months. ""What if the university calls on campus for exams?"" ""What if the next semester is on-campus?"" I know leaving a company in a few months does not leave a good impression and ruins the employee's reputation. 

I don't know what to do. Though writing this post has cleared my mind to some extend like I don't think joining was a stupid decision. But I want to tell my manager so that when I leave it doesn't come as a shock to him. But since it's a big company idk how soon a ""new"" ""entry-level"" employee should give out that information because that could really work out against me. But again, I don't want to drop a truth bomb, and just come up to them one day with the news that I'm leaving. 

I'm really enjoying studying. And I DO NOT want to put my masters on hold for this job. Legally, I can do both as long as I'm staying in my home country. 

In the interview, they didn't ask me anything regarding my future plans, expected duration of anything like that. They don't even know I'm doing master's.

I was thinking was casually dropping little info so they at least know about my master's. Instead of having a one-to-one serious meeting. 

This whole thing has been extremely stressful. I don't like disappointing people. And I want to leave as soon the classes start on campus. Masters is my first priority.

(the job I'm interviewing for is a dental receptionist)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gwanul/covid19_interview_questions/,2,"The only question that I would expect to be asked about Covid-19 is if you are fine wearing a mask or gloves for how many hours you would be working to be able to practice safe social distancing.

Focus on preparing for questions more based upon the role.  Do you have prior experience?  Are you able to use whatever computer program they use or have experience with a similar system?  How have you dealt with upset patients / customers in the past?  Do you know how to work the phone system? etc.

Again, I wouldn't worry about Covid-19 questions.  If they ask anything about it, it is likely to be if you are able to wear a mask/gloves for 8 hours.  If you are willing / able to disinfect the reception area every half hour.

These is a bona fide occupational qualification.  Can you practice safety in the work place?

Asking questions about health directly can lead to a disability claim very quickly if not asked properly.  Employers can ask if you are able to complete the required task. In your case:

* legal question:  are you able to wear a mask for 8 hours? or stated differently, the position requires you to wear a mask for 8 hours. Are you able to do this?  This position will require you to get up every thirty minutes to clean the reception area.  This may include reaching up, bending down, etc.  Are you able to do this?
* illegal question:  Are you allergic to materials masks are made from?  Do you have sensitive skin that would prevent you from wearing a mask? Do you have a bad back that would prevent from bending down to clean?

For example, if you are interviewing to be a security guard:

* legal question:  in this role, you will be required to stand up for 8 hours at at time.  Are you able to do this?  Are you able to stand and walk for 8 hours at at time?
* illegal question:  do you have arthritis? do you have a leg or back problems? ",2020-06-04 05:01:28

I'm struggling with deciding how seriously I should consider changing jobs with all of the economy and virus stuff going on. 

I (accidentally but successfully) negotiated the wage for the position up to $16 per hour on the initial call. I currently make $12.95 with a 10% shift differential most of the time for about $14.20 an hour on average. The pros beyond pay are that the new job would be very similar to my current one, but less stress with a more relaxed atmosphere. The new job would also be day hours instead of my current graveyard shift. Plus, my current job has no possibility of wage or position growth for me, unlike the new job. 

On the con side, the new job would be about 15 minutes further away than my current job. I have a reliable, efficient car though. Also, the new job may have slightly less job security in the face of coronavirus as I'm currently working on a federal subcontract. The big con is that in my industry, a term contract with possibility of hire at the end is standard, so the offer is 5 months with ""strong possibility of hire"".

Living out here in Houston, I feel like I get none of that. So for the past 4 years, I have been working really hard in my current company (i work in finance). I have pretty much mastered SQL and a bunch of other analytic tools that seem to make me standout in my field. I took a stab at applying to a few companies out of state and it seems to be working. I have been getting interviews and even got to 3rd round with one company before turning it down due to salary (salary not being on par with the cost of living in that city). So that got me thinking, would this be a good time to relocate? I am pretty comfortable in my current role and I love my co-workers. I make a decent amount and I am living comfortably. However, I don't see myself long term in this company and I have lived in Houston most of my life. I am kind of tired of driving down same street I grew up on and honestly, I just want change.

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gn09oc/furlough_situation/,1,"First, I'm very sorry this is happening. 

I'm not sure if it is or isn't in the bigger picture. 

Let's say you earn (pick a number) $70,000 / year.   Is it foreseen that you, in your position, will generate $70,001 or more for the company in the period from 19 May 2020 to 19 May 2021?  

And if not, then the company has two options:   

1. cut your salary to $69,999 (but a more round number like a 20% cut is more the norm, however it alters employment contracts and can leave a company open to labour board appeals), or 

2. cut the position, and disperse the job to people who are earning $40,000, and have that $30,000 gap make up for not only the losses encumbered from your salary, but also the efficiencies you generate (ie: are you generating $70,000 salary equivalent + $30,000 efficiency equivalent / year = $100,000 per year generated by you for the company?)

When the going gets tough, and if it's no longer clear, and if they're not convinced you are generating more than they spend on you, then layoffs happen.  And it's a lot tougher to justify efficient work habits and behaviours when customer revenu drops more than the efficiencies you deliver.

Here is a little background on my situation. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, have been on meds since. Throughout this time, I’ve always had a full time job, although in the last 2 years, switched around a few times to different companies (all in the retail sector).

Before covid, I was having a really hard time at my workplace. It was a very toxic environment and I was looking for new opportunities, working with a psychotherapist to manage my anxiety and issues, and making a little bit of progress. 

Then covid arrived, and I was temporarily laid off for the past 8 weeks. I applied for gov assistance (I live in Canada and it’s very helpful!). Within the first few weeks, I immediately noticed I was the happiest i had been in months, and working with my psychotherapist, attributed this to not being in the toxic work environment everyday. 

Fast forward to Friday of last week when I got the heads up that I’ll be going back to work this week. I have had the worst, most depressed, anxious weekend. I’ve had two panic attacks, crying/sobbing fits and my mind has been in another place, I can barely enjoy or think about anything else. 

There’s two main concerns of mine: one of course is going back to work during covid, nervous about the precautions and changes we need to make, my health and safety etc. But the other is going back into the environment that made me so miserable just a few months ago. I had issues prior to covid, but I feel as though the will be masked into just being “covid anxiety”. 

I can’t quit my job- 1. I need the financial support and 2. I do not want my mental health to result in me losing my job. I have been looking into short term disability leave, but again, I feel like they will assume I just have covid anxiety and it will be a fight to “prove” I had issues before this.

From the conversations I hear my coworkers have, they have been living “normally” outside of work, not wearing masks, going shopping whenever they want, visiting other peoples houses.

I was given a non-answer about how that employee calls off sick whenever she doesn’t want to come in, and “it’s probably not covid”.  I’m scheduled to work with this employee in a few days.

1055,gjvmo8,False,Covid-19,6,Tips for being Trapped for the Pandemic,jobs,"I want to start by saying: relatively speaking, I'm unbelievably fortunate to have a job given everything that's happening. A healthy majority of my friends have lost their jobs, and I know that I'm lucky to have not. This all said...

Before the pandemic, I'd started looking for a new job. My current job had been stagnant, with no room for growth, and it not being in my industry. Then the pandemic happened. For the first month I couldn't do work, because there were so many unknowns. But, over the past month, I've been doing basically two months worth of work, in much less time. The ability to turn down additional assignments or ask to only have meetings to be between 9 and 5 has gone away, with most higher-ups believing I have nothing better to do.  Yesterday I was in a meeting unrelated to my job, but wasn't allowed to leave as I 'surely had nothing but free time on my hands.' Last week, I spent an hour on a video call watching my boss plan a different meeting, and I was kept on the call in case he had questions.

The combination of an overbearing amount of work, the complete disregard for my time and personal life, and the inability to affect any change in my role has really started to take a toll on my mental health. Normally, these would be red flags for a person to leave, but with the job market dried up for quite some time... and I'm feeling incredibly trapped in my job,

Again, I know I'm fortunate (when discussing with friends/family, I've been described as being ""on the negative side of very lucky""), even compared to some co-workers. But spending 60 hours a week working a job that is ruining my mental health, while in a situation that's already mentally taxing...

I'm looking to see if anybody has any tips, thoughts, or suggestions on how to improve (or at least, make bearable) my situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gjvmo8/tips_for_being_trapped_for_the_pandemic/,4,"I’m in the same boat as you - I was starting to submit applications for new jobs right before the pandemic hit. My job has little growth opportunity and I had been feeling trapped for a few months before I started looking at new jobs.

Things have gotten worse with the coronavirus and WFH situation, with the company adding on way more responsibilities due to the increased disorder and frenzy. I receive messages and calls at all hours of the day. It’s gotten out of hand and the “trapped” feeling is just magnified. 

I have tried working on solutions with my supervisor but the attempts so far have done very little to ease the workload and expectations. 
I usually take pride in my work and have a fear of underperforming, so I tend to forget that a job is just a transaction. I dont know if you feel the same way but I hope it helps you out to remember that you won’t stay in this role forever, and in the meantime just go through the motions of your job and find something you like to do to ease your stress when your day is done. For me it’s been Animal Crossing and reality TV haha. 

In the end, since the volume is high and it’s out of your control, and it’s a job you are looking to leave in the future, do you care about your performance? For me, trying to let that part go (caring about doing well) has helped.

Edit: just wanted to add another comment on what you said about being lucky to have a job right now. I understand that feeling and the guilt associated with wanting to leave. There’s nothing wrong with feeling upset about a job that you hate, no matter what the situation is. If it’s mentally taxing and affecting your health, it’s a valid concern. ",2020-05-14 21:35:14

I work at a very small recruiting firm and was furloughed along with a few other coworkers due to Covid. A few weeks ago, because of the PPP loan, we were brought back. Since then leadership at my company seems to be doing everything they can to force people to quit, and this has escalated as we slowly transition back to the office this week. A few examples:
- If we are not “productive” enough or if we break any of the new procedures we will be sent home without pay for 14 days
- CEO outlined mask requirement in his plan but offline said he doesn’t care if we wear them or not. Also told us we are forcing ourselves back into the office because we failed at working from home
- I asked questions about the mask policy, what we’d do if someone becomes sick, etc. and received a link to the CDC as a response
- A coworker has an autoimmune disease and has been going into the office - they were asked if they’d prefer to just resign since that would be easier for the company 
- I asked to take PTO today instead of going into the office and was also asked the same question over the phone

Overall, I don’t know what to do. They’ve created a stressful, toxic environment that’s hard to deal with.

During winter break, and spring break I come in when I can, and over the summer I work at least 3 full days a week (most of my coworkers only work 3 days as well because the three of them all happened to be Jehovah’s Witnesses, unlike my boss and I, and they had requested that). 

My office and boss are extremely kind to me and always assure me that they want me to come back the next time I’m home from school, including this year. Normally I just set things up with the paralegal via email because my boss has a hard time fitting in non-client calls. 

But this year, which unfortunately is my graduation year when I need to save, the paralegal told me that my boss would call me soon and to let her know if he needs to be reminded.

I wrote a post in this sub a few weeks ago regarding job burnout - unfortunately I’m still at this job, but am actively applying to jobs every single day! In the meantime, I wanted to ask about something specific I’ve been dealing with for maybe 1.5 months. 

I was given a responsibility at work that I think is inherently wrong. Without explaining it too much, we’re deducting pay for a service currently closed during quarantine, and there are about 50 employees who will not be getting a credit or refund for these deductions, and they’ll be leaving the firm in June (this was decided by upper management). I’ve been basically tasked to tell these people “well, sorry, not our problem!” (That’s more or less a quote from my boss). 

I feel like I’m helping rob people, and it’s honestly making me sick. I have a long history of depression & anxiety which I can keep in check for the most part, but since these decisions were made- I am constantly nervous and on the brink of tears (or just crying), I’ve bitten all my nails off, and I’m having a really difficult time keeping up with my other responsibilities. I’m really not trying to be dramatic about any of this, I’ve just never felt so strongly that something I was doing was wrong. Another issue is that I have a hard time separating professional from personal, so when people vent to me about this, it just completely drains me. 

Am I allowed to tell management that I’m not comfortable with this responsibility, or will this reflect badly on me? (I’m trying to leave the firm anyway so I’m not sure that it’s worth it).

On March 23 we recurved what looked like a copy pasted message from one of the higher ups in the fast food chain. It stated starting on As of that day (3/23) employees will be receiving a 25% pay increase until further notice.  The owner of the store I worked at then sent a follow up message stating it would go into affect 2 days later (3/25) due to when I payroll reset.  

I noticed at first that nothing was changing, but just figured it was taking an extra cycle to come into affect.  I was paid again this morning and once again it didn’t seem to reflect this update.  I went into the app we use and added up the hours for the previous two weeks, the last pay period, and with tax the amount matched the amount I was paid.  That is, without the 25% “hazard pay”.

I’m one of the newer employees, started just over two months ago, and one of the younger ones as well (18).

I was inching closer to leaving my job before the whole COVID thing started (as in, when my country went into full lockdown I had a four week timeline to start looking for the next job). 

But then this whole thing exploded and I got trapped here, in a job that basically exhausted its possibilities and with bosses that don't take our health seriously. Even if a lot of us could work from home full time, they still make us go to the office one or two days a week. 

I'm personally not happy with that and I'd like to look for another job, but I'm not sure how good of an idea it would be.

I spoke with my manager last week and was ensured that my position is secure and has been justified to HR on their end however, I have yet to hear anything from HR in response to an email that I sent last week requesting an official employment reassurance letter and information regarding said pay cuts and potential furloughs.

It's getting down to the wire, as I am set to move in three weeks and need a letter to verify all of my employment contingencies have been met for my home loan. Though I know it's a crazy time right now, I can't help but feel that HR is dragging their feet. 

My question is, how long do I give them to respond before ""bugging"" them again (it's been 10 days)? Should I apply for new positions in anticipation of them backing out, due to COVID-19? 

More so, what would you do if you were faced with these issues?

Hoping I can ask your advice.

I am currently furloughed due to the COVID19. They made it clear that this was not performance based and the intention was to bring furloughed employees back once they could. Basically everyone on my particular team was furloughed either partially or fully.

I've been taking this time off to try and explore next steps within my career and how to improve. I've applied to some jobs and have started hearing back. I have a story ready on why I'd like these particular roles (want to get into a role more focused on marketing), but should I also disclose the fact that I am currently furloughed to appear upfront and honest?

1092,g5jljf,False,Covid-19,2,"Struggling to find work in my field and I want to change careers, but not sure what the smartest steps during a time like this.",jobs,"I recently graduated with a B.S. degree in IT and moved to Raleigh for a help desk specialist position. Just two months into my contract, COVID-19 wrecked the company and cuts were made. My contract  was cut almost a month ago and so far the competition has skyrocketed and I  can’t find work in IT. Filled for unemployment and I have enough saved for 3-4 months.

Its been almost a month and I keep getting told that there are hiring freezes. Other problem is that people with more experience have also lost their job and are picking up all the temp work. When I first moved to the area I had 4 interviews the first week and had a job the second week...

Before I went for my degree I was already interested in Web dev and had taken some free courses online.  I took two classes in web development at college that covered html and css and some JavaScript. Reinforced that I really enjoyed it.

Since then I got caught up with my classes and other areas in IT. I  graduated and moved to Raleigh for the help desk job thinking I was  going to pursue something in IT.  I honestly have not enjoyed my help desk role and have no interest in other fields in IT.

Web dev has been in the back of my mind for years. Being let go from work has given me a lot of time to think about things. I started learning again and really want to pursue it.

I am concerned about the economy. Competition for jobs are up and I know that even before COVID-19 competition is high for entry web dev jobs. So I am concerned that I may struggle to find work in what looks to be a recession. But so far I have had no luck finding work in IT anyways...

Another thought. I have no job currently and my experience points to me trying to find a new help desk job.  But I want to change my career focus. The pressure to get a help desk job is to get that first 1-2  years experience in IT. However, I am not sure that I should be focused on that if I want to do web dev.  So maybe its ok if I choose alternative work while I work on getting a web dev job? If I decide to go back to IT in 6 months I can excuse my absence easily because of COVID-19.

sorta tldr:

So to sum it up, I dont know if I want to try to compete for a job I dont want. If I wanted to pursue IT I should be getting certs and working on homelabs and stuff. I should be pushing to make connections and writing cover letters and fine tuning my resume. All for something I do not want longterm. But whats the alternative? Work at Target or something that pays near poverty wages until I get a portfolio together and start applying for web dev positions. I could theoretically make that work. I havent been approved for unemployment yet so here's hoping for that (I worked all through college).

Competition will be high and if I want to change my career focus I am not sure where I should be focused. Not everyone reading this will understand the differences in IT and web dev, but could have a say in switching careers in a time like this. I do believe the degree relates enough to look good for jobs, but I will need to build a portfolio.

Background: I received and accepted a written job offer on Monday.

The HR rep never gave me a timeline on how long this step would take and she also hasn't given me an expected start date.

The drug screening was done through Lab Corp and several friends have suggested they're likely inundated with coronavirus tests, which I can believe.  My other question is when is it appropriate to follow-up with HR if I haven't heard anything to make sure all my ducks are in a row?

I’ve been a Medical Assistant for 10 years. Just moved to another state with my husband after a lifetime of living in CA. It’s been a difficult adjustment especially with Covid going on and to top it off, my mom was diagnosed with cancer and started chemo in the midst of us moving.

So I need help trying to come up with a response to an email from an online job that I applied for sometime ago.

They want me to move on top the next step of the application. I am still interested, but my problem is that I no longer am sure if I can do the work because of the present situation that we are in with the pandemic. My partner is now working from home, I have a good savings despite being laid off, and I have started collecting unemployment, so we are comfortable and I would probably get more from unemployment than I would the job (20 hours a week at $12.50 and hour). Initially, I applied for the job because I work in education and we have a lot of breaks.

I  don't think that I can handle the job at the moment because, quite frankly, my dog has been a nightmare to deal with the last few weeks. I am also trying to keep on top of helping a family member adjust to online learning that started up this week. But mostly, it is the darn dog! She is just over a year and still puppy-ish and also a demanding breed (she's half-Great Pyrenees). We're struggling enough to keep her occupied while my partner is working. I love her a lot, but she's still in training and very much a ""I'll do what I want when I want to"" type of dog.I cannot imagine it going well if both of us try to work at the same time. Is there a way that I convey this to the employer? I don't think it is wise to say that the reasons are due to my dog. 

Would something like be acceptable to respond to their email with?:  ""Due to unforeseen family related circumstances that have arisen due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, though I am interested in the position, I find that right now I cannot commit to enough time to this job opportunity. Is there any chance that I can defer interest for now until a better time comes along?""

The job is supposed to be a flexible, independent contractor position, and they post opportunities frequently, so I don't think that they are exactly counting on me for the job or that I am their first pick, if that makes sense.

1117,fpmbjy,False,Covid-19,2,"Refusing unsafe working conditions vs. coming into work - either way, my finances are screwed",jobs,"x-post social work

 I currently have a non-patient care role at an inpatient facility. My governor ordered that all non-essential/non-life sustaining workplaces shut down due to COVID-19. The geographic area I'm in has been hit very hard by COVID, so the shelter in place is absolutely necessary. As a healthcare facility, my workplace needs to stay open to continue to meet patient needs. However, my employer is taking the fact that the workplace is ""essential and life-sustaining"" to mean that every employee needs to continue to do their job physically in the facility. My position could be done from home, but my department's requests to telework have been denied. We got a memo that explained ""all employees are essential employees"" so therefore telecommuting during the pandemic is not allowed. Even though my job doesn't involve face-to-face patient interaction, I frequently walk past patients in tight hallway spaces, my department uses a patient lounge as a meeting room, patients often use staff bathrooms, etc. If COVID sweeps through our patient population, there's a high likelihood I could catch it if someone sneezes at the wrong time. My workspace is also not in compliance with CDC social distancing recommendations, so if my coworker one desk over gets sick, it's likely I would too. Did I mention there are several staff members currently on quarantine? Most likely, they passed COVID along to other employees before the health department ordered them to stay home.

On many levels, the fact we still need to physically come into work is so concerning. Many of our patients have conditions that affect their immune system, so it's in their best interest to limit the number of people in the building to reduce their chances of exposure. For the sake of the nurses, housekeepers, and dietary staff who do not have the ability to perform their roles remotely, it's also important to limit transmission and have anyone who can work remotely to stay home. This has been brought to management's attention, but we're being told it's not fair to have some employees work from home while others have to come in. Not fair?!!? It's not fair to our patients if we don't have enough nurses on hand because they contracted COVID from an asymptomatic billing staff member who was not permitted to telecommute. It's not fair to the housekeepers making $12 an hour if they incur thousands of dollars in hospital bills, all because they ran into a quality assurance staff member with COVID in a tight stairwell. (These are fictional examples, but they have the chance of becoming reality if things don't change). Of course, our safety as employees in telework-compatible roles is at risk, and any one/all of us could come down with COVID when we could have just stayed home and practiced social distancing. I'm concerned about a vulnerable family member of mine whose health could be needlessly jeopardized by my employers insistence that EVERYONE works in the office.

Because of the fact my telework request was denied, I now have a difficult decision to make. Management told me we have the right to refuse to come in if we don't feel safe, however once we roll through our PTO we would have to take the leave unpaid. My job/benefits would be held, but I would have no money coming in. The state of emergency could stretch on for months, so I am very concerned since my PTO will be gone next week. I can't afford to be off of work without income for a prolonged period of time, but I also can't afford to go to work and contract COVID. Outside of work, I have only been going out into public once a week to get groceries and gas, so if I take unpaid leave then my chance of getting COVID would be small. But in the event there happens to be airborne COVID particles in the checkout line, I don't know how I would afford my medical bills without any income. I have enough savings to last me for two months, but that is only if there are no emergencies during that time. My health insurance has a very high deductible, so if I get hospitalized I am absolutely screwed. Given the employees with COVID exposure at work, it seems likely I will get COVID if I return to work, but I would be in a (slightly) better financial situation to handle this.

It looks like we may be headed toward a global recession, so the idea of not working for several months is terrifying. I also have a family member who was laid off due to a COVID closure, and it's possible she could be unemployed for months. I may need to help her out financially in the event there are issues with her unemployment application. Then I ask myself: what would happen if I get permanent lung damage from work-acquired COVID and incur thousands of dollars in medical costs each and every year as a result? Or what would happen if the family member who lives with me gets it? They are in a high-risk demographic and the mortality rate is absolutely terrifying. Ten years from now, I don't want to be thinking to myself ""if only I had stayed home from work...""

It feels irresponsible to take unpaid leave, but it also feels irresponsible for me to jeopardize my health and the health of my family. If only my employer agreed to let us work from home, this could all be avoided! I wish I knew an actuary who could run simulations of all the various scenarios that could happen if I go back to work versus if I take unpaid leave.

Finally, after months, a company I was excited about made me a great offer for a position that was an advance in my career. This was about a month ago, I started a couple of weeks ago. And then...coronavirus. My current job is 100% reliant on the ability of people to socialize in person, but is not a restaurant that can pivot and offer delivery or take out. I still have my job as I am in the corporate office and they plan to reopen, but I don’t know how long they can keep paying us when no one knows when we will be able to open again.

When I was interviewing for this position, I was also interviewing with another company that I was equally excited about. They didn’t move as fast as the place I work now, but I kept the conversation open as I wanted to at least see it through if they wanted to continue to move forward. This position is a pay cut from the current, and a lateral career move from my prior positions, but they are more focused on the digital space, which feels more secure at the moment. They made me an offer this week and I am so torn on what to do. The pay is less of an issue as there is great room for advancement, and it’s great pay for the position, but it is about 1k less per month take home. 

Both companies are great companies, commute (if and when that happens) are minutes different, similar benefits packages, great company culture. If it wasn’t for covid, I’d likely stick with my current position since it’s a great career move and there is nothing I could complain about really. 

To make this harder, because I was on unemployment the last few months, I don’t have any left to claim should I stick with this job now and get laid off shortly after. 

I know no one knows what is going to happen with this coronavirus, but I am looking for any opinions or advice, maybe something will click and help with my decision.

1122,fmq8j5,False,Covid-19,5,I went from loving my job to hating it! How can I adjust to this change?,jobs,"I was working in a new hospital cafe. It opened in July of 2019, and I have been working there since August. It was like a mini cafeteria. We were a small team. It was 6 of us in total, including the manager.

Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, they shut our cafe down and decided to shove all of us down to the main cafeteria.

The cafeteria downstairs is a completely different work environment from our cafe.

It's too cluttered down there. It's too many people. Like everyone is all in your face. The staff down there aren't very nice. And all the positions down there are pretty much filled. So it's like we are getting in everyone's way.

I was trying to help out some of the employees with prep by making sandwiches. One of my coworkers from my cafe was over there as well. One of the workers stepped away for a moment, and I guess I was taking over her job. When she came back she was like, ""Okay, you are in my space!"" She was kind of rude about it. Even my coworker told me, ""She wasn't really doing anything anyway.""

My position at my cafe was Utility/Inventory. I washed dishes, did general cleaning, counted inventory, and helped out with prep cooking and line cooking as needed. I tried to help out the dishwashers in the cafeteria with dishes, and they all told me that they are fine and that they got it. It's like they don't want me helping them.

I've been cleaning the dining area in the cafeteria. I've been doing all the utility. There is already a Utility person in the cafeteria. He's a little lazy and doesn't really do his job. I've been doing all of his work. People are telling me to stop doing all of his work for him and have him do it himself, but I am honestly just trying to stay busy because there isn't really anything to do.

When I am done cleaning the dining area, I have nothing else to do!

And I am baffled as to why the seating area in the cafeteria is still open? Groups of people are still eating in there. I know with the coronavirus going around, they are trying to avoid having groups of people together. I think the seating area should be closed, and it should be carry out only.

Also, I think it was unnecessary for them to close down our cafe. I just think they should've closed our seating area, and it should've just been carry out only. The other eatery in the hospital is a coffee shop, and they are still open. The seating area is closed in the coffee shop.

I hate it down in the cafeteria. Our cafe is perfect. It's a small crew, smaller facility, everyone is in their own space, my manager is amazing, the crew is great, the environment is great, etc.

This coronavirus is ruining everything. I hope this shutdown don't last until the summer because I don't know if I can stand working in the cafeteria for that long.

I didn't start working until I was 21. I waited late because I've been dealing with terrible Social Anxiety my entire life. Within the past two years, I've been trying to challenge myself to overcome it.

The fact is that a lot of us, even those of us who are experienced, are figuring things out as we go.  Secondly, no two jobs or organizations are the same, so finding a perfect segue from one job to another is nearly impossible.  To then have to lie about your current experience or abilities to get a job, and then have to live up to these expectations, helps nobody.  

As someone who tries to be forthcoming and honest at work about expectations (and maybe a little too much so), I've seen it hurt my opportunities so many times.  Furthermore, I see people in positions that they should never be in, simply because they were better at selling the lies about where they're genuinely at with regards to skills and experience.  Their inexperience and lack of skill, as a consequence, often hurt morale and productivity of the team they are placed on or oversee.  

In contrast to this, I think the hiring process should be more transparent and forthright from all parties.  Maybe this transparency will lend more to opportunities of getting actual formalized on-the-job training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.  If everyone isn't out there lying or faking it to get a job, then companies would have no choice but to invest in training and development if they want to find the candidates they are seeking.  Furthermore, it'd help morale and productivity on teams because then you're not dealing with the repercussions of a manager or colleague who is out of their element trying to *fake it till they make it*.   

What are your thoughts?  Has faking it till you make it gone too far in the sense that it creates an environment where the best con artist wins out, and then everyone else is forced to deal with the consequences of a poor hiring decision when there are no formal training or mentor programs in place to accommodate?

This job is an administrative job with the ministry of health so not like there is a conflict of interest between the 2 jobs. I just graduated nursing school and landed a job as a public health nurse and it pays double what I'm getting at my part time job but it's specific to COVID response and therefore the job is temporary, probably lasting a few months. I think this would be a great opportunity for me and would hate to give it up because of a few scheduling conflicts. It would look great on my resume and would allow me to make a good amount of money for a few months. Whereas my part time job pays way less but has been my stable job I've been able to pay rent off of and live pretty frugally with.

There are a lot of scheduling issues with the new job as they have scheduled me Sunday-Thursday 10am-6pm with Friday and Saturday off, and my part time job is usually Tuesday & Friday 4-8pm with alternating weekends. I've been able to speak to some coworkers and get them to cover me on some days and weekends but there is one reoccuring weekly shift the Tuesday 4-8 at my part time job that I'm not able to get covered, and I can't just show up 3 hours late to my shift, so asking my current manager to compromise isn't even an option I think.

So I'm thinking my only option is to speak to the new manager and ask them if I can be changed to the 8-4 shift just on Tuesdays so I can rush to my 2nd job. In the job offer they stated my schedule was fixed and that I had to work all the offers but I'm wondering if there may be some flexibility to that. I'm afraid I might come off as being uncooperative or difficult having just been a new hire and I'm scared of jeopardizing my contract with them or having them let me go. They hired 15 other nurses as well.

I'm getting mixed advice from different people. Some people are telling me it's best to be honest from the get go and let the new job know about my scheduling issues and that I've tried my best to resolve them with my other job but am having difficulty with this one day every week and that this would be easier to figure out from the start rather than wait till after orientation and bring it up 2 weeks after starting. And some people are telling me this could come off as me not being dedicated to this new job and that I'm being difficult and would leave a bad impression to the point they would let me go, or that it looks bad that I', working a party time job ontop of this. Quitting my part time job is not an option as I need this after my contract ends with my new one.

Hi guys, I could really use some help with this situation (see below for details):

I got a job in a different city (from where I am currently located) which starts at the end of July. I received the offer at the end of April, and was told that it is conditional upon completing fingerprints. I then received a revised offer letter (in May) stating that although the employment is conditional on the fingerprints , if they aren't able to complete them in time, the start date would still be the same but ""continued employment"" is dependent on this.

I was asked to provide location preferences as to where I will be working as there are multiple site locations (it is a school). I still do not know where I will be working. I followed up about this over 2 weeks ago and they apologized and said they would be in touch the next week with more information... But they never sent more information. I am not sure how pushy I should be given that at this point no one knows whether schools will re-open in the Fall.

I just got an email on Friday saying that I need to schedule my fingerprints in the next 2 weeks. I just checked and the fingerprinting place in the city I am living now doesn't offer the service I need (yes, there are some like 40 miles away but I also am not comfortable going at the moment because I am living w/ elderly parents). I checked today and the fingerprinting sites in the city where the job is located are open... I ideally do not want to move before I know where I will be working.

I am not sure how to handle this.  Should I follow up with the person who sent the fingerprinting info and ask if I can get my fingerprints done right before the start date instead of in 2 weeks ?

The email also said: If you have any questions, please email {email address}... does this mean I should email or should I try calling? If email, what should I say in the email?

1157,g6mbna,False,Onboarding,8,How to gain back confidence after being fired twice in a row?,jobs,"So this whole situation started late 2018 when i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, after i was given an offer for a really good opportunity to work at an highly respected company to start Jan 2019.

When i started the job i disclosed my mental illness at the time as this company gave the impression that they care about their employees mental health, and that they had a number of mental health ambassadors around so if someone needed to talk they could have a chat with one of them. This obviously appealed to me at the time as i felt as though i could be open... boy was i completed wrong.

Things started to hit the fan only a few days into this job where my manager caught me crying outside the office, and she told me that i was not capable of this position and that they needed someone strong to be in this position and it was a highly pressured role dealing with various reports and having meetings with senior managers and directors. Now her response did take me back, so i plead with her to give me a chance and that i can make this work.

Now to cut a long story short here my manager was micromanaging me as this was her first time being a manager so i figured she didn’t know how to manager due to being inexperienced. So i carried on doing what I’m doing and then she started becoming hostile and shouting at me for things like spelling issues, fonts not right and not cleaning the email mailbox. 
Now to be honest my mental health through this got worst as i was making mistakes but i felt i could not concentrate as my manager was always on my back making me feel more nervous, and at times every task i would do i felt i would have to run it past her just to see if i was doing the work to her standard. But all this came to backfire on me as i was fired at the end of my probation and one of the major feedback points were that i did not take initiative and that i felt everything i do had to be audited

The second job i started this year in January and from the start i noticed that manager that was trying to train me wasn’t clear in her expectations of what i was supposed to be doing in the role and i found my self having to ask her over and over what i needed to be doing. Once i started getting an hang on what i was supposed to be doing she would say things like ‘ i didn’t say, if you remember i said’ but the thing is i was documenting everything she said and i even told her this but she claimed she could not recall her saying anything i told her she said. So during my time at this job i noticing more and more that my manager backtracks on everything that she says, its almost like she has amnesia and also she would say small things that would offend me like ‘I’m not a senior as I’m not doing senior work’ but when i would ask her for specifics she was say ‘well your a senior you should already know, and its not my job to tell you your job’ so after this i reported her to her manager as at the time i didn’t want to speak to HR yet and her manager advised me that he will go to HR on my behalf and obviously that backfired and i was let go about 3 weeks after that 

Now prior to these two jobs i had a really good career and done my job at an excellent level according to previous employers and coworkers. But I’m not gunna lie these last two jobs really took a hit at my confidence and it had make me question my competency in my career. I realised that the problems at these two roles were me and managers jointly. So during the quarantine i have been doing different courses and researching materials online with relation to my role and to also improve my mental health so that i try and gain back the confidence lost, however i cant help these negative thoughts about not succeeding in my next role. Like what if i get a manager that doesn’t train properly or once that micromanages how do i at least survive probation.

1170,ffzrn0,False,Onboarding,2,"Impostor syndrome, or is it just that I’ve been misjudged in giving that job?",jobs,"I have just started a new job 3 weeks ago, in which I feel hugely out of my depth. Now, I’m no rookie, I have been working in this field (higher education) for the last 20 years, but I feel I have no idea how to do this new job! I have worked in the UK, in mainly successful or very successful universities, in administrative roles (exams, paperwork of any sort, meetings, daily life, lectures timetable...etc) I have now started in a tiny (50 students total) private uni in Europe. This organisation has no money (website is on a free site, marketing budget for the year barely covers the minimum requirement: we have limited supply of brochures, which are needed to advertise!, only 2 of us in marketing and recruitment -my new title- money for 1 international student fair and about 10 in the year in Europe). Basically, compared to the budget/reputation I worked at in the UK, it’s maybe 5% of what I knew... so, restrictive is not even the word. To compound my feelings of going nowhere, I have been given a marketing and recruitment role (managing one other person doing just marketing -he’s young and good at it, but scattered in his approach and his English needs reviewing a lot), while I have zero experience in marketing and as for recruitment, I used to attend students fair about 10 times a year, but never really thought about it too seriously, because we weren’t really begging for students to enrol. In this role, I’m expected to have concrete results, with no tools or skills to do the job!! I feel so inadequate! My partner says it’s typical to feel this way after 3 weeks, that I need to structure my day in researching things, that I have imposter syndrome, but because I’m hard working (already done 5 hours extra that I need to get back -not that I think I’ll be able to, because I’m so busy all day... but not actually doing anything of substance). Basically I’m unprepared in my method, because I don’t know what I am supposed to do! I think ‘I cannot sell the program with such a crap website’, so I go and try and improve it, it takes 4-5 hours and is marginally better after that, but then, it’s still not great. Then I research potential partnerships with other universities (so they could maybe send students to us for a semester or two), but I have no idea how to approach them formally, what to suggest, even if they’d laugh at the idea... Again, my partner says you could just try and see, you lose nothing, but I think I may lose a good opportunity by just suggesting something random and ridiculous. I recently contacted someone who organised a ‘concerting’ of universities for quality purpose, but she immediately dismissed me, as we’re nit of the caliber she’s after. Basically, I do not know HOW to go about things... at all... and it somehow paralyse my every attempt. I research things to death, and I waste time, faff and don’t achieve much... I know it’s been 3 weeks, but again, I haven’t managed to secure one meeting with an international school nearby (as it’s a program offered in English, in Belgium).

Are there other small universities that might have administrators with limited resources such as you are experiencing? Maybe you could connect over coffee; even if they feel they are equally lost as you feel it is someone you can bounce ideas off!

\- Your boss is busy worrying about their own work. 

\- Make your boss's life easier.

\- If you don't understand what is being asked of you, ask for clarification.

\- If you have an issue with someone, talk to that person first.  Don't complain to others. 

\- Every day, write down a list of the most important things you need to do - it may be 2 or three things.   At the end of the day, review the list.   If you're not sure what should be on the list, review with your manager. 

\- Never talk disrespectfully about your manager to anyone at work. People talk to each other. 

\- Never put in writing something you don't want others to read. 

\- Learn, learn learn.  Take every training opportunity to learn more about your job, company, industry. That is how to get ahead.

\- Be present.  You're paid to be there, do that. It's half the battle.

So I feel like I’m in a pickle right now. This September, I had worked at a company (my first job) for only a week.

I updated my references (who I had used for that job) about my quitting and the fact that I’m back in the job search.

So last week, I got an offer for my dream job at a different company. I supplied my employer with the same list of references I had used for my previous job. I’ve basically cleared everything in the onboarding process besides the reference check (because all of my references were out of office during the break). The more I wait for the reference check to complete, the more anxious I get about them mentioning my first job (for some random reason)...  I omitted that position from my resume/application and basically told my interviewers that I’ve been searching for jobs and finding myself blah blah blah since I’ve graduated.

So ultimately, my question is, should I ask my references not to mention my previous job during the reference check? If so, how can I phrase it? Thanks so much!

Initially I used to bow down to everyone who said it's me who is to be blamed but it was taking a toll on me. One day my manager shouted at me in front of everyone for no reason and I had to go to the HR, after which I was terminated in two weeks.

Now they're claiming money from me that they provided for relocation & a joining bonus. I'm really feeling lost right now being unemployed and I want to know if there's anyone here who has failed the probationary period as well and what you did afterwards to recover. 

Hoping for suggestions. Thanks :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/doox4z/is_there_anyone_who_didnt_pass_their_probation/,2,"You've been posting threads in various subreddits and deleting them afterwards for about a week now. I think you need a bit of a reality check. 

They hired you from another continent, that's the very first context you need to realise. Hiring like this is extremely expensive and risky for them, and does not happen usually except in cases one needs a specialist that can't be found locally. Even though Amazon is a global company it very much will want to keep hiring locally to the office you're meant to be at, because everything else is a logistical mess. So what this tells me is that you were meant to have some skill or background that was hard to get.

The fact that you kept bringing up lack of training and support doesn't chide well with the fact that you were hired for some specific skills you were meant to have. Yes there is usually a ramp-up period for newcomers, but generally this happens within the first month and by the third month one should already be working productively 80% of the time. 

Things blowing up and you going to HR complaining about lack of training could very well just seem that you were not possessing the skills that they expected you to have when they hired you. They expected somebody to come on board and be able to work productively, not still require training after several months. 

Over the ensuing threads you made and the panic you're in right now, it seems you hadn't fully realised this possibility and what exactly a probation period actually means. Especially in a European country like you're in right now, one does not consider a job to be secure until the probation period is over - it's one line of defence companies have against bad hires as past that it's extremely hard or very expensive to fire somebody without grave reason (Benefits you are getting is paid by the company).

Reclaiming relocation expenses and bonuses is standard practice in *any* company essentially anywhere. You will not find any job that gives out a bag of cash without having assurances they'll be keeping the hire for a long time and get a return on their investments. ",2019-10-29 12:13:49

They bill Verizon like $50 an hour for your work, they pay you like $25-30, spend some amount on payroll tax and benefits (they do give PTO and normal benefit stuffs I think) and pocket the rest.

I'd avoid going through them unless you are certain you can't land a job directly, at say Verizon yourself.

On the plus side, if you're someone that are unable to step into the field this is an easy way in. After a year or 2 you have exp on your resume and job search become incredibly more easy.

All in all, it's not a scam, but it's not a super great job comparing to normal software developer job because they take a cut and benefits are general worse than the actual company (Verizon or w.e) benefits.

I was in my previous role for around 18 months, and left due to a toxic environment, which led to never-ending staff shortages, significantly heavy workload for low pay, etc. My new role was literally created as a new position, as it is considered a ""hybrid"" position to take on 3 different roles between these 2 locations, and offered me slightly more pay than my old job. I also understood that accepting a newly created position could be more challenging, as management is kind of learning how to provide the best supervision/management, as I learn how to make the position more of my own. This management ""learning curve"" has also resulted in several issue that have required mediation between multiple supervisors and directors (which they are supposedly taking responsibility for, and aren't faulting me, but I still feel very uncomfortable about the situation).  Although I am definitely learning a lot more in my new position (I've been doing a lot of self-education outside of work also), I am still feeling super overwhelmed in my new position, and feel inconsistently supported by my supervisors. Most of my coworkers are nice, but I do not feel like I fit in with any of them, as most of them are all 10-40 years older than me, and married with children (which I am not), and just have very different personalities than me, so I sometimes feel even lonelier and more lost at my new job with few people to turn to for advice, etc. I also feel like when I ask questions, these people with more experience appear to sometimes get frustrated for something that seems so ""simple and easy"" to them, but may not be that way for me, as a newer employee. My new department also is very similar to my old department in some ways-it's not as ""toxic"" as my old job, but there are some very opinionated and close-minded colleagues that are also making my job significantly more challenging to complete (which again, my supervisor is aware of, and trying to mediate to the best of her ability, supposedly). I have started looking at other potential jobs, but the job market is very saturated for my profession, so my options are limited. I also worry about leaving so soon, and having other employers potentially believe I am a ""job hopper"", which I know can carry a negative connotation.

27 May: I sent required documents to Lawyer

(no response from Lawyer; I sent one or two emails to ask for updates)

12 Jun: Lawyer replied and scheduled a skype call for the next day

13 Jun: Skype call to discuss visa application

11 Jul: I visited the embassy to make visa application (this was the earliest embassy appointment I could secure after my call with Lawyer)

The HR and Lawyer had been largely slow in response and passive at best. To make matters worse, my visa application on the 11 Jul failed because we simply applied for the wrong visa category. Prior to the visa application, I have suspected that I may be applying for the wrong visa category (through the contents of an official document from the host country) and tried to reconfirm with the Lawyer. However, the Lawyer insisted that she was correct and I followed her recommendations in the end.

After the failed visa application attempt, the Lawyer expressed her opinion that the Embassy in my country was 'fussy and difficult to deal with' so I doubt she realized the error in application. I kept quiet and began working with her on our second attempt at it.

The preparation of my second visa application required the company to pay a fee for an official process in the host country. The Lawyer and I made that clear to the company and a few days ago, I received an email from HR '...we will contact you when we decide if and how we can support'. My heart sank.

This is where I am at right now. What I can surmise from all of this is that the decision makers (without knowing what's happening on the working level) in the Company are thinking that:

* The recruitment / visa application process is taking too long
* It is simply too damn difficult to get this person from X country to go through visa process

And with that, are probably deciding if it is worth the effort to pursue this further.

What do you think is my best course of action from here? Please take note that I'm still interested to join the company as the team I'll be working with are great.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm wondering what I can say to the decision makers to try to rectify the situation. My thought is to tell them of the events that transpired (similar to what I did above) and convey that I understand how it can be when resources are constrained but it nevertheless led to the delays in my case. And also to tell them what should have been an open-and-shut case at the Embassy was made complicated due to the mistake that was made. Of course I'll be as diplomatic as possible.

They first called on November 14th for a first screening, then scheduled for a skype interview on december 5th, then gave me an offer on december 11th.  The offer however was just an email congratulating me for passing the last interview and asking me for the date I'd like to start (maximum was january 6th) so they could put it in the contract, I emailed on the same day of the congratulatory email stating I can make it for the 30th of December. One week later and no contract was sent, and the tickets were getting increasingly expensive due to holiday season.

Although it's been sort of in the back of my head that this could be a scam (it was all very easy, but they also needed someone with my background desperately), they all had @company name, had full linkedin profiles with profile picture and everything, the skype interview matched their linkedin faces, and the company has its own website, linkedin profile, linkedin submissions and articles, so I'm sure it's all legitimate. However I still got uneasy given how sudden I needed to move out to work and how easy the interview process was so I have emailed them earlier today, and they confirmed they'd need me there on January 6th, and supposedly they were meant to have attached the offer letter in the email for me to sign and didn't do that, so I sent them another email asking for it in case they had forgotten.

I'm sorry if it seems a bit confusing, but this process has been all over the place. Rushed and at the same time slow and I don't know if I should just be waiting for them or if it's OK to email them for these inquiries.

1216,d611ow,False,Onboarding,14,Question about Background Check,jobs,"So my new employer has actually hired me (I signed the contracts and everything and today is my second day on the job). For reference, I’m at a consulting company and yet to go on site to a client.

However they have not yet completed the background check and I just filled out the employment and education verification consent forms today.

I’m wondering, do they check primarily to validate the information I presented on my resume, or do they scour for all traces of me? The post secondary I listed on my resume is correct and I do have a proper degree from there. And I have worked in a job relevant to my current one for 2 years after that (I don’t remember if I disclosed my full education for that check, or if they even asked for full education verification in that check)

However, I have a post secondary school that I didn’t finish from which is not listed in my resume (disciplinary expulsion back in 2013 when I was a dumb kid, but no criminal record from it) and I didn’t list it on the background check forms. Will that turn up on a search? If someone were to actually look at the years, there is a gap between my secondary and most recent post secondary, but I’m wondering if the check is conducted based on all public and voluntarily submitted information. 

And if I were to have disclosed it, would a check be able to uncover the reason behind my leaving?

1221,dl8w6x,False,Onboarding,6,Unsure if I should stay at this job?,jobs,"I have been with my current company for around 19 months. For the first 18 months (also my first job after graduate school), I worked in a challenging environment that gradually became more toxic, as time passed, due to low pay, issues not being resolved from administrators, numerous staff quitting due to burnout and never-ending staff shortages, ethical concerns, etc. I requested to transfer to a different department 2 months ago into a slightly different role (for slightly higher pay) and more growth opportunities. I knew other people who had left my former department to transfer to my current department, and they had positive experiences when changing, and I hoped I would have the same.

I have been at my new job for 3 weeks, and given the 3 varied roles within my position, I have one ""main"" supervisor, but also 3 ""additional"" supervisors for each of my roles. I thought this would be a ""good"" thing to have different insight and mentorship; however, it has frequently resulted in miscommunication among the 4 supervisors when advising me for what to do for the varied roles within my positions, as well as figuring out who is responsible to ""train"" me for different roles. I am frequently told how to complete a task from one of these supervisors, but then having my ""main"" supervisor become frustrated with the differences in information being shared with me. I only see my ""main"" supervisor 1-2 time(s) a week, so on the days I do not see her, I have to e-mail her, and hope I am given a response that way. There are also times that my supervisors have not communicated necessary training information to me because they believe that another supervisor has already told me the necessary information and/or due to assuming I transferred within the company, I should already know the information (which is not possible due to differences in the departments). When I interviewed for this new position, the directors were aware of my limited experience related to some aspects of this new job, but felt confident that I could learn on the job and with experience, which I hoped also. The department has never hired someone into so many different positions like what they made my position to be, and say they are learning, as they go, with how to best supervise me, but it's feeling very frustrated.

I feel that all of these different supervisors are now realizing the impacts of the miscommunication during my training process, and have been asking me how ""training"" has been going, and are not very happy with the results. They are expecting me to independently complete my job responsibilities starting within the next 2 weeks. They have been having me shadow one of my supervisors 2-3 days a week to watch how they complete their specified job responsibilities, which has definitely been insightful to watch; however, with all of the time spent observing, they have given me very minimal on the job training related to my workload for one of these components, which is very different than my supervisor's.

Today, one of the supervisors spoke with me privately (and mentioned she would be speaking with my other supervisors to see how everything has been going, etc) to ask how training has been going, etc, to which she questioned me if I felt ""ready"" to independently complete some other aspects of my job due to my limited experience with some areas of the position, and also mentioned that if she had interviewed me, she would have highlighted other pertinent information related to the job to have a better depiction of the job, etc. I felt that she also implied that she does not feel I am the best fit for this position, as I said I was interested in taking this position to gain more experience in different areas, but told me that was not the purpose of this position, and that I needed to view myself as more of an ""expert"" to succeed in the position. However, with only 3 weeks at this new job, and most of my time spent in ""training"" by watching other people do their job, and not being given direct support with my own workload, I am definitely feeling overwhelmed and not confident in my abilities, and feel like the department now regrets hiring me, although I know I did not misrepresent my credentials, etc. It seems like this new department is almost just like my previous department, disappointingly, with a toxic and unsupportive environment again. Another supervisor also mentioned to me that she was not used to having new hires to the department with such limited experience either, which again is making me question why I was hired.

Additionally, I am scheduled to work at 2 different locations, but do not have adequate resources to complete my job, as at one of my locations, I temporarily have no office, desk, or computer to use due to building renovations for a few weeks, and at my other location, I have no desk to store any pertinent files, and have to borrow one of my supervisor's filing cabinet to file important documents.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do with this situation? I was really looking forward to new experiences at this job, but between the inconsistent training/supervisor, lack of appropriate resources at my job, continuing miscommunications, etc, I am feeling really inadequate and disappointed with this new position, and am unsure if things will work out, if I should just quit already, etc?

coming into this position, i had to acclimate not only to a new way of doing things i mostly knew how to do, but to the fact that my position in this large company is more on the data analysis end than the customer service side of the position i excelled in before. they use abbreviations i’ve never heard of, hundreds of custom reports i didn’t even have need for until now. i liked to think i was doing a fairly good job getting used to things, but as the days go by i’m not sure. it has not been easy, but i’ve taken the initiative to take detailed notes, look them over in my spare time, ask questions. 

nobody is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, and these things would be alright if it weren’t for the way i get treated when i make a small mistake. one of my supervisors has a consistently nasty attitude with me when i ask a question or need clarification, and my coworkers aren’t always available to assist me (ETA: there are only five of us in my department total, so who i can go to is limited). my supervisor is easily irritated with me despite the fact that i’ve had no negative interactions with them. 

there have been several instances where another coworker showed me how to perform a task and left out some more minor information that i did not know i needed until my manager brought it to my attention (ie- i didn’t get the updated contact list for a project, i wasn’t told which report to pull/i was told to use an outdated report, etc). 

i get new tasks and information thrown at me on a daily basis; i take extensive notes and ask questions when i have them, but i don’t understand how i can take notes on information i’m not given in the first place. i’m still fairly new and it’s only been a month, so until i’m more familiar with the reports and the way they like things done, i can really only do things the way that i’ve been told to do them. 

we have a ""best practices"" manual but it's outdated. i'm told to look there if i have questions, but either the thing i'm looking for isn't there, or the procedure is obsolete and i get reprimanded for using the old instructions.

i could understand if it was a large, more crucial mistake that affected the outcome of a project or impacted company-wide data, but it’s not. the numbers are correct. the format is correct. the work is carefully done. in almost every instance thus far, it’s been that i have sent an email to the wrong group of people or had too many people on the receiving end of an email due to the aforementioned contact list/lack thereof, or even once where i sent an email from my own email address rather than the email address for generic reports. this is not sensitive information. the entire company can access the reports i send out at any given time as they’re stored on a shared drive, so it’s not like i’m leaking secrets to the wrong department or anything like that. 

the worst thing i have done thus far was that a formula did not get updated in a spreadsheet, and i didn't catch it. we have other coworkers look over reports before we send them out for this exact reason. the coworker who looked it over said it was great and that everything was set to send it out. however, when someone from another department saw that the number in question had not updated correctly, i was solely the one at fault in my supervisor's eyes. i did make the initial mistake by overlooking it, and i apologized and made a note to be sure i check that every time from here on out, but i don't feel that i'm the only one who should be singled out when that's the exact reason we all check each other's work.

to top it all off, i’ve tried making friends but nothing has stuck. i’ve been on a few lunches with people i’ve chatted to and taken the steps to invite my coworkers out to lunch with me as well, but nothing comes of it other than acknowledging each other in the hallway or saying a polite “good morning”. nobody i’ve been to lunch with has responded to my invitations to go to lunch again. i’ve never had problems talking to people or even making solid friendly acquaintanceships, and i had a lot of friends at my previous jobs, but i feel like i have no support system here, or even anyone who likes me enough to talk to me more than once or twice. 

i am beyond frustrated. i feel exhausted and worn-down. i feel isolated, stupid, embarrassed constantly. i take the criticism with a smile and an “i’ll make note of that, thank you!”. i do make note of it, and while i haven’t repeated a mistake, i keep making minor mistakes of the same type. i don’t mind criticism, but when it seems like i’m getting picked at for every little thing i do wrong, it starts to dishearten me. i picked up my last position so quickly, and i had high hopes that experience would be of more help to me here than it has been. 

i don’t know what to do. i cant quit. i don’t WANT to quit. i just want to be better. if anything, i want to stay as long as possible and prove that i can do it. i'm afraid they'll get fed up and fire me, but i have no way of knowing how they feel about my performance. my actual boss hasn't said anything negative to me, but he isn't the one i'm concerned about.

sorry if this is all over the place, i just need to get it out. does anyone have advice? have you been in a similar situation? i need some guidance. i don't want to quit, i just want to know how to cope until i get more into the swing of things here",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d8phab/im_miserable_at_my_dream_job/,0,This is my life right now man.

I've accepted a graduate job offer at Deloitte UK that starts early September. However, due to UK visa complications I will almost certainly miss the first 2-4 weeks which forms part of their 6 weeks induction/training.

My question is, how likely is Deloitte to withdraw the job offer because of my missing the initial training/ starting late?

Also, I will receive my full contract next week, should I sign it straight away to make it less appealing for them to rescind or hold off signing it until they confirm they're happy for me to start late and change the start date on the contract?

I'm not a US citizen (I'm coming from Europe, this will be my first job in the US) and the notification period for leaving a job can be 1 to 3 months, so switching jobs typically does not take place under a month.

Which I had no idea since I was naive to the workforce and didn’t realise until about a year in. I spent 1.5 years there before I left. 

Now I’m in this new job, but feel like I have a really unhealthy mindset about how corporate jobs are. My last job we were basically glued to our office and had to make mgmt aware if we needed to leave for work related reasons. My old job required a lot of offsite meetings, lunches, getting out to stores, etc that it was very common to be in and out of the office for the day. Yet, every time we needed to leave even if just 15 minutes we needed to let our manager know. We couldn’t just put it on our calendar, which our managers had full access to and could see, we had to get verbal/written confirmation that we were leaving. We also had to let our manager know whenever we were changing our hours and had to stick to that schedule until we said we were changing again. It couldn’t be a work 7-4 one day and 8-5 the next. Often leadership would walk around the halls and check in and see who wasn’t in their office. If you weren’t there, they would ask your manager were you were. Working through lunch and staying late were also common and expected. 

I’m in this new role at a new large company with about 400 employees, my last one had 47. I can’t help but fear people are watching my every move. I feel like I need to get permission from my manager to have a flex day and often staying over my 8 hours to make sure they know I’m doing my hours. I’m scared to be on my phone and scared to leave my cubicle (my manager sits diagonal from me) because im worried they are wondering what I’m doing and if I’m gone for an extended time (like ten minutes) that I need to add those to my total hours worked and stay later. It doesn’t seem like that’s the culture here, but it’s only been 3 weeks and I’m still doing it to be safe.

So it also says that scrubs are acceptable but I want to make a good impression and feel I shouldn't go this route because:

1. My job is in a office setting so I really wouldn't need scrubs and so it would feel weird to wear this as a first impression for orientation.

Welcome to working with largely incompetent management and people who are happy to get a pay cheque for doing not very much all day.

If you actually do anything all it does is create problems, because their whole enviroment is a non-functional unproductive problem. 

The fact you are actually trying to do something in an efficient manner is odd to them.

I would discuss it with your own company, in a format of a time line of events, as at some point it will probably come back on you why you haven't got anything done, and having a chain of written documentation through email will be essential, ""having a chat"" won't stand up for anything in this situation it needs to be written documentation. Also updating them before hand on the situation will be useful saying that delays may occur due to prexisting projects taking priority (or whatever corporate BS you can come up with that isn't, ""no one is getting off their ass and doing any work""). 

I would see if you can get a list of outcomes that your clients senior management wants from your company, and has been sent to your company. Then work on implementing that, or if no one in that office can be bothered, sending the right emails to the right people, that would implement it if they could be bothered, to show that they had been asked to move forward but didn't respond with any actions.

I filled out the on-boarding paperwork about 10 minutes after receiving the e-mail the day after I was interviewed. Then I waited for a phone call. 

I called the next Monday and talked to someone and told them I had filled out the paperwork. Was again told that it would take a few days. OK, whatever.

Currently working full-time as a security guard, making just over Min. Wage. Current loans: $50,000 debt ($25k student loans, $25k vehicle loan). Can barely make ends meet.

I've been applying to jobs in my ""field"" since being out of school, 4 years ago. I've been to about 8 interviews within that time and have only been able to lockdown low-paying jobs. I worked as a Youth Care Worker 2 years ago right after school, but the stress was not worth the minimal pay (~$2/hr over min. wage). Unsure where my interviews have been going wrong. I've had a couple opportunities, and have somehow screwed them up. I believe my time is worth more than win. wage, and I'm a fairly competent worker. I have decided to stay at current security job for the experience, and believe it's good to stay at 1 job longer and wait for the right position. 

I applied to a large city in Canada for their open position of 911 Operator. Apparently they are hiring 20-40 people and pays $33/hr. This would be a lifechanger for me, and has now become a dream to lock this down. They responded back to my application through email with an online questionnaire about basic information regarding the job to ensure I was interested. I passed onto the next level and have set up a time to go to their HQ for a 2-hour testing segment, which includes: ""short term memory, typing, spelling, sentence clarity and reading comprehension.

1254,dka9h1,False,Onboarding,1,Recently started a job in a newly-created role. I've been getting minimal guidance or training and I'm not sure what to do.,jobs,"Context: as in the title, I've recently started a new job in a role that was newly created within an established, ~100 person software company. Basically, the plan was to hire someone full time to do a particular job that one team (team A) had a rotation for, and wanted to stop doing since it's out of the scope of their own roles. The people in team A work mostly remotely, and it's them who are my ""customers"" (and who I work with the most so far). However, I'm organizationally a member of a different team (team B) whose manager I report to. It's a weird structure and I got a sense of the weirdness during the interview process when the hiring manager (the manager of team A) revealed I would be reporting to someone else.

While it makes sense for me to be a part of team B given the set of tools and technologies I'm working with, since joining I've had almost no official training with either of the teams. My current training has consisted of shadowing members of team A as they do the job I've been hired to do, though this is proving difficult as they are all remote and keep doing parts of the job without me. I've also had very little official contact with either of the managers. At other companies I've worked for, I'm used to having weekly one-on-one check-ins with my managers (and sometimes daily check ins during onboarding), and after four weeks on the job, I haven't had a single one. Manager of team B (my manager) has assigned me some projects, which is fine, but they're all relatively advanced and have little to do with the job I was actually hired for (I also haven't been getting much help on them). As time goes on I do want to spend more time on these kinds of projects, but for now I first want to establish myself in the job I was hired to do. 

Truth be told, I'm starting to get worried. I'm still not sure how I should be spending my time, how long training should take, and how to get the training I need. I'm also relatively isolated since my primary customers are remote. It's clear to me now that little thought was given to this role's day to day, and there was (and is) little coordination between the leaders of the two teams regarding this role. I'm imagining it was basically team A saying ""there's this job we don't like and we want someone else on team B to do it for us"", and team B saying ""sure, we'd be glad to have another person"". I'm also totally unclear on how I'm going to be evaluated. Will I be reviewed by team A or B? What should my goals be? When should I expect to be ramped? How should I learn what I need to know? Who do I need to please?

I've been trying my best to manage in this unorganized situation, but as of right now it does not seem sustainable and I need clarity from my manager. Unfortunately he's definitely hands off, and while not a bad guy, mentoring does not appear to be a strongpoint of his. What do you recommend I do in this situation to get the guidance and clarity that I need?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dka9h1/recently_started_a_job_in_a_newlycreated_role_ive/,1,"First prioritize your projects, then write down a list of questions for each.  I assume you know how to do some of what you’re being asked or they wouldn’t have hired you.  Go to the person who assigned a given project and let them know you’re of course still learning the workflow but wanted to walk them through what you think the steps should be.  If Team A member jumps ahead and does something without you, ask them how they did it, say hey I would really love to take this part off your hands can you show me your process or here’s what I think your process was, does this work.  There are two types of people in your situation, those who quit because they dont know what to do and think there’s no training and those who figure out how to fill the holes, figure out how to slowly help each member of team A or  team B.  A lot of times companies have a group of employees that says they are really struggling to get something done and so they hire someone to do it, you, so if they won’t show you how to do it, try a few things, show them a few things, show your manager a few things, don’t ask or wait, just do.  The brilliance of a job like yours that isn’t standardized is you could make it what you want and then be the person everyone wants to go to and that person climbs quickly.

1262,dc0u0z,False,Onboarding,1,My boss is a lunatic - she’s been contracting herself every other day.,jobs,"LAST WEEKS POST: 

My boss gave me a shitty 30 day review due to things not being the way she wants them... she never once sat down to train me to do anything. Not entirely sure how to handle it moving forward.

I work for the public defenders office and began July 29th, two weeks after I went on vacation for two weeks (this was known at my time of hire), I also had a few orientation days. So at best, I’ve worked 36 full days.  The county requires 6 months probation for everyone. 

I was hired because of having knowledge and experience with the programs they use. I have NO knowledge of their procedures. I’ve essentially been fed to the wolves and I’ve been figuring things out on my own. 

Not one thing has been said to me by anyone on job performance. My boss (who I’m writing this post about) has complemented my intelligence and as of last week assigned me more work to do. When she assigned me this work, her and I had a meeting about how I felt about taking on another workload. NOT ONCE did she talk about my performance or work. 

Today, she asked if I had time to talk, I said sure. She then proceeds to tell me that she needs to see improvement across the board and began listing things I’ve done wrong. Then proceeds to tell me, “you know you’re still on probation right?” Needless to say, I was taken back, a lot. 

1. Never was a single thing said to me about my work for the past 30+ days. 
2. She never sat down with me ONCE to show me how to do anything or explain how their office procedure works. My thing is, how dare you say anything with YOU have yet to do a single thing with me and tell me it’s not how SHE wants it done?! 
3. She blamed my poor job performance on not following the sheets provided (which happen to be vaguely written “instructions”).  

Things she didn’t like: 
- How I close my files (the office wants it done a specific way) 
- One my spreadsheets were not being saved on the department drive, only my desktop. I thought it was being shared with everyone. No one said anything about not being able to see it!!! 
- How I type my transcripts for hearings. Apparently there’s a way that she wants that done as well. 

UPDATE TO LAST WEEK: 

I sat down with her the following day and she contradicted everything she said. She told me she didn’t expect me to learn everything in one day and she didn’t want me to get discouraged. We ended on a positive note. 

THIS WEEK: 

The end of last week and beginning of this week, I’ve been making it a point to go to her with questions and pointing out that I used her technique while doing this or that. Sometimes I’m just saying it even when I know what I’m doing so she knows I took it all seriously. 

Today, she randomly pulls me from my desk and says do you have a minute? I went into a conference room with her and the supervisor directly under her. She went on to tell me she’s going to do my two month review. She then noted that it’s about 2.5 weeks early because I had a scheduled vacation right after I started which she knew about before hiring me. 

The meeting essentially didn’t give me any feedback. She just asked me how I like it and how I get along with coworkers. I said nothing but positive things. She then goes on to tell me, “I think you’re too confident”. I must’ve given her a look of wtf and she said no, I really do. Zero explanation furthering that. 

We ended the meeting, there was nothing signed by me nor was anything provided for me to sign. She actually wrote nothing down during this meeting. 

I really think my job is in jeopardy here and I’m very nervous. I do what she tells me and it’s wrong, I don’t do what she tells me I’m wrong. I really don’t know what to do.

&#x200B;

I got an offer from a mortgage company and in order to finish the onboarding process, I need to submit a drug test.

Here's the thing. I am not a smoker and I do not regularly smoke weed. I just sipped once from my friend's weed vape pen two days ago and I got an offer letter the next day.

Will I fail the drug test? I was doing some research and it said substance will be in your system for a week (urine). I'm not sure if that applies to the non-smoker.

Trouble is, I don’t actually know the literal job description.

I applied for the position in November, and got a call last month to come in and talk with a hiring manager. To prep I tried looking at the job posting, but they yanked it off of indeed before they arranged for me to come in. I tried everything I could think of: looking at reviews from old employees, looking at my application on their website, trying to find similar postings, and I got nada. I went in expecting to do horribly but it went great! Talked about salary, the guy showed me some projects he’s working on, and he basically told me I was a front runner right then and there.

I recently accepted an offer of employment to work for a new org and am very excited to start my work. When I applied for the job, I did not include the graduate coursework that I've completed on my resume (I'm enrolled part-time in a grad program but do not yet have a degree). My reasons for leaving this coursework off were a) I don't have the degree yet, b) I wanted to keep my resume concise and focused on the job at hand (I have in the past been routinely guilty of including a lot of irrelevant info on my resume for the sake of ""painting a complete portrait of myself""), and c) while the degree is applicable in the general field I'm working in it doesn't really have much bearing on the job I've been hired for. 

At no point in the hiring process was there an opportunity to bring it up, because again, the degree has no relevance to the particular job I was hired for. The intent was simply to not take credit for something I haven't earned yet, because until I finish my coursework, as far as I'm concerned it's just continuing education. 

I don't anticipate the class I have scheduled this fall to interfere with my work at all (I've been working f/t and studying p/t for a while now and it's always been fine), and won't be requesting professional development funds for my class as it doesn't have bearing on my job (I already paid off the course and plan on using my PD money for job-related tasks).

I will be starting at company A next week. Lo and behold, I received an interview from company B, which I applied for during my job hunting period.  After interview and checking my references and background company B called me earlier this week and said they approved my position and verbally asked if I would accept. This is my dream government position and so I accepted and my start date is in mid September. Because it is government, it took them a while to go through my background check before they can approve me. I am still waiting for my offer letter, and the manager said to wait until next week. 

My dilemma is that I have not received an official offer letter from company B and so I feel like it’s not official yet and nothing is set in stone. However, given by how the manager communicated very thoroughly through every step of the application process and actually set a start date for me, I am pretty sure it’s official they are just waiting for their HR just as much as I am. 

I have not told company A that I will not be starting yet. On one hand, I would hate to start with company A for the few days then quit for company B. I don’t want to burn bridges. On the other hand, if I quit company A before I start just based on the fact that company B will extend an offer letter to me, and there is that small possibility the offer does not go through, I would end up with no jobs.

That one is fair. It's better to have a no foul language rule and not enforce it, than not have a rule and then have to deal with foul-mouthed staff offending customers and arguing that it's their right since it's not in the handbook. Not to mention it can be off-putting and uncomfortable for some other employees, especially if it's mostly men being foul about sex, or vice versa.

If they are saying you can't drink ever, that's unreasonable. I wouldn't work somewhere that dictated how I live when I'm off the clock. If they're saying you can't drink at that restaurant ever, or you can't drink in uniform, that's a pretty common policy. ",2019-07-24 18:50:46

I was recently offered a job in a public school district; and as a teacher who was hired into a public district, your salary is based on your experience. In my situation, it's specifically based on the number of ""contracted years of service"" you have.   


I went in today to sign my contract and on the contract it had my salary, as well as my specific ""step"" on the salary schedule that matched my experience. Only, it didn't actually match my experience. It was 2 years short. For some that may not be a big deal, but in this case it was a $4000+ difference in salary. The district I was being hired into did not count my previous time as a ""student support specialist"" at a private school as actual ""teaching experience."" Luckily, I had been through this once before and was wise enough to have my contract from that job on hand.   


I said to the HR person that my experience on the contract didn't match my actual experience. They said, ""Yeah, when you were a 'student support specialist,' we weren't sure if that was a contracted teaching position or not."" I replied with, ""It actually was a contracted teaching position and luckily, I have my contract from that position with me today.""

So if you're going for a teaching position (or any position that bases your salary off of your years of service), bring your previous contracts.

Started a new job recently. It's working for a community action group (don't want to say the name, its a small-ish company)

So, the job includes door knocking on high rise, generally low income apartment buildings to talk to residents, which is fine. 

However I was led to believe that this was being done in pairs (it is not)

So for 5 hours a day, I'm alone and being explicitly told my first goal is to 'Get in the Door' of strangers apartments (with quotas). Am I right to be concerned about safety, particularly as a woman? 

I was told there was alot of training, but after about two hours of some situational bits yesterday, I started door knocking, alone. 

Other 'yellow flags' include:

-There is no contract, or clear definition of the role. 

-Pay is ambiguous ""it's salaried, works out to 15 an hour"" but I haven't seen that in writing anywhere, and 32k-something works out to under 15 an hour (what they pay part time workers) 

- I'm worried about the cops being called on me for soliciting in a building. We don't have permission to be in there, and are instructed to just follow a resident when they open the main door. I asked the main organizer if they had ever been arrested or had the the cops called on him while doing the job, and the question wasn't answered. (Particularly anyone with Ontario Law knowledge know the answer to this one?)

- I would learn to deal with this one, but basically the hours are different than advertised. 12-9pm, with some weekends. (I have a much better paying weekend job, with a contract) 

-It is a preformance based job with quotas. (Re they can fire me if I don't meet those quotas) I have worked with quotas before. But I've know what was expected and what was the threshold I needed to meet. That's not the case here, after asking multiple times. 

-Women who work mobile jobs- how do you use the bathroom, or change tampons? These buildings aren't always around a coffee shop or Macdonald, and we aren't technically allowed to leave the building incase we can't get back in. 

Really I'm thankful to have something full-time after 4 months of apply and just scrapping by on other gigs, but the above really worry me.

Super not cool that you are having to do something where you aren't even allowed to be in there. Residents are probably even instructed not to let random strangers in, you might even get them in trouble. And since the organizer didn't answer your question, the answer is likely yes, at least with having the cops called. I don't know what the law is, but you may even be breaking trespassing laws considering you are sneaking in behind residents. And then if you are charged with that, then you have that to possibly deal with when you are applying to another job. 

I know how much it sucks to go that long without a job, but that's how absolutely awful jobs that might not even be doing legal things rope people in. This one is playing games with you and you may get into legal trouble. At least look up about trespassing if you really do not want to quit that badly.  ",2019-02-08 13:13:16

1308,afy8ig,False,Onboarding,8,Ideal Job Getting Pushy,jobs,"I've been with my incumbent role (Company A) for close to four years.  We were acquired a couple of years ago, and some functions have been integrated, resulting in layoffs in my company.  Because I've been the last person left in my group for well over two years, I figured it was a matter of time.  Just before the holiday, I received an offer (Company B) with a signing bonus (20% of base) and submitted the due diligence paperwork a couple of days before Christmas.

We come back from the holidays, and sure enough that first Friday, I was advised my position was going away at the end of February.  Because my responsibilities were being split six ways, there was a sizable transition bonus to stay aboard through the end of February on top of severance.  Between reviewing the agreements with the attorney last week and making a transition plan, I hadn't had a chance to follow up with Company B on their status.  Of note, Company A is willing to pay out the retention bonus in full if I get things transitioned out this month.

This past Friday, I get an email from the internal recruiter at Company B, wishing me luck on my first day Monday (today).  Of course, this was news to me.  It appears that someone on the Company B onboarding team dropped the ball and never circled back with me on the start date, where to show up, et al.  

They then wanted to make a first day the 21st (which they neglected to see was a holiday), which makes for a short-notice resignation.  I've pushed back for a 28th start date, which lets me give a two-week notice today, get things properly transitioned out and retain eligibility for that transition bonus.

As of this morning, Company B is still insistent on getting started next week, because they've aligned me with a project.  I'm of the opinion that their internal fuck-ups are not my problem, but also don't want to burn a bridge here and risk losing at least one of the two bonuses.

Any thoughts/feedback would be great.

We've already had three job openings at reddit this past year, including this one for [sales support position posted today](http://redd.it/1wwfgi). We've had great success finding awesome candidates in /r/ForHire and relevant local subreddits, but we're seeing some common mistakes over and over again. I thought I'd share some of the most common ones we've seen in the thousand or so applications we've triaged this year.  

Hope these tips are helpful in your search.  Will answer any questions in the comments:

* Name your damn files. If you are attaching or uploading files (resume/cover letter/etc) put your name in filename. I now have 200 files on my computer called resume.doc, and a bunch with even worse labels like summer_2013_webjobs_resume.pdf.  

* Don't apply for a full time job while you are in high school or college unless you have a really good reason. Appreciate the confidence, but you're most likely wasting both of our time.  

* If you have non-traditional experience that you feel would help you do the job you're applying for, that's excellent, but it's up to you to explain how the experience would relate. Don't assume people will understand jargon from a different industry in your resume no matter how impressive. Make your case in the cover letter and resume itself. have a friend who is not in the industry read over it and make sure they understand any jargon etc.        

* Showing a sense of humor can be great in the right context, but if you have any doubts, err on the side of caution. A bad joke can be a deal killer.  

* Speak directly to the job description being offered. It's often clear from the resume and cover letter that applicants didn't really read the job description. Are you right for this particular job, or are you just interested in the company, location, etc.?  

* Don't talk about how you really wanted to be a film director, game designer, zoo keeper, etc but just couldn't cut it (unless there was like a career ending injury or something else outside your control). Everyone can relate, but it's not really your best look.  

* Spelling and grammar matter. You don't have to be 100% perfect, but sloppiness is a killer.  

* Even if the job is open to relocation, local candidates will most likely be favored. If you are not local, be convincing about how relocating won't be an issue.   

* Get someone to look over your resume and anything else in your application. A second opinion is always a good idea.  

* If there are truly optional fields, you should have a good reason to skip. Why pass up a chance to make your case?  

* If you are not applying for an hourly job, don't include what you made hourly for past positions on your resume.

1329,21tykx,False,[advice],196,Why your job search isn't working,jobs,"As a recruiter who stumbled upon this subreddit a month or so ago, I have seen a lot of the same issues come up time and time again that lead people to unsuccessful job searches. I wanted to share the biggest items, and some suggestions for those who have been perpetually searching for awhile to see if some of these problems could be solved, and everyone can land their next job. Job searching is such a mentally, physically, and emotionally draining experience. Your livelihood is at stake, and it's really easy to shut down after awhile.

**Problem #1: Lack of networking, resume blasting**

I often see posts with ""I have sent 100, 200, 500, 1000, etc., resumes and have had no luck so far!"" Part of this has to do with a sense of entitlement. People have degrees and work experience, and by sending a resume, if they are vaguely qualified (or feel they are) for a position, they feel everything should fall into place. 

Most positions I recruit for garner 50-200 applications for one opening. Honestly, after removing the under-qualified people, most resumes tend to look the same. A few will stand out, but a majority are at about the same experience and skill level. Most recruiters juggle 15-20 open positions at a time. It is impossible, and inefficient to interview all of them, beyond the ones that really stick out. So what do we do in situations like that? We look at our own network, and for referrals.

Say you have a high performing employee that comes to you with a great candidate for one of your open positions. You trust them since they are the ideal employee. Recruiting is all about trying to remove as much uncertainty about candidates as possible. If they vouch for this person, chances are they are just as good, if not better. I almost always will give referrals at least a phone interview, even if they may be a bit underqualified from an education/experience standpoint. Why? Because if they get the respect of a current, high performing employee, they probably have the drive to work hard for any gaps they may have. I'll take those top few resumes, plus referrals, and interview those individuals. This means if you don't stick out beyond the typical person, or know someone within the organization, you are already way behind.

What's the takeaway? Make sure your resume is top-notch. Get HR professionals, and those working in your field to review your resume constantly. Make sure you tailor your resume to each position you apply for. Stop blasting resumes and find positions that you want the most and focus on those. If you're sending 500 resumes, you obviously don't want a specific position with a specific company, you just want a job. That often shows through. Network constantly within and outside of your organization. Remember, networking isn't about looking for something, it's about spending time and essentially creating a friendship. Use your company, past companies, professional organizations, HR professionals, and company executives as the best place to start. LinkedIn helps a lot. See if you have a connection at the company with an open position, and reach out to them.

**Problem 2: ""I get interviews, but never hear back""**

If you get interviews, but never get beyond the first round, this tells you two things. One, your resume is good enough to get you an interview. Celebrate and recognize that. Second, your interviewing skills are obviously lacking. Ask HR professionals or managers within your field to help you with a mock interview. Bring them the job description, and they can ask questions that will closely match what you can expect for a certain position. Find someone that will be brutally honest, and be open to their criticisms. Work on your responses and mindset, and continue until you receive mostly positive feedback. 

Good recruiters should give you a deadline of when you can expect to hear back. If they don't, be sure to ask at the end of the interview. If it's been 24 hours after you were told you would hear back, an e-mail or call is appropriate. Be proactive, and don't wait on a company. The golden rule of job hunting is to work like you don't have anything in the works until you have an offer in your hands. If a company isn't getting back to you after multiple attempts, it may not be the type of place you want to work. 

**Problem 3: Poor understanding of recruitment process**

There is a lot of bad advice across places like this subreddit, the blogosphere, and the web in general. When reading articles offering advice, make sure it is from someone who has interviewed people over a long period of time, and/or was in a position to give offers and make hiring decisions. While advice from those who have recently had a successful search can be helpful, keep in mind every position, company, and location looks for different things. Don't overthink things. There's no magic set of actions or words you can use to get a job. It ALWAYS comes down to who meets the qualifications, who has preferred qualities that we are looking for, and who is the best cultural fit for the company. 

Speaking of qualifications, a lot of people are saying apply to everything, even if you're not qualified. Most of the time this is poor advice. I never put required experience on a job posting that isn't necessary for the position. Most companies post required and preferred experience. Required means just that, you need these skills, experiences, and education requirements to successfully perform well in the role. It isn't something we guess, there is a lot of thought and research done before posting an opening. There may be minor areas that companies are willing to forgive if you have a really strong preferred skill, but no manager I work with is going to invest in someone under qualified. Remember volunteer experience, or even some duties for a non-related position can count as experience if you can show how it gained that skill that they are looking for. It doesn't always need to be for pay.

The best thing to do is to put yourself in the recruiter's shoes. Look at the job description. If you needed to hire this person, where would you look? What type of person would you look for? What would you want to see on a resume? You need to emulate that person. Know the company, know the job, provide examples of how your experiences meet those qualifications. 

**Problem 4: Letting failure bring you down**

Rejection is hard. When you get that letter, ""we are pursuing other candidates at this time,"" it is hard to deal with. Being told you're not good enough is hard. Or is it? When we send rejection e-mails out, it does not always mean you weren't qualified. Remember we receive hundreds of applications for 1 open position. To say only 1 person could do the job out of 100-200 would be a lie. The only issue is that we have to choose only one person for the opening. Use this as an opportunity by saying, ""Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your organization, and I thank you for your consideration. Your company is one I greatly respect, and would love to work for someday. I hope you will keep me in mind for future opportunities with your company!"" Keep in mind that sometimes you aren't qualified. But if you've had a few interviews, and someone else is chosen, it is likely that someone was just a little bit better in some way, or had some preferred skill that you may not have. Using it as a networking opportunity can help you down the road if you have left a positive impression. 

After 6 months to a year of no luck, it can take a huge toll on you. Speak with someone that you can vent with. Seek professional help if needed. Keep yourself healthy. It will be hard to come off positively in an interview if you are too pessimistic and depressed. Make sure you are okay with you, so you can present the best version of yourself.



And most importantly, best of luck! Always be prepared to know what you would do tomorrow if you lost your job today. Hopefully this helps some of you, I'll answer any questions you have. Sorry for the length!




**TL;DR:** A lot of weird advice exists here and all over the internet. Take with a grain of salt. Put yourself in a recruiter's shoes when looking, and emulate the person you would look for if you needed to fill the position. Network, network, network. Be proactive and don't wait on anyone or anything, keep moving forward. Accurately assess your successes and gaps, and fix gaps to improve your chances. Don't do it alone, utilize the many resources out there at your disposal.

**Final Edit:** Thank you to everyone who was open minded and participated in a respectful manner. It's too bad that those trying to help receive treatment like this due to a job title and a misunderstanding of their field. Due to the overwhelming amount of negativity going on in this thread, I am going to ask that if you have serious questions regarding your job search, that you send them via PM, and I will do my best to respond timely.  

I get that a lot of people out there are frustrated due to the state of the job market. If it is therapeutic for those unfairly being unemployed so long to take their frustrations out on recruiters, so be it. I am glad this post can at least provide that. Please remember while job hunting is draining and difficult, blaming others, or the system, isn't going to provide job offers. Please keep that goal in mind, and focus your energy on steps to help you find the next step in your career.

For each negative comment, there were also many engaging, helpful questions asked by participants. Thank you for those, and I hope this post can provide some ideas to change things up to generate new leads for your job hunt.

1330,37iu1q,False,[advice],64,Knowing When To Quit Your Job,jobs,"I felt it was appropriate to share some guidelines to consider when you feel it's time to leave your job and start over. This list is a combination of my personal experience and articles I've read in making my decision to leave. When we're so comfortable in a job that we've been at for a few years, it is sometimes easy to be deceived that we're in a ""good place"". Just like any bad relationship, it's hard to break up when you're comfortable.

A quick background of my career history - I was a paralegal for a few years looking to change law firms due to boredom and unhappiness. Was offered a non-legal position through a temp agency for a job I did not apply for, but this new position resulted in a  free ride to law school and an entryway to an attorney position with the business. Would've never had this opportunity if I didn't take the leap of faith to quit.

**1) Quit your job if you're more often bored/dissatisfied with your days at work** 
Regardless of how happy you are at your job, we all have bad days. However, if it gets to a point where the bad days outweigh the good and you start dreading going to work because you can foresee a bad day, then it's time to reconsider your job.

I used to find myself throwing tantrums on Sunday evenings because I could not stand the thought of going to work on Monday. 

**2) Quit your job if you're underpaid**
My husband used to always ask me why I was settling for only $11/hour for a paralegal position. I used to continuously tell him that it was a good place to be and I was learning new things. His rebuttal was simply, ""How do you know other places can't offer the same but for more money?"" Essentially, he was right. How can you really say your position is ""good"" if you haven't seen what else is out there. I now make nearly triple the amount I used to and it is definitely a better place to work and it is definitely a job I keep learning in. I would have never known about this position if I didn't step out of my comfort zone.

**3) Quit your job if you're being verbally abused by your boss** 
When we're too comfortable in our position, it's as if office etiquette flies out the door because coworkers start feeling like family. Regardless how close your peers become, the office is still the office. My previous boss used to cuss up a storm and emotionally abuse us when our working performance was not up to par. I truly believed this was just how a typical law office was like and any ""good"" company would push their employees in the same fashion. Wrong! I now work in a Fortune 500 company and no one would dare treat their employees like such.  

**4) Don't be afraid of the unknown** 
What if I don't like my new job? What if I lose a good opportunity here? Stop thinking of the negative and think ""What if I never made the change?"" If you're even in a place where you're daydreaming of a new job, then maybe that's where you need to go. The change in my life started with simply applying to as many legal jobs, but the search concluded with a job that was offered to me through a temp agency. Even though the position had nothing to do with my career choice, I still chose not to fear the unknown. You never know what's on the other side of the road you'll take, so the best way to take that route is to simply go for it and don't look back.

**TL;DR - Quit your job if you're bored, underpaid, and abused. Don't be scared :)**",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/37iu1q/knowing_when_to_quit_your_job/,82,"This list is retarded..

What you are saying is that people should quit when the going gets tough and based on your 'feels'.. 

Here are some grown up reasons to really quit.

1) When you feel you have learnt everything you can about your job.
Chances are, you're really good at a specific job. It's also the reason why you are overlooked for that promotion.. 

And

2) Fish for new opportunities every two years. Jump, if you have something better.

1331,2eukex,False,[advice],76,A not so simple: Job Application Guide!,jobs,"**Tl;dr** [info-graphic summary]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/3yuhnucmsey3alb/INFOGRAPHIC.pdf?dl=0)  
[Resume Layout explained with comments](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxy1mchfseq1do8/Resume%20professional%20example%20layout%20with%20comments.pdf?dl=0)  

**About Me**  

I am a Certified HR Professional with over 6 years of experience.  
Much of my experience has been in recruitment (*I am not a recruiter though*). What this means is that I am the person creating the jobs themselves, creating the postings for the jobs, receiving the applications, screening the applications & applicants, and conducting interviews with / coaching the managers on selection.  

I had many friends and colleagues approach me, throughout my career, asking for advice about their applications and job search *(engineers, nurses, pharmacists, business admin, and various entry level positions.)* ; all were successfully placed after receiving my advice within a reasonable time period (all under 6 months, within a labour market with an average 7.6% unemployment rate over the last 5 years).   

Most recently I was laid off from a job at the end of July (summer is slow job season), and got myself placed within 3.5 weeks after my lay-off.      

I've been reading through many posts about people sending applications and not getting any responses so I decided to create this guide to job search, application writing and submission.  

Hope someone finds it useful.  

**Guide Summary**  

Remember, HR is not a science it’s an art. The purpose of this guide is to give you the knowledge that I have from HR’s side, relevant to screening and selection so that you can better your application and thereby increase your chances of being selected.  

This guide is broken down into 3 segments:  

* Applicant
* Job posting
* Application  

In the applicant segment I go over competencies and core competencies.  This covers your strengths as an applicant and what you should focus on in your application (cover letter and resume).  

In the job posting segment we will dissect a sample job posting and go through what is what and where to look for key information when gearing up your application for submission.   

In the application segment we will cover what you should include, what you should not include and typical do-s and don’t-s when it comes to your application.  
.  
.  

**Applicant**  
“What I can offer”

So you graduated university and are out to look for a job, you think you’ve had no prior job experience and that the road ahead is simply a dead end to part-time work in a field that is unrelated to what you studied.  

Or you’re simply a person who just got laid off and is not having any luck with your job search. Feeling that the world betrayed you and that you’re worthless?  

**FALSE, YOU SHOULDN'T**  

First things first, start with your attitude – you need to be in the right mindset when applying for jobs. You need to be confident but not cocky. Also, self-loathing applicants reflect that in their applications – trust me.  

Before we talk about your strengths, we need to cover what **competencies** are.  
Understanding competencies is important, because that’s what determines what the right **“fit”** is for a company.  

>Competencies are the measurable or observable knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviours (KSABs) critical to successful job performance. Choosing the right competencies allows employers to: Plan how they will organize and develop their workforce.  
[Source](http://www.hr.wa.gov/WorkforceDataAndPlanning/WorkforcePlanning/Competencies/Pages/default.aspx)  

So companies will be looking for a specific set of KSAs (competencies) from their applicants. What this means is that you should *understand your own competencies and their limitations*. People faking it and lying in their job applications are easy to spot to be honest, and get weeded out very quickly. If you somehow slip through and make it, expect a very hard time in the job you landed with false information, unless you ninja your way through and manage to pick up the skills needed as you go. But be honest and ask yourself, do you really want to suffer through that, or would you rather be in a job that is rewarding in terms of experience and brings peace of mind?  

Those competencies are very specific in what they are. So how do employers define those competencies?  

Simple, competency dictionaries – here is my [favourite one](http://campusservices.harvard.edu/system/files/documents/1865/harvard_competency_dictionary_complete.pdf)  

Look through it and understand what you are putting on your resume. For example, when a company asks for good communication skills they typically want what’s in that dictionary. The dictionary will also go through “Key Actions” and “Job Activities” that demonstrate what good communication is. This dictionary is a sample one and does not contain everything and anything of course. Use google.  

**TIP**: Transferable skills, you have them and they cross over nicely to many fields or industries - if you worked as a barista, for example, you have been developing certain competencies: verbal communication, organization and time management, contributing to team success, stress tolerance etc. Those are applicable to working in an office environment, trust me.
  
So now that you understand what competencies are, take a look at what you’ve done in the past in terms of work experience and schooling. Ask yourself these questions:  

* How have they shaped and developed your competencies throughout your life and career?
* What can you do well?  

**Your cover letter and resume need to convey your competencies, VERY CLEARLY.**  Here is the ideal layout of what you should include in your cover letter  to showcase your competencies:  
.  
.  

-----------------------------------------------  
  
Date  
Name  

Dear XXX,  
It is with great interest that I submit my application for XXX position with your awesome company, your company is great because (**blah blah blah I’ve done my research about your company i.e. I’m not writing a generic letter here**) etc.  
  
What I can offer / what sets me ahead of other applicants is XXX (**list your competencies here, talk about them and about how they can benefit the employer, best yet talk about how they match what they are looking for in a candidate**) etc.  
  
My experience, schooling and qualifications have prepared me for this shit, I am awesome and you will love me immediately I promise (**paraphrased, do not include that as is**).  
  
I look forward to further discussing my qualifications with you, I can be contacted at XXX.  
  
Signed,  
  
-----------------------------------------------  
.  
.  

**Job Posting**  
“What they’re looking for”  

So, now we move on to looking at what a job posting will have and what we need to look for when applying for a job.  
Let’s go with [this sample](http://www.hr.umich.edu/empserv/department/newsletter/sampleposting.pdf) for now.  
You will notice some key elements that you need to look at:  

* Typical work duties  
* Minimum qualifications (must haves)  
* Desired qualifications (nice to haves)  

For *typical work duties*, you need to read carefully through them and start mapping your experience and expertise to those duties, relative to your competencies.  

For minimum qualifications or MUST haves, you need to make sure that you have those. If it says min 5 yrs experience, you better have that or make one hell of an argument for that. If you do not have the min qualifications DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  

**TIP**: Students, your degree counts as condensed experience! For all those of you who say: “Scumbag employer says entry level but requires experience” **YOUR DEGREE IS YOUR EXPERIENCE!**  

For nice to haves or *desired qualifications*, make sure you check off as many of those as you can – not having them will not impede your ability to do the job, but having them will tell the employer that you can definitely do the job easier.  

**TIP**: What this typically means is that, as an employer I’m willing to train you on how to do this but it would be nice if you already knew how to.  
.  
.  

**Application**  
“Why you should hire me”  

So now that we understand what you as an applicant can offer and what the employer is looking for. Let’s communicate that to them!  

Do:  

* Include sample work done prior, as long as it is relevant!  
* Be concise but don’t skimp out on the important information  
* Review your application  
* Make sure that you have the minimum qualifications  
* Make sure that your resume’s layout is appropriate: clear font, legible, appropriate for the job  
* Place your strengths first, if you’re a student – education goes first with a summary of what you learnt in each class that is applicable in terms of competencies. If you are experienced, place your work history first (chronologically, summarize the relevant material but don’t skimp out on including juicy details)  
* Be honest with yourself, always  
* Use action words: achieved, organized, obtained
* Use [smart](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~hrs/profldev/performance_management/performance_objective.html) when communicating your achievements  
**Example of SMART**:  
Successfully executed and supported an effective XXX strategy to achieve XXX within X time period.    

Don’t:  

* Include protected property, any work that you’ve done for a company while under their employ will TYPICALLY belong to them, check your previous contract that you signed – you can get sued if you violate it
* Include company logos or indicators on previous works done if you are submitting  
* Lie about your experience, you will be caught eventually and it will suck for you and the employer
* Take the shotgun approach; it’s not a numbers game……  
* Send out generic cover letters, the layout is the same but please edit the material and content (if I see your company, my generic application sensor starts tingling)
* Be oblivious when contacted for a phone interview, know your applications and the positions and companies you applied to  
* Send out generic resumes; tailor your resume’s layout to the job posting. Highlight the competencies the employer is looking for first – if it’s not on the first page, it will most likely not be read!
* Send out a novel of a resume. You say you have excellent written communication skills? Prove it by summarizing your experience into a cover letter and resume without compromising the integrity of the information you’re conveying

1332,2cfcep,False,[advice],54,"I left my job on July 18 with no leads of any kind and no savings whatsoever. Yesterday, I got an offer at my dream job. Here's how I did it.",jobs,"On June 21, I thought I had found the next step on my career path. Literally less than a month later, I quit. I was working 80+ hours a week for not enough money. It was taking a toll on my happiness and my relationship with my girlfriend. 

I didn't know what to do. I had no savings (besides part of my last paycheck and a paycheck that would be small). However, I hustled and here's how I got a job that I feel I'll love with no help from a network, friends or family. 

First off, I treated finding a job like it was a job. I'm sure you've read this before and it's not a joke. From 8 AM to 5 PM, I searched for and applied to jobs. I wrote a specific cover letter for every one of them. Whether it was the cover letters or the website's crazy antics in regards to the information I had to give, it would take around an hour to thoroughly apply for the jobs. So then, I was turning in 8 applications a day, give or take a couple. I feel that every cover letter I sent was epic. On top of this, I still treated my life the same. I woke up at 7 and cooked breakfast. I went to the gym after ""work."" I even went out with friends on the weekends. By the first weekend, I had had a few phone interviews so I felt going out would be fine as I'd hear back from someone. On top of this, I updated my resume to reflect the skillset that I had garnered or expanded upon in my last job. I also killed a lot of the white space on my resume. I don't even have a G.P.A. on it. I feel like a lot of places understand that a G.P.A. isn't really indicative of anything anymore. I had a 3.003 out of school. Not the best and definitely not the best for some careers (so keep that in mind, engineers, IT, etc.) Regardless, I revamped my resume. Reach out to someone if you're not sure. Do not be embarrassed. I would always try to hide my resume from friends or family when I could've used the help. I didn't want them to know how poorly I'd done in college.

Secondly, I found my job on my state's job board. It's a nonprofit that works to help people find jobs. I don't know if EVERY state has these nonprofits, but I just looked up a few in a few major states. Regardless, I'm sure SOME nonprofit in every state focuses on this. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. Why I think this played a major role, however, is because this essentially (in North Carolina, at least) weeded out all the Vector Marketing (sorry Vector people!) and bullshit jobs. Now, if you're in IT or something like that, this may not be an issue for you. But I know plenty of people who are ""qualified"" for some jobs, will get calls back in 30 minutes of applying, and find out that it's a pyramid scheme or uncomfortably close. Regardless, I had confidence that every job that I applied to was a legitimate organization. This meant that I was spending my time wisely.

So I got a phone interview. People put so much emphasis on the actual, face-to-face interviews (and they should), but the phone interview is a very real thing now. You need to be preparing for the phone interview as you apply. If you get a call from a random number, it's probably time for a phone interview. If you're not ready, I can only imagine how hard it is to get to the actual, first interview. Regardless, I figured it was coming and knocked it out of the park. If you get a call from a random number and it's for a job you applied to, IT MAY BE A PHONE INTERVIEW! If you're not ready, tell them you're busy. Do anything that you can to hold them off. Telling them, ""Sorry, I'm headed to a three hour movie"" while you prepare for the interview is obviously reasonable considering they randomly called you. If it's not for some organizations, you probably don't want to work there anyway. 

So I got called in for a first interview. At this point, I had spent the past TWO DAYS studying the organization and practicing my answers. In these two days, I still treated finding a job like my job, but I didn't apply to any new jobs. I simply prepared for this first interview. By the time I got there, there wasn't a question they could throw at me that I didn't have the perfect answer to. I came here to r/jobs, I searched for first interviews, I searched for first interview questions to ask, etc. I studied my answers and how I would say them--at what speed, how I would use my hands, etc. I also practiced my posture so that I could have a confident posture as I interviewed. During the actual interview, I kept careful notice of things like my hand movement and posture and adjusted them accordingly. I kept good contact with all three individuals who were interviewing me. I threw a bit of my personal traits in (like my humor) and made them laugh multiple times. When I couldn't think of an answer RIGHT off the bat, I took my time. I'd sit there in silence for 10 or 15 seconds and gather my thoughts. Then, I'd knock it out of the park. Those of you who aren't necessarily personable, practice it. Practice it for the sake of the interview. I can only imagine how many people have not gotten jobs despite being very qualified for them simply because they seemed a bit stiff or awkward. 

During this first interview, you obviously want to relate every question they ask back to your previous experience or education. This may not work for computer science or engineering, but in a lot of careers, you are going to be asked the EXACT SAME QUESTIONS that you read whenever you Google what questions you may be asked. I can't quite hone in on how many questions I got, but I would say a good 25% were questions I'd heard plenty of times before and had mastered. I had mastered exactly how I would tie them back to my previous experience. 

I knew I killed the first one. I texted all of my friends and let them know that the job was mine. After my first interview, they told me that I'd hear back from them by the end of the week (my first interview was on Tuesday), and that there would only be a second interview if there was another great candidate. On Wednesday, I awaited my offer. Cocky, I know. But I flat-out murdered that first interview. Nothing on Wednesday. On Thursday, I received a call... They needed me for a second interview. Fuck. I had some real, true competition. I was one of two possible candidates. Did I fret? Did I cry and hope I'd get it? Nope. I went back to the drawing board. 

This time, I researched the second interview. I'd actually never had one despite having four jobs since 18 (I'm 24 now). I read that there was a possibility that it'd be a tour and that they'd want to see how I fit in with the organization. I read that the questions would get a little bit more in depth. So I prepared. I prepared my ass off. By the way, the second interview was at 4 PM, and they called me to ask if I could come in for another one at 12:30 PM. Maybe that's their technique... but on my end, it just seemed like a short amount of time. Regardless, I got ready as much as I could. I got more in depth with my answers, and literally practiced how I would speak to people I met to show how I'd fit in with the organization. I went deeper in my research. I went through the first 20 pages on Google to read anything I could on the organization. I could've done more, I'm sure. I knew names, dates, facts, and figures. I knew their outcomes, their budget, their programs, etc. I was ready when it came down to it. 

I went in and was as personable as I could be. They had someone new there to interview me. I had expected the CEO from my research (and prepared questions and answers for her in particular!) but it wasn't her. Regardless, I had practiced everything so many times it didn't matter. I took a tour of the facilities, asked NEW and more SPECIFIC questions to see if I wanted to work there (that's what they're looking for on a second interview, I'd read), and walked out of there feeling like I'd kill that interview too.

But tomorrow, 9 AM came. And no call. I waited and I waited. It seemed like I waited for an eternity. No call. DON'T let this psyche you out. Sometimes it takes time as I learned today. Well, I guess that's obvious. But I just always think they'll call the person who gets the job right away. Anyway, I got the call. Every time I've gotten a job, actually, the person on the other end extending the job offer to me has always sounded somber like they had some bad news for me. This was no different. But I heard the words. ""We'd like to offer..."" I literally teared up. I had no savings. I had reached out to my friends and family but to no avail. I had to continue to make money immediately. And I succeeded when I had to. It literally made me flat-out cry. 

So what did I do exactly? I listened to all of the advice I'd ever gotten. I read long ass bullshit like this. I internalized all of the advice that I'd ever read. I was confident mainly. I answered every question like I'd already had the job. r/jobs had helped me out more than they knew. They'd taught me so much about interviewing and fine-tuning a cover letter or resume. Thank you so much, r/jobs. You helped me find work that is righteous. I'm working for a nonprofit that helps at-risk women. This is an important goal to me. This was also the first job I'd ever gotten where there was solely one position. Every other job I'd ever gotten, there were multiple positions open for the same job title. This one was special. And all the research I did, including here on r/jobs helped me tremendously. 

Stay hopeful. And I hope this information helps someone as r/jobs has helped me.

Background: I'm 24. I had ***11*** internships. I have an MA and I'm at my first fulltime job. Internships suck, companies are taking advantage of people, etc etc. But we (Gen Y) need to reflect a little on ourselves. This is the kind of thing that bothers me: One girl recently told *[The Week](http://theweek.com/article/index/242065/america-is-raising-a-generation-of-interns)*,  “You either do what you like to do for free or you have an entry-level job for $25,000 where you answer the phone and are someone's assistant.” This kind of attitude is a problem. Internships largely do not lead to a job. According to *[this study](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx),* 

> 63.1 percent of paid interns received at least one job offer. In comparison, only 37 percent of unpaid interns got an offer; that’s not much better than results for those with no internship—35.2 percent received at least one job offer.

As young people, we've been raised on the idea that if we try hard enough, we can do anything. We're tumbling into an internship spiral, and we can't afford it. 

Now our parents would say that we should just create our own businesses. And once again, that's a misunderstanding of our generation. Part of the reason why we go through so many internships is because *we desperately want to be accepted into existing institutions.* We're *scared to death* of entrepreneurship.  But here's the thing: Unless you want to get underpaid for a job you're overqualified for (there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm assuming that you're taking an internship in the hope of getting something better), or want another internship, that is your option.

1346,1meujb,False,[advice],42,Just landed a great sales job in NYC. Here's what I did to have a successful job hunt!,jobs,"I'd been trying to move back to NYC after having done an internship here a few years ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't get so much as a call because I was living in Ohio. Well, I sold my car, packed two suitcases and got a sublet for a couple months and, about 3 weeks later, I was employed! I'm working for a great company that should yield some fantastic income and it's something I never even knew I'd be interested in.

Enough about me. Here's what I did over the past few weeks to land a job:

RESUME:
•Personalize each resume you send with company name and position. I kept a general resume and would just change out the company name, position and any skills they mention in the description. Save each one as a PDF with your name, desired position and company and throw it in a folder on your desktop. It takes seconds but why not make sure it's not just a vague, half-assed resume?

•Make sure that there are NO spelling or grammatical errors on your resume. None. Take it to your friend with the English degree. Take it to your university's writing center. I work with several recruiters now who said they can spot a typo within 3 seconds-- and guess what happens to that resume?

•Create a section that lists skills and abilities. Why? Resume searching software pulls keywords!

•Your friend, the graphic designer? Throw him $20 and a case of beer and have them create a great layout, something you can edit. Do you know how many boring, ugly resumes come through?

•If your GPA is above a 3.0, throw it on the resume. Also, add what year and month you graduated. A recruiter mentioned that they like to see it-- and if they don't see it they sometimes view it as a red flag that you didn't graduate or are hiding something.

THE COVER LETTER

•I hated writing these. But write a few drafts. Trim them, omit things and get them down to a reasonable length. Try to throw in the keywords that you see mentioned in the description so anyone scanning your cover letter will pick them up. Keep it concise.

•I had several versions of these because I was considering different roles. I had one for sales, one for corporate advertising/marketing, one for advertising agency and one general one for anything that didn't quite fit the others. If you're applying to very different roles, just have different cover letters, drop in the company name and position and BOOM-- personalized cover letter.

•At the end, don't simply just say ""Let me know if you want to talk"". Offer a time or date when you can come in. Tell them that you'll call them this week to ensure they received the cover letter-- and then CALL THEM FOR REAL. Ask for an interview, even if it's just a phone or Skype interview. Why offer all of this info to them with no call to action?

THE HUNT

•Update your LinkedIn profile. This is now maybe just as important as showing up to an interview because it's what recruiters look at all day long (Source: I work with a team of recruiters and interviewed with another recruiting agency) Recommend people you believe in and write them reviews. Request or hope that they do the same. Join professional groups that have to do with your industry, geographic area or education. Make sure that your LinkedIn profile has your most recent resume and credentials listed! And that photo? Better be professional looking.

•I set aside times of the day to hunt. I started beating myself up after a while when I didn't get up at 7AM and work until 7PM. But what I found is that the timeframe of 1PM-8PM was my sweet spot, so that's what I did. It IS important to keep business hours though so that you can go into an interview at a moment's notice!

•Check out LinkedIn, Indeed, Craigslist and any industry-related search sites. I found Monster and Careerbuilder to be useless.

•See a job you want? Throw down a few bucks and Fed Ex your resume, cover letter and portfolio to the hiring manager. Makes a bigger impression than just another PDF file they delete from their inbox.

•Reach out to hiring managers and HR people on LinkedIn. Ask for interviews!

•Find the name and number of the person doing the hiring? Call them. Ask for interviews! (Seeing a pattern?)

•This is perhaps one of the most valuable tips: try to find a good staffing agency or recruiter that specializes in your field. Why? They're paid to place people, unlike that HR lady you keep bombarding with your resume. Do your homework, but this was incredibly important in me getting interviews, freelance work and, eventually, my job.

THE INTERVIEW:
•For the love of God, don't be late.

•You're not late? Good. What are you wearing? It should match the company culture to the best of your knowledge. Applying to an account firm? Suit up. Applying to be a graphic designer at a boutique agency? Slim chinos and a button down. When in doubt, dress up. 

•On appearance: be clean, well-groomed. Your clothes don't need to be Versace and Armani, but try to look current and put together. If you need to, go drop $50 at H&M and get something a little snazzier than the pleated pants and too-big shirt you bought at Kohls six years ago.

•Also on appearance: nonverbal communication is important. Sit upright, don't slouch. Give a firm handshake, not a dead fish. Make eye contact. Smile. Smile. Smile. (Not too much, you don't want them to think you're too weird!)

•Prepare for the interview. Before you go in, research what the company does. Bring up any (positive) headlines you've seen in the news about them. 

•When they say ""Do you have any questions?""-- ASK QUESTIONS! ""What's your favorite part about working here?"" ""What kind of additional projects could I take on?"" ""What does the perfect candidate look like?"" Whatever their answers are, relate it to you and your experience. If they say they want a proactive accountant, mention how you took it upon yourself to find some billing issue at your last job. Whatever it is, relate their answer to you. Make it so YOU are the solution.

•Create a 30/60/90 Day Plan and present it to the interviewer after you've interviewed once or twice and base it on the info you gather from the interview. Basically, you just write out what you plan to do in the first 30, 60 and 90 days if you're hired. Do you know how impressed the people interviewing me were when I did this? This alone might've gotten me the job.

•If you feel comfortable that you're probably being considered for the job, ask for it! You don't have to say ""Give me the job"", but approach it as ""I'm really excited about this position. If you could present me with an offer, I'd be thrilled to join your team!""

•I've gotten mixed reactions on this one when I mention it to others, but it's ALWAYS worked for me. At the very end of the interview, I say something to the effect of ""You know, I'm great with criticism. Is there anything about me, the interview or my experience that you have any concern over?"" Don't pry, but let them think for a moment. Maybe they'll come back and say ""You're a bit junior for this position and I don't know if you have the experience in CSS or Java that we need..."" Counter that. ""I understand your concern, but I would point out that I am currently learning CSS and Java and that I learned HTML in three days. I may not be a senior programmer, but I learn these languages quickly."" Boom. I don't like to let them walk out with a doubt in their mind about me and it's possibly the last time you'll get to fight for the position before they pass you over!

•Ask for their card. If they don't give you one, ask for the person's e-mail address at reception. Or just address a thank you card with the person's name and company as soon as you leave. Mail it immediately. Come home and write that e-mail (if you didn't send it snail mail) right away. I've been told by recruiters that this separates the ""Maybes"" from the ""Likely New Employees"".

•Consider not taking the job. I know, it's crazy-- but I turned down two really decent offers because I wasn't excited about them. Yes, I moved to NYC without a job and then turned down jobs. Crazy? Maybe. But look-- you'll be spending 40+ hours a week at this place. You are interviewing THEM in a sense, too. If you're not into it, write an e-mail after thinking on it and just say that you value their time and feel that you should no longer be considered a candidate. 

•Go on EVERY interview you're offered. You're overqualified? Go. You're underqualified? Go. You're not interested really? Go. It might seem like you're wasting the other person's time-- and perhaps you are. But it's GREAT for experience. Try out your new questions you've developed. Ask for feedback. Worst case scenario is that you walk away with a new contact, more interview experience and no anxiety next time. I walked into my current position's interview with no expectations and was thrilled when I received the offer. You never know!

ENCOURAGEMENT:
•I had a rule when I was job hunting. If I got a rejection letter or was denied a role, I did 3 positive things like apply to another job, contact a hiring manager or follow up on an application. It keeps you moving forward.

•Eat healthy. Go to the gym. Look and feel your best when you go in for the interview!


I realize this is a wall of text, but let me just put this out here: I have a liberal arts degree from a state college with a decent but not exemplary GPA. I moved to a new city without a job and took a huge risk. But what made me successful, I believe, is that I learned HOW to job hunt and gained some great skills and insight on how to do it. I made it my job to learn how and constantly improve. 

PM me if you have any questions and I'd be happy to answer them!

1347,1rqxt8,False,[advice],41,Here's how to stand out from rest of job applicants and drastically increase your chances to get a job,jobs,"Start a blog!

I know that this might sound funny, but hear me out.

I started to blog a year and a half now.  Since I always wanted to work in marketing, that's what I was blogging about - marketing.

And then, in every resume and cover letter that I sent, I mentioned that I run a blog on that topic, and leave a link.

That resulted that in 5 job offerings, and they all told me they liked my blog, and that it's on of the main reasons they invited me for an interview.

Don't hesitate.  Start a blog.  There are tons of tutorials on YouTube that'll show you how to do it in less then half hour.

And then just write about your area of work and expertise.  Just show what you (can) do.  Teach people how to do something.  Something that you already know how to do.

And don't think too much about the design, and the fonts, and all other unimportant stuff.

Just teach people.  That will show your potential employer that you really understand your craft, and you'll be in much better position that the rest of candidates.

1348,2bsivs,False,[advice],33,PSA: References - its NOT illegal for your employer to give one (even a bad one) (USA),jobs,"Apologies if you already knew this, but it seems to be one of the most pervasive beliefs in job-hunting that employers can't say anything negative about you in a reference check (or that they are only able to give dates you were there, or confirm if you're eligible for rehire).

This. Is. Wrong.  

So many comments are giving the OPs a false sense of hope/security by assuring them that performance that lead to them getting fired (for example) won't turn up in a reference check.  Far better advice would be to help them frame a response that will help them address the situation with potential employers before it comes up.

Don't just take my word for it; here's some reference articles (by a HR Professional and an Employment lawyer) that will - hopefully - put paid to this idea that it's illegal for past employers to give a bad reference. They also give suggestions for how to try and manage bad references while job hunting. I've added one from a manager on ensuring your references are in order.

For all candidates I scan their resume and look at their LinkedIN profile.  Assuming I see enough of interest I take the following actions.

For internal candidates, I email their boss to confirm they are available for release as well as ask for general feedback on their performance.  Assuming I don't know the candidate I also check with any people I know in their department or shared contacts on LinkedIN.

For external candidates, if we share a contact on LinkedIN I call them.  I do refrain if the shared contact is at the same company as the candidate.

For all the candidates that pass this initial screen I send a short email.  It has the position title in the header and reads.

>Hi xxxx,
 
>I am the hiring manage for this position and would like to schedule an initial half hour phone interview with you.  Please share 4-5 30 minute time blocks that meet your schedule.
 
>Thank you,


Tip #1, even if you have carpet bombed your applications don't respond hey thats great can you send me the job description.  You have the title, and the company I work for.  I expect you to be able to put 2+2 together to know which job I'm wanting to talk to you about.

If I had tons of applicants and the positions filled quickly this is honestly enough to pass a person up for.  However since I am having trouble filling this role due to its niche nature I gave the benefit of the doubt.  I sent a meeting invite with a time and date that matched the selection provided and worked for me.  I also included the description in the meeting invite.

Tip #2, don't respond to the meeting invite with thanks, when do you want to meet.  The time and date are in the header.  Most email systems, especially gmail, not only recognize the time and date they provide a nice little button that allows you to accept or decline.

I've had two interactions with this candidate and in both cases they have either demonstrated ineptness or laziness.  Those are not good qualities and frankly I don't have the time or bandwidth to micromanage.

I asked what he did for a living, and he told me he was the CEO of a company that made screws. He offered me some career advice. He said that every time he got a new job, he immediately started looking for a better one. For him, job seeking was not something one did when necessary. It was a continuing process.

Did you want to be patronized or talked to like a child when you were depressed? I've studied in four cities in three countries, and I did an internship at a factory in China.

I'm now in Europe and almost all large companies now want to enter the Chinese market. Sounds great, right? The problem is that it is impossible to get in touch with them. The only time I've heard back it's been ""we'll be in touch"" or ""you don't have enough experience."" Certainly there must be plenty of people who'd want to hire me (I have a STEM/business dual degree too), I just can't get in touch with them or find out where they are. I make my CV and cover letter as a website and send it to companies on Twitter in response when they announce job openings but they don't even look at it.

If you're really in business and have a somewhat senior position you should educate yourself about how the economy works and how a digital business works.

First of all, we are in a global recession due to completely mismanaged monetary policy, which results in money flowing to the top - away from production, manufacturing and entry-level jobs which are cut or replaced with internships, to finance and venture capital who in turn invest in Silicon Valley startups. THIS is why WhatsApp is ""worth"" 19B.

The secondary consequence of this is an environment where labor is abundant while jobs are scarce, meaning employers pay very little and offer no security and won't train employees as that is also a cost. Since nobody wants to train, it is close to impossible to gain experience and skills needed to get a job.

Since you know what it's like to be young and in a shitty situation and are now in a position of relative authority/power, why don't you read up about the realities of the job market and the recruiting process, which is completely failed, and make your company change your recruiting - maybe you can start recruiting right here on reddit?

I also hyperlink where I think the HR employee would copy/paste into Google. The fields usually are the name (link it to their LinkedIn), companies (to their websites), and awards (their websites). I also hide the hyperlink (the underlined blue) so to not ruin the design.

I also have a lot of tips on how to design your cv with an effective flow and what not.

1376,1lmkk8,False,[advice],14,My online job hunting routine,jobs,"I just finished my second round of successful job hunting in the last few years and thought I would assemble what I know that might help others.  This is not THE WAY by any means, simply what worked for me.  A bit of warning up front: I use a Mac and recommend several paid applications.  I am sure there are free options or comparable Windows options but these are what I know and use.

Job hunting is not a marathon, marathons have a fixed length, this is a series of tests like the trials of Hercules and you will be frustrated until you pass them all in a row and win a job.  Or keep sucking at one part of job hunting and wait for someone with bad judgment to pass you to the next test.  The tests are as follows:

0. Have done something in your life to prepare you for the job.  I cannot help you with this.  Often an effective personal narrative is what bridges the gap between your experience and the job requirements in the minds the hiring people.  This is the ‘elevator pitch’ that is the way you tell your own story in a minute or two.  

1. Have a clear, professional, error free resume. 
There is loads of stuff out there on this.  Read some but do not believe any source 100%.  Use any university or public resource you can, have other people read your resume.  If you are willing to move but are not aiming for jobs that will pay for relocation, find an address local to the job you are applying for and use that in the application process.  This is what friends are for and no one will remember the address on your resume when you get the job. 

2. Have a decent cover letter that does not make you sound desperate, bitter, illiterate, or like a robot.
This is not the place to hit a home run.  Just do not screw it up, sound like a literate person, express interest, and do not regurgitate your resume.  The closest I get to the resume thing is a sentence that frames my experience and how I could be a good fit for the job. For example, “I believe my experience, passion, and knowledge would enable me to quickly make a valuable contribution to —- given the opportunity.”  Just looking at that sentence makes me want to throw up but I got a phone interview with that.  No one expects cover letters to be great.  No contractions, no overly personal information(I overcame a crappy mom, etc).  80% of my cover letter is the same every time but I work on a unique sentence or two for each one. 

3. Pass the google search that will happen when a human being sees your resume and wants to know more. 
Your online presence is important. 
My contact info on my resume is: myfirstname.mylastname@gmail.com.  Use something like that with a password used ONLY for this email.  I have an uncommon last name so I can have a cool email but any reference in the first two pages of google refer to me.  So…
 Google yourself.  If your tumblr where you reblog nsfw stuff pops up change your name on tumblr immediately. It is not hard to push bad stuff down the google list by changing your name on those sites or joining sites like twitter, meetup, linkedIn, google+ or the like and only doing/following things that make you look like an active interesting person engaged in your chosen profession.  These big social media sites will dominate your google search quickly.  People like hiring fun people but they get blamed for hiring unprofessional people so do not be someone who reminds them of that guy they had to fire.
Also google your name + your current town.  This is stuff managers do.  If you have something interesting to say or show don’t put it on Facebook, get squarespace and make a website.  You can also get an email address from them so make that your job-hunt email.  If all you want is a blog or portfolio the default setting look pretty good and it makes you look better than people who only exist on Facebook.  These kinds of activities are good ideas, they can actually make you a more networked, engaged person and also make the job of finding a job a bit more creative than sweating over cover letters for weeks or months on end. 

4. Sound like someone who a real person would want to hire on the phone.  
Please remember that starting now, The person you are talking to wants you to succeed.  For some this is the easy part, for others a source of terror.  I do not have a lot of advice but there is a lot of info out there about this.  
 Study the job/interviewer/company as much as possible before hand.  Ask some interesting questions.  Take notes and do not be afraid to ask the other person for a moment to write down something.  It shows a professional interest. 
Treat your body like you are about to do something athletic; eat but not just before; be hydrated, have coffee or whatever you like that is a mild stimulant, stand up and walk around while talking.  Be in the moment having a conversation with a person who wants to like you.    

5. Present in person like you were on the phone  
There is all kinds of info out there on this.  I cared too much on my first few of these and screwed it up badly.  Later, after a 10 month search I got two offers in the same week and in both my internal attitude was like [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtwXlIwozog).  On the outside I was acting the pleasant guy at the fancy party, easygoing, engaged but not expecting anything to come of it.  People feel need and it is not attractive.  
Again, everyone you meet who has a say in the matter wants you to succeed.  

6.  Miscellaneous other hoops(drug test etc).  
I have only had to do this once.  No advice really, just be ready.  People like to say yes but corporations like to say no and drugs are an easy no.  

7.  Don’t get screwed over in the process. 
Passing number eight is, frankly, optional.  
I cannot speak to your situation but I hope you do not let desperation dictate your actions. 
If you feel truly desperate you are like a drunk chick alone at a party, you might get home safe but you will be a magnet for predators.  Sooner or later bad things will happen.    
Another way to get screwed is ID theft.  If you are putting your personal info on dozens of websites and using the same password on all of them then God help you.  If you are using the same password for the email you are giving these websites and have anything involving money going to that email you are beyond God’s help.  
1Password is a great tool that will save your bacon in this.  It remembers passwords, It generates strong passwords, it autofills online resumes.  You use condoms right?  This is a condom for the internet.  You are sticking your very personal info in all kinds of strange places in a job hunt and you need protection.  I Use a password manager to make a very strong password for my job-hunt email.  I do the same for any password on any company or job hunting site I use.  That way every password I put out there is unique and will not compromise my email.  
      
A few other things I do during all this…
I use Scrivener to collect everything I know about a company/job/process.  I print webpages, job ads, and emails to pdfs and store them together so if the website changes or the job ad goes away I have it.  I also put any notes from interviews there.  I date everything in there using textExpander so when a company I forgot about calls me back 3 months later I know what I told them and what they told me.  This is also my todo list as I know which ones I applied to and which ones I forgot about.  There are some cheaper alternatives to this like nvAlt, evernote, or even a job-hunt folder.  This also helps me keep all my cover letters so when I get stuck I can go back and borrow a sentence or two. 
The night before a physical interview I look at it all and note anything interesting.  People are impressed if you notice the job add changed from a month ago.  
TextExpander is a great tool that lets you make abbreviations for common bits of text.  For instance, when I type ddate into a text field it turns into September 2, 2013(for example).  You can whip out a good cover letter by making 5-10 good sentences into their own TextExpander snippets and arrange them in the order you like.  For instance, I might set the abbreviation pplease to expand into “Please consider the enclosed resume for the position of — as advertised on the — website.”  A few more of those, a real sentence or two thrown in and you have a nice, non-crazy cover letter.  This is not needed, but it is what I do.  I also use textExpander to date the files in my Scrivener project.  These are the tricks that make me not look absent minded.  
A big piece of all this is to not present as a bitter desperate person.  The only way I know to do this is to not be bitter or desperate.  Again this is what worked for me.  I focus for 1-3 hours a day on job-hunt work, more if I feel like it, but then care for myself in whatever way I can for the rest of the day.  I think of it as maintaining the machine that will one day be ready to pass a personal interview, the version of me that other people want to be around.  I walk the dogs, play games, exercise, read, etc.  A lot of people, myself included, can spiral into themselves and stew in their own sense of failure.  Think Gollum.

1382,1nlkau,False,[advice],12,"Have you ever said, ""“I am doing my job well. I deserve this promotion and they are looking for excuses not to give it to me”?",jobs,"Last week I was having lunch with a friend of mine, who has been struggling to get a promotion for over a year and a half now.  He feels that every time he talks to his manager about “what’s next” his manager gives him a new skill or capability to acquire before they can talk about him being ready for a promotion.  As we were talking, he said, “I am doing my job well.  I deserve this promotion and they are looking for excuses not to give it to me.”

Have you ever felt that way?  Do you feel that way right now?

If the answer is yes, stop and ask yourself a few questions:

*Why do I deserve this promotion?

*What tangible evidence is there to support that I am capable of doing the job (not your current job, but the “next” job)?

*Do my skills, experiences and results meet those basic expectations of the job description of the role I would be promoted to?

What I find is that most people, when they try to answer those questions, will come back to the fact that they do their current job very well, but they don’t have the skills or experiences for the role they want be promoted to.

Take yourself, and the promotion or job you want, out of the equation.  Put yourself in the position of the hiring manager.  You have probably been a “hiring manager” at some point in your life.  Let’s say you had some car trouble that you couldn’t fix yourself.  Would you hire someone who worked exclusively on motorcycles to fix your car?  Probably not.  For the same cost, you are probably going to go with the person who has the experience solving this particular problem for your particular make and model of car, right?  Well, that’s how managers look at promotions – they want to feel confident that you have achieved success in a particular area before they put you into a role.

So let’s delve into why this perspective does not come naturally to us.  Remember, back in school, how you had a class with identified learning objectives?  You learned those objectives and you got to move on to the next class in that series, which built on the previous class’ learning.  The only prerequisite for the next class was the previous class.

Now when we transitioned from school into the workplace, our classes became roles or jobs.  And the pre-requisite for next job or role, comes with qualifications beyond just having done the current job well.  This creates a gap, that up until this point, we have never faced.

*Now suddenly, we have to do our roles well and take on new skills and experiences on our own in order to progress to the next level. *

After 20-some years of this pattern of advancement, you begin to expect that advancement always works the way that it did in school.  Consequently, you take the same steps that have gotten you the results you want your entire life – following the course outline (or job description, as it were) and waiting for your teacher (or boss) to tell you that you are ready for the next class (or a promotion).  Sometimes the waiting game works, which reinforces it’s the only way to go.  When it doesn’t work the way you expect, it can create a sense of confusion, frustration and a sense of being stuck.

Now what are the people who are getting the promotions doing differently?  Well those people aren’t being limited by the belief that they need to have a job before they can begin to get the necessary experience for the job.  So they seek out professional development and learning opportunities at work (special projects) or on their own (classes). I find this is particularly common with athletes and advanced placement students.  For athletes, there are never lines in the sand for performance – they are always striving for a higher and better performance than the last time.  So a job description isn’t limiting, they are playing a game against themselves to be better and to do more.  For the advanced placement students, they got used to being pushed outside of the current curriculum by themselves, their parents and teachers.  Consequently those individuals are less likely to feel bound by the confines of a job description, they gain the qualifications for the next role and then get promoted to the next level.

So what’s the gap you are facing between where you are right now and the promotion or job that you want?  What can you do fill that gap?  And most importantly,

    *what ARE you going to do to fill that gap?* 

Did you know that writing down your goal and telling others about it makes you 30% more likely to achieve it?  C’mon!  Tell us what you’re going to do!

3) Find the right person. If you can on LinkedIn find out who posted the job and contact them directly. Always ask for advice. I would put the subject line as ""Advice for someone interested in working at Company name"". Then I would ask for advice. It would really help me stand out from the crowd of people who just hit apply now.

4) Follow up. Many people are busy, don't hesitate to follow up a couple of times.

5) Write thank you cards. They're a small touch but help you stand out.

6) Be prepared. Know about the company and people that you're interviewing you.

When you arrive 20-30 minutes prematurely you're actually throwing off my day. Be it cutting my lunch short, or preventing me from using allotted time to handle other tasks. I suppose I could leave you up front until our actual interview time, but I don't want to be a dick.


* I disqualified an otherwise decent applicant because his nails were femininely long for a male. I've got to draw a LOT of conclusions from preciously little information, and this was one of them.

* If I ask what your current income is, don't avoid the question or speak in general terms. An applicant yesterday avoided the question up front, and then my partner asked it again more specifically, and he still avoided it. If you want to work for me, I need to know what you're coming from.


* If I can detect that you're lying about your previous income, and frequently I can, I will assume you inflated it by roughly 10%.

* Appear as though you want the job, even if you don't. You can always decline my offer. But I will not make an offer to somebody who isn't showing some degree of zeal. A fantastic applicant from four weeks ago just called back to ask about the job (which has been filled). I would have brought him on to phase two if he had just acted more interested up front!

* I get a handle on your zeal two ways: The questions you ask me about the job, and the way you close the interview. I absolutely love when somebody wraps up by saying ""Do you have any concerns about me that I haven't addressed?"" and ""What is the next step?"".

* Turned down a guy who works in my tiny niche industry because his tie was loose and the top button wasn't done. I was on the edge, but he seemed a little unmotivated to me and that button made the difference. Again, drawing a lot of conclusions from limited evidence.


* Have solid, concise, honest answers for why you left a previous job. If you talk too much, I'll find similarities between my job and the job you left, and I will hit you with difficult questions.

1388,1t44tn,False,[advice],6,"Quit job with no backup plan, landed job in less than 3 months - Here's what worked for me",jobs,"(throwaway because there might be identifying stuff on my other account)

I'm a writer in my mid-20s who got involved with a content mill. I've only been out of college for a couple years and this was my first grown-up job. It turned out to be a really toxic environment.

I burnt out in less than a year. I made a big decision to take a leap of faith and quit with nothing lined up, because I knew I didn't have the time or energy at that job to look for new work. I had about 6 months of money saved.

That was only 2.5 months ago. I just got a new professional, full-time job in my field that I actually wanted, with a salary and benefits I'm THRILLED about. 

I know part of the equation is luck, but I wanted to share some thoughts on what I think helped the process be (relatively) quick and easy. Hopefully it will help some of you.

- I DIDN'T apply to every job listing I saw in my field. **Over 2.5 months, I applied to maybe 30 jobs at the most, probably fewer**. Most people go for quantity of applications, but I focused on finding listings that I *really* thought fit my skills and experience and that I had a good chance at. 

- **Every single cover letter I sent was customized**. I started from scratch with each one. Previously, I had used a cover letter that was a form letter, more or less, just inserting the company's name and the position title where appropriate. This method is one reason I didn't send a lot of applications: each one took me a fair amount of time to put together. I would write them with the job description at my side so that I could hit the different points in the ad.

- I do have a relatively strong resume (internship experience, freelancing experience, brief stint in marketing aka the content mill), but **I emphasized qualities that you don't necessarily get from jobs or education**. I focused on the fact that I am a reliable and organized person with strong communication skills, and this was what seemed to resonate with most of the people that called me back, not that fact that I worked at such-and-such place.

- Cover letters had very little to do with my resume. The only references to my resume were contextual - more like, ""I happened to be here when I showed this quality off especially well.""

- In the case of the job I got, **I wrote the reasons I wanted to work at the particular job** (it's an area of interest, I admire [specific thing they do], etc.). Manager seemed impressed and brought it up at the interview.

- **I woke up at 8 every day, but I didn't always work an 8-hour day**. Some days I did job search stuff all day, but others I didn't because there just weren't enough positions I found that I wanted to apply to.  On those days, I worked on freelancing or sending emails to people I'd be interested in working with someday. I went to coffee with mentors, visited friends, worked on getting my life back (I had been really depressed working at the other job). Sometimes I watched puppy videos, because sometimes you just need to veg.

- During the interview at my new job especially, I made a point of making eye contact, smiling and being relaxed. I laughed. I made a couple jokes. I wanted to be at my most personable and make a connection.

- **When addressing why I quit a job after less than a year with no backup** I didn't give any real details. You don't have to, and I clearly blew one interview earlier in this stint of unemployment by letting myself talk too much (it was a PR job and I accidentally, in my rambling, said something about wanting to get away from marketing. The fields are similar. Whoops). I said I wanted to move on to pursue new opportunities, such as something in [area of media this job is in].

- I made sure to give all my references a heads-up, and to choose them carefully. After I was hired, the director told me she was ""floored"" by the references I received. **Make connections with people who will really go to bat for you, and then stay in touch with those people**. I'm sending them all ""thank you"" cards.

NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK. **If I hadn't stayed in touch and on good terms with my references, I might not have this job. I really felt like the references clinched it for me**. Get coffee with your old professors. Have lunch with your boss. Message your former classmates on Facebook who are in your field and check up on them. People will help you if you reach out.

----

I know this was long, and some of it might seem a bit obvious, but it wasn't all obvious to me the first times I applied for jobs. I was really scared that quitting my other job would doom me to a very lengthy job search, but I ended up feeling completely refreshed and finding a job I actually want to do. I also believe that in my mental state while working at the content mill, I wouldn't have given a very strong interview or had time to write more tailored cover letters.

I hope everyone's job search goes well and that maybe this post will help someone just a little.

For the record, I know quitting a job with no fallback plan is not for everyone and isn't technically a wise decision, but it ended up being the best thing for me in my case.

1394,31mvbo,False,[advice],6,Looking for advice on current job.,jobs,"*(Throwaway due to coworkers knowing my main account)*

Without going in great detail, I'm seeking advice on my current job situation.

Currently, I work what one might consider a first ""real"" job out of college. But, it's nothing that truly holds true to my degree. Yes, it somewhat similar, but it's not what I'd consider something I went to college for. Without typing out long and endless paragraphs, I figure I'd just give bullet-points on what facts I've gathered myself and ask some question(s) after:

* I've been with the company around three months now. I'm mostly trained up, and can do most of the work without help. *I plan on sticking with the company for around 6 months currently, or until summer.*

* I get paid around 12.00 an hour, 40 hours a week. No overtime. Boss said it's around 26,000 a year, without taxes taken out.

* From my point of view, my hours are horrible. I work times between 12-1:00am in eight hour shifts, one hour break, with a bit of a commute (20-mins) each day. This includes every weekend and every holiday. (I cannot take off any holiday) I have zero social life at the moment due to everyone else having ""normal"" day jobs.

* This current company has VERY high turnover in my position, and there is no room for advancement, and no chance of a raise.

* This current job is both high and low stress, often going from 0 to 100 in about thirty seconds sometimes. But my coworkers are nice enough to help manage that stress.

* What I currently do is not what I want to do with the rest of my life. But it's the first thing that came along that I could take with having to support myself after college. I'm learning some very good skills, but only a select few apply to what I want to be doing later in life.

So, I have some question(s) that I would perhaps like some answers or advice on:

As hiring professionals, we always read applications that aren't perfect. It happens, and it can be silly or become a fun anecdote. But, we don't use those hiccups to make judgments about our candidates and their qualifications. Doing so leads to a slippery road of zero tolerance over the most trivial matter (using plain copy paper instead of heavy card stock for your resume, are you desperately trying to show that you're not interested?!). I wish people who are taking hiring serious, AS THEIR JOB, could look in the mirror and evaluate their own processes first, before pointing the finger at applicants for not doing enough or assuming they are making ""common"" mistakes.

1403,2o1nzg,False,[advice],6,After two months I landed my dream job - advice and thoughts,jobs,"Hello,

I'm a recent graduate from a top university in the UK. For years I have wanted to break into investment banking on the markets side of things (sales/trading) but without any direct past finance experience it was an uphill battle.

I've sent hundreds of linkedin messages, written over 80 specific cover letters and revised my CV countless times. I recently just passed the first and second final round interviews and was offered a position on a 2015 graduate scheme in markets.

This sub has been helpful to me and I hope others can benefit from my experiences. Note that this is probably most apt for people looking at landing their first graduate job.

**Get Passionate**
- Whilst passion doesn't come across easily on paper, particularly when applying for conservative fields, it stands out at interview. I am passionate about the bank I am joining and the direction of its markets business - I made sure that this genuine enthusiasm and energy came across face to face.

**Network**
- The benefits of networking need not be stated but honestly this helped me so much. I found it was less about the ability of your network to refer you to HR or offer you a job, but the insight they provided in the industry and advice such as how to approach interviews and what to read.

Furthermore in your professional career networking is not an additional task - it is fundamental to every business relationship. It's about developing rapport, knowledge, lingo, confidence and more.

**Knowledge**
- So I didn't have any prior financial work experience/internships whereas some of the other applicants had numerous finance internships. Knowing this limitation I made sure to work harder when it came to my own reading. I studied technical textbooks for days on end so that my knowledge would be at least equal, if not greater than, the other more experienced applicants. In my final interview I was sat across a technical chap who outright stated that the technical book I cited as reading was ""his favorite book"".

**Leverage**
- I leveraged my previous experience in a non-related field to demonstrate the qualities required for the role. You have to know what the role demands and then understand how you fit in. Don't be afraid to bring up non-related experience, just frame it correctly and confidently. If anything I used this as my point of difference, arguing the unique perspective I could bring.

**Refine** 
- When I first started writing applications I thought I had a killer template. By the end of writing applications I cringed when reading my first drafts. There's always so much room for improvement. If I were to do it again I would have spent longer on refining my early applications instead of a trial-by-fire approach.

**Competency Questions**
- So yeah, they are awful. Truth is though they are a sort of shit-test so you can demonstrate the effort you are willing to put in to get the job. In almost all careers you're going to have to do things you might not want to do, by answering competencies well you can tick this box.    

I'd like to note in my final round interview I was asked a few ""standard"" competency questions, I felt I developed really good rapport with the interviewers and went slightly off script. I told them an answer which sort-of, but not wholly, fit the criteria they asked. I then directly told them ""I know that doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I think that this question is really about my ability to X, in that case I have proven that by doing Y & Z.""

**Final Thoughts**
- I was frequently told by both family and strangers that ""something would come through"" and whilst I'm not usually one for banal platitudes there is an element of truth. It is possible that after all my hard work I could still have fallen short and not been successful, in that case I'd have widened my net and gone to plan B. However the important thing is to truly commit to your efforts, don't short change yourself and slack, if you can go the extra mile in technical reading/networking then do it - even if it's not successful it's giving you skills, determination and strength of character which will help you in the future.

Wishing you all the very best.

*I got hired and worked with with company A for two weeks.  Now my dream job at company B just made me an offer.  Should I quit?*

And the answer in this subreddit seems to always be the same:

*Yes.  The company doesn't really care about you, and if it wasn't working out for the company, they wouldn't hesitate to fire you.*

I've come to disagree with this advice. First, I don't really think this line of reasoning is entirely true.  Yes, this is true for some companies, but in my experience, it doesn't happen very often.  Usually, employers fire new hires with a reasonable cause.  If a perfect candidate suddenly sends her resume a few weeks after a position is filled, a manager normally wouldn't fire the new hire to bring in the perfect candidate.

Second, it harms your reputation.  You're essentially burning a bridge with the company and all coworkers you have burdened.  Even if you put in notice, you will still put a lot of burden on the company.  I believe this is a huge risk for an unknown job.

Of course, there are some good exceptions to quitting so soon:

* You're working at Walmart as a greeter and you just got an offer from Google as Lead Engineer.

The reason people on this thread tell people to take the dream job, or even a better job after a short time, is because a lot of us (myself included) have been thrown out with the trash at a company despite stellar performance and great relations with coworkers and supervisors.  Some bean-counter somewhere saw my position and how much I was paid and crossed it off the ledger, and that was that.

It doesn't matter what company you work for, doesn't matter how cool and understanding your boss or CEO is, doesn't matter how long they've been in business, doesn't matter how long you've worked there or how hard you've worked or how successful you've been in your position:  your company doesn't give a *shit* about you.

1417,17g47q,False,[advice],7,How I Save Gobs of Tedium Filling out Application after Application,jobs,"I know budgets are tight, but if you are filling out tons of job applications, you can do yourself a huge favor by investing in text completion software. 

This is software that is constantly running on your desktop/laptop computer (ie Windows and Mac) and transforms bits of text (""snippets"") into words, phrases, or sentences. (For example, ""vi"" is transformed into ""Vandelay Industries"" once tab or space is pressed.) 

In my case, I use TypeIt4Me ($5) for Mac. If you're on Windows and are willing to learn a new syntax, AutoHotKey is a free and highly flexible option. (I actually came to like the latter very much once I learned it's archaic ways.) 

Anyways, for each job I've had in the past, I have created a standard set of snippets. 

* First, I create a unique snippet to expand into the company name. (i.e. ""vi"" from above). 

* Next, I create snippets for that company's address and for other commonly requested data. To make things easy, I begin each snippet with the letters that comprise the company snippet. (e.g. ""vipos"" for the position I held at Vandelay Industries and ""vides"" for a description of my job duties.) 

So, for an example, here's the template I use:

>vi - Vandelay Industries

>vist - 555 Broadway Boulevard

>vicity - New York, New York

>viz - 00000

>vipar - (555) 555-5555

>vidash - 555-555-5555

>vipos - Vice President, Sales (Latex)

>vides - Sold latex to importers across the U.S. Goes on for several sentences and can even include multiple paragraphs. 

>vipay - $50,000

>visup - Bob Henseley

There. Once you set this up, you can use it on tons of online applications that require you to describe each job you've been in, one-by-one. And because you use standard syntax (e.g. ""…st"" always yields a street address), you can mindlessly enter in this info and avoid errors.

Plus- my tips on filling out a memorable (min. wage job/retail) application!,jobs,"I was underemployed, working part-time retail at a clothing store at the mall.  I've been looking for a second job for months, and finally got hired!  I am now also a cake decorator at a local grocery store.  I had work experience working in a bakery but no cake decorating experience but applied anyway even though they were asking specifically for ""experienced cake decorators.""  I'm very excited!  Today I finished day two of training.

It's rough looking for minimum wage jobs.  It takes a lot of time.  It's a pain in the ass!  

**Here are some tips I have and things I've done that have helped me get (retail) jobs:**

* Keep applying!  Don't bank on one job.  Put in as many applications as you can.  

* Make a professional looking resume, and staple it on top of your application.  You can even make a cover letter, too if you'd like, but I never did.  (In some cases, I guess a cover letter might be over-kill for this type of job, but I don't know.)

**When you're ready to turn in your application:**

* Go to the store in person dressed very professionally.

* Smile and be nice to everyone you see.  Try to be confident.

* Ask for the manager.

* Shake his/her hand and introduce yourself.  Give him/her your resume + application.  ""Hello; how are you.  I'm so-and-so, I'm a student here/new in town.  I'm applying for the [whatever] position.""  Smile your face off (but not in a [scary way](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mag4auYoHa1qcja3b.jpg)).  
EDIT: If you're not applying for a specific position but are willing to do whatever job they give you, that can be a strength.

I mentioned that I'm willing to work in different departments, so if a cashier calls out, they can call me in to cover for them, which will help your employer out a lot.)  


**On the application:**

* Write as neatly as possible.  Seriously, take your time.  I have good hand-writing, but I really slow myself down on the applications to make sure everything's clearly legible and spelled correctly.  Use white-out if necessary.

* Of course, fill it out as completely as possible.  

* Sometimes the applications will have optional questions like ""What other skills or technical training do you have that could be relevant to this job?""  DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE CHEESY!  I don't have technical training, but on my application, I wrote ""Teamwork!""  It's cheesy, sure, but it's also true- in my past jobs I've had to work on teams, and I'm good at it.  You could also write hard-working, fast learner, determined, ambitious, or something along those lines.  If you fill out more info than necessary on the application, it shows that you really do want the job and are willing to put time and thought into your app.

* Also, on some apps, there will be a space with a question like ""Why do you want this job?"" or ""Why do you think you'd be good for this position?"" or ""Why should we hire you?"" or something like that.  Tell them!  They want to know that you want the job for more reasons than just ""I need money.""  If you like the products they sell or the atmosphere of the store, tell them that's a reason.  If you could be passionate about the position, tell them!  On my cake decorator application, I knew I was lacking the experience they wanted so in this section, I wrote a short paragraph something along the lines of: ""I loved my time working at [competitor] in the Bakery.  I liked the work, and it's given me relevant experience.  I wasn't a cake decorator; however, I had some experience baking/icing cupcakes/writing on cakes/blahblah, and I really want to be a cake decorator.  I may need some training, but I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  I'm reliable, and always show up on time.  Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.""  <- I think that answer is what got me the job.  When I came in for my interview, it wasn't really an interview.  We chatted casually for a bit, talked about what I'd done before in the bakery, and then she showed me the area, introduced me around, had me ice a cake, and then gave me my uniform!!  

* Be genuine.  Don't take my advice and say you're great at teamwork if you go into the interview and can't back up that claim with a story about how you once had to be a team player in some work scenario.  Just be honest, be yourself, and be willing to try new things.  

Well, I think that's about it.  I hope some of these tips help any of you looking for retail jobs.  These are tips I've acquired within the past two-to-three years of looking for work and working.  :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1fe21s/i_got_hired_plus_my_tips_on_filling_out_a/,11,"To add another point to this excellent list: when you get to the ""personality"" questions, answer it so that it makes you look *good* (lie even if you have to).

For example, the question may ask: ""everyone knows someone who has stole something"".  Answer may range from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree.""  In this scenario, you might be inclined to answer somewhere in the middle: ""Agree.""  But that's the **wrong** answer!  For the sake of scoring an interview, you are an honest person who only associate with honest folks!

I'm pretty sure answering these kind of questions honestly resulted my application being sorted automatically by computer into the ""no"" pile many times.  While it may seem like I am encouraging lying, I am a strong believer that these kind of questions shouldn't even be asked on applications if the employers aren't expecting honest answers.

1422,3jaxn4,False,[advice],4,Advice on Job Offers (x-post from r/Biology),jobs,"Hello! I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me advice on two job offers that were offered to me. First, I'd just like to give a little bit more info about myself.


I am a recent graduate as a biology student (B.S.). I have no previous lab or work experience since I focused majority of my time in school, so I am VERY excited and grateful to have any job offers at all. In the future, I hope to transition into more computer science / software engineering, or maybe even something like bioinformatics. Since I am thinking of going that route, I am also thinking about going back to school to either get a M.S. or another B.S. in CS or SE if I have to. But this is way in the future once I have enough money saved up!


So here are the two offers that were given to me as I looked for a job:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 1**: Lab Assistant (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* $13.27/hr  – No clocking in or out, so it’s kind of like salary.
               -Flexible hours for when to start/leave, and flexible lunch break.
* Accrue PTO hours – 5 hours per paycheck (Every 2 weeks).
* HMO, vision, and dental. 
* 401K available, but no matching.


--Pros: 
* Flexible hours are nice. As long as I work about 40 hrs a week, no one seems to mind what my hours are.
* Not as strict with regards to workplace as long as I finish my work since I would be working with the rest of the lab techs only.
* I am fairly familiar and comfortable with the duties assigned to me.
* I can get great references for future jobs or for grad school (well-known as well as new Ph.Ds). 

-Cons: Quality Assurance for pharmaceutical (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* No overtime. And based on what other workers I have spoken to said, I will usually end up staying longer than 8 hrs per day (~8.5 hrs, sometimes maybe even 9).
* Less money
* Further from my apartment, (~30 minute drive).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 2:** Quality Assurance in Pharmaceutical
* $14/hr for the 1st year as a start, annual performance review. 
* 1 wk vacation for first three years, 2 wks after three years, 3 wks after five years.
                -3 sick days per year.
* HMO, vision, and dental included after 30 days.
* 401K after 90 days +$250 annually for contributing to 401K.

--Pros:
* More money is always nice. With this, I make almost an extra $100+ a month, and almost $1000+ more annually.
* Overtime (1.5 hrs) for whenever I work after given hours.
* Closer to my apartment (>10 minutes away using side streets).
* Less wet-lab work.

Cons: 
* Most of the tasks that will be assigned to me are things I know little to nothing about.
* Stricter start/end and lunch times since I have to clock in and out. 
* I don't know if references for this job will be as useful as the other in the future. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So my questions are: 
1. Which job offer would be better to take?
2. Which job offer will be more beneficial financially?
3. Which job offer will be more beneficial in the future career-wise, or would help me reach my future goals better?

Thank you in advance to anyone that helps!

For me personally, the difference between 13.27 and 14/hr is minimal at best, though if you have debt or sizeable expenses you may feel different.

You'd also want to think about the type of people you'll be working with and working for. Nothing sours a role faster than bad co-workers/bosses.

A couple of days before I was going to start the job I was contacted by  the NYSDOCCS and was offered a job there, again this paid more than what I was going to be paid at the pest management agency. I went in to the agency and let the managers know that I was going to be going upstate to begin working in Albany.  

I was only at he academy a week before I seriously injured myself in a car accident, which prevented me from returning. I had a lot of time to think about it and I decided that the lifestyle I would have to live working with the NYSDOCCS was not one I wanted. There's nothing wrong with it, but it isn't for me.

1454,1oa485,False,[advice],8,Is there really a skills gap/labor shortage in the (skilled) trades?,jobs,"I realize this may be difficult to answer. However I was hoping someone in this subreddit might have some insight. I think we have all heard how the skilled trades are in decline and that people are needed desperately in these fields: plumbing, electrician, pipe fitting, various mechanical technicians etc. I think you get the idea. Mike Rowe, from Dirty Jobs, has been championing the skilled trades fairly heavily. He even has a website for it. 

However, I have heard numerous statistics about this situation. One is that there is a shortage now. The other I heard is that there will be a big (Bigger?) shortage in the next 5-10 years because (apparently) the average age of these workers is quite old. I was reading the average to be in the forties and fifties. Thus, I wonder if the claim is more geared towards the future than now. Mostly, I wonder why so many people have not jumped on the skilled trades road to employment. I imagine many people are saddled with school debts and are reluctant to do more school. Of course, the skilled trades is still school and it costs money. I think this could be the main reason and I think breaking into these fields is more difficult that it sounds. However, with all the unemployed, it seems like more people should have jumped on this awhile ago or maybe not.  The economy started to get bad in 2007 and 2008. If people started a 4 year degree in that time, they would have graduated only a couple years ago. So its feasible most people just didn't know about the skilled trades (like me) and are only figuring things out too late.

1. I see that you'll look at Facebook profiles as well.

2. Looking for smiles, a certain way of dressing, how friendly/polite they approach you seem to serve the purpose of making *you* feel special.

Perhaps you can further explain how these trivial physical behaviors can account for variances in job performance/satisfaction/needs of the organization?

3. If the purpose of the job fair is to connect potential applicants with the organization, and for the organization to show a presence for applicants to consider, why is there such a strict list of criteria on whether or not they are *allowed* to further explore the company with us? From the way it was written, it sounds like we all have a checklist to mark off when someone comes to talk to us; and if they don't meet enough of our criteria, they can't work at the company.

1467,3lpl0z,False,[advice],2,Should I trust my gut feeling and discard this job opportunity?,jobs,"Hi all,

I would like to hear your opinion and advice about a mixed experience I am having for a job opportunity and my participation in psycho-analytical tests during the recruitement process.

I have 15 years of experience as an IT professional, both in technical and managerial roles. With ups and downs, I have grown a valuable list of experiences of which I'm quite proud (in an humble way). From educational perspective, I hold a Master's Degree in Engineering with major in computer science, I am a PMI-PMP certified project manager, I hold several technical certifications and am tri-lingual.

Recently a recruiter from a well known company in my region contacted me to discuss my interest in a teamleader position in the IT-department . In the first round, I had a good conversation in their office with the HR recruitement lady, then the week after I was invited for a follow up interview. This second interview started with a 1-hour conversation with the IT Director : this was an excellent experience and I really felt that there could be a match with a lot of valuable benefits to achieve together for the company. I felt I could support the local departement to improve some of their inefficiencies and resolve some of the ""pains"" that the IT Director was dealing with while working to establish a multi-year roadmap for backoffice applications. This conversation was followed by an ""interview"" with the IT Architect of the department : this was really an inferior experience from interpersonal perspective, which right away gave me a very bad gut feeling about the position and the whole dynamics in the department. From what I heard, my conclusion is that the guy was sucking energy away from the teams. Our conversation was extremely technically oriented and didn't leave ANY room for interpersonal interaction (I did pretty well on the technical subjects I think). When I tried to create an opening towards the end of the conversation, my perception was that this person's character is really kind of unbalanced :  I think he is one of the reasons which negatively influence the vibes  of the teams and the interpersonal interactions (of course, this is a preliminary conclusion, I cannot make a final evaluation about a person after just 45 minutes of interaction, but I need to do with that snapshot to make my current opinion about the job opportunity).

Anyway, when the HR recruiter called me the next day to discuss my perception and feedback, she acknowledged the difficulties that people have in interacting with this IT Architect. We agreed to continue the recruitement process because the IT Director and me both had a really good mutual feeling about a potential collaboration with each other. However, I remain highly concerned because this IT Architect would be on the same hierarchical level as me and I would need to collaborate with him very intensively daily : if constantly there a difficult interpersonal interaction, then frustration and negative vibes will slumber around the corner…. I could start to hate my job after only a couple of months.

Now comes the real issue. As part of the recruitement process, they also asked me to fulfil an online psycho-analytical assessment. One of the components in this assessment was 'logical reasoning' : the test was showing 5 graphical patterns of figures and asked for the 6th 'logical follow up pattern'. This Sunday afternoon, I was exercising and doing intensive sports for 3 hours. When I came home, I decided to finish the assessment and perform this 'logical reasoning' test (because I don’t have time fort his on weekdays) : unfortunately, I did badly - only 60% of the questions completed within the timeframe given and it makes me really disturbed.

Now, to be clear, and in all modesty, I don't have any doubt about my abilities to perform very good logical reasoning, as has been obvious in the past 30 years of secondary school, college, university, and professional career. Again in all modesty, I often feel like I perform as one of the best during professional assignments and I hold very high standards when delivering my work, often thinking far outside the strict borders of my job, making sure all aspects of an assignment logically match end to end.This is recognised and appreciated by peers,management and customers. Moreover, a couple of weeks ago I performed a similar trial test on www.jobtestprep.co.uk and had a percentile 95 score for a similar test with logical patterns. However, today I really performed bad – I’m concerned about the context in which this is embedded. 

Now, to end my post, I must say that I found the whole framework and outcome of these tests somewhat humiliating. A 24-minute test would need to objective my intellectual capabilities to perform logical reasoning and be taken as an important argument in hiring me or not. The experience worsened my gut feeling about the job and the company. In the past years, I have learned to rely more on my instincts : I also read several articles in the past years that said never to underestimate the importance of your gut feeling and instincts.
On the other hand, this company is really one of the top players in my region and it would be a very relevant professional experience for a couple of years with good pay. I also sincerly feel that I have the skills to really make a difference in that department and to improve the dynamics, energy and performance of the team. On the other hand I currently have a job and I don’t need to make a career step with urgency.

Coming to a conclusion, my current idea is to discard the whole opportunity (with some pain in my heart) based on my gut feeling and the high risk that I see in very difficult interpersonal interactions with that IT Architect. Moreover, I feel that this psycho-analytical test is badly timed and interferes with more fundamental elements about the job that should have been prioritised.

Your opinion would be highly appreciated.

1468,18458r,False,[advice],4,I just got a job and would like to give back.,jobs,"So I was recently hired for a position utilizing my sciencey background, engineering and math and I graduated last year, but it took until now for me to find a job.

Here are some of the facts that I learned while adventuring as I see it.

* Being unemployed does not mean you do not have a job. To the contrary, your job is to find a job, three applications a day is more than enough. While on this train of thought, it is important to apply to jobs that you want to do, if you think you will be unhappy and you get an interview it will likely show through. If you are in dire need of a job, take anything, help neighbors (not necessarily for pay because it is a good thing), and stay positive.

* If you can still rely upon your parents for support do so. This allows you to focus more time on your job search because well you want to get out and be on your own. For me, I was living with my mother in section 8 housing and she didn't have internet but the local library had free wifi and it was a seven minute walk. Thus, I would go to the library for work and keeping tabs on news, not for videos or other things.

* Network. Yes I know that this is beaten in your head, but my concept of networking involves using friends and family as well as personal connections, but not to acquire a job, but to ask them if they know anyone who might know anything. This does several things, it avoids placing them into an awkward situation for them to say no if you were to ask them for a job, it informs them that you are seeking and the field in which you are seeking, it casts your net wider.

* Resumes ideally should be at most one page. As always there are exceptions, but in my instance I kept mine at a page until last October when my article was published which meant adding three lines to a full, not stuffed, page. Prior to this I had messed with formatting, awards were in two columns, and font size was 11. With the publication, I changed the font size to 12 and made the award list into a single column. I also lead with my education and grade point, I am proud of mine so I display it, followed by experience and I believe that 3 is ideal and you do not need to show continuous employment. When it comes to an objective, I am a little torn it really depends on your experience and what you are looking for, some of my resumes had it some did not, this was the only piece of my resume which was customized but only by field.

* Cover Letters: I originally started off with one generic cover letter for engineering and this got me one or two nibbles but was not the way to go. My cover letters were far more effective when I had them targeted toward field, such as engineering, modeling, analyst. One page is again what I strove for, the HR person or recruiter does not have that much time on his hands so shorter is better. Also I was never good at plugging in keywords, there is an art to this that I did not master.

* Preparation. Should you have an interview there are a few tips that saved me. When the recruiter/HR gives you a call out of the blue they will usually announce whom they are and the company, this is a great time to say, ""Hey, now is not a great time to talk can we talk tomorrow at 3?"" A recruiter would love nothing better than to catch you unawares, this gives you time to prepare while also demonstrating that you can think on your feet. For your interviews, I know we all spend far too much time on Reddit/Internet... Interviews are like final exams, there are people who can ace them without studying but the vast majority of us plebians need to study and prepare. Each interview is different but first ones are usually screening interviews, don't close any doors like relocating, and know details about company and position. Second interviews can be behavioral/situational, this means much more preparation, I probably prepared for about twelve hours the week prior for the job I was just offered. In person interviews can be an entirely separate can of worms, prepare some more. At the end of my interview process I probably had 7 pages of situational questions and responses and 2 pages of questions that I was ready to ask. A good tactic is to ask about their experiences and get them to talk about their life. Everyone's favorite topic is yours truly.

* How I was hired... I networked. A friend's parent is an executive at the company, but this only got me past the first screening stage, and even then I had to stay flexible in my responses, no closing doors. I remember seeing stats about referrals that those who are referred have a 50x higher chance of being hired, this is where the network comes in, they can't help you if they don't know you are looking or what you are looking for. For the final interview, I was able to have a conversation, not an interrogation, and I asked more questions of the interviewer than they did of me. I asked about what they enjoyed and how they adapted and got them to talk about their experiences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/18458r/i_just_got_a_job_and_would_like_to_give_back/,7,Thanks for this.

And how does that connect to the current need of that organization right now? How will your candidates individually benefit from understanding those information, in terms of future job performance for that particular position?...If job performance is even an issue that is driving the hiring right now.

It's easy to say that this is ""Interview 101"", but I rarely hear job-fillers say ""I need candidates to understand how Recent Event ABC has impacted our need to look for workers with Attribute XYZ, because having those would significantly impact the company in meeting its goals.""

Unfortunately, it's usually ""You need to look up anything you can about our company. And if you don't know those trivia, *that says something about you*"", with ""that"" being something along the lines of incompetence.

1474,1qakrk,False,[advice],3,Any advice would be appreciated.,jobs,"So as of right now I am working 2 jobs. One I hate and the other I enjoy. Both are only part time, but one pays more than the other.

A little background first. I went to Culinary School and ended up dropping out due to depression and family illness. I have worked as a cook/line cook for 10 years, and have 2 years of management experience. I walked out of my job in early 2013 and spent 8+months searching for work. I finally got a job washing dishes at the local Denny's for minimum wage. 3 days after I got the job, I was contacted by a grocery store that I had put in application in and forgotten about. I went through hiring process and was hired making $8.50 an hour. I was thrilled. Fast Forward 2 months and I am regretting having 2 jobs. I work til 11pm at denny's then have to go to work at the grocery store at 6am sometimes 5am. I am working about 45 hours a week now and maybe get 1 day off a week.

  I absolutely dread going to work at Denny's. I work 4 days (now that they cut my hours) usually only 5-6 hours shifts. The only thing I dread about working at the grocery store is the lack of sleep I have between the 2 jobs. 

  I really want to quit Denny's but I feel obligated to them because they gave me a job after 8 months of searching. I just don't see a future with them, because I realize I can make more money elsewhere. They want me to become a cook for them, but they want me to do the online training on my time. (Which I don't have much of.)

Sorry for the wall of text just need some kind of advice. TL;DR I have 2 jobs and hate 1, but feel obligated to quit the job I hate.

Don't quit yet though. Is there any way to increase your hours at the grocery store? Perhaps work in a different department? If not, start looking for new opportunities immediately. You have lots of experience but since you live in a small town and don't have a vehicle then get creative. Look into catering companies, hospital or care home cafeterias, hotels with restaurants and even bed & breakfasts! Approach places that aren't actively hiring, tell *everyone* that you are looking for work, look to your local or regional subreddit for advice too.

1475,3hy14k,False,[advice],0,Need advice dealing with unreasonable subordinate,jobs,"There is a supervisor, subordinate to me, who has been at my current job slightly longer than I have (8 years vs 7). I've been promoted to be his superior as his schedule has been limited, he had some earlier health issues which cost him to miss a lot of work, etc.

Recently he got sick again. With no vacation time left and no sick time left either, I put in, with my boss' in-writing blessing' 40 hours but told him I would have to take some vacation time initially to cover my ass. 

We had a meeting discussing his future and decided on a modified schedule until he gets back on his feet. I told him about what I was going to do as my hands are tied and it isn't my money...He seemed fine with it as he left.

He later threw it back in my face via email that I am exacerbating the situation, making life stressful and hellish for him and now he says he'll go on disability and doesn't know if/when he'll be back.

From a quick phone conversation with my boss regarding this, I also found out he'd been making comments about me to my superiors. Nothing egregious, but enough that they had to take notice and were monitoring the situation. Of course this whole situation skews them towards my side, thankfully.

Given that, I'm basically done with him and will be happy when he's gone. But he's the type of person who will stick around out of spite.

So I guess my question is this: How do I make this problem employee leave while still covering my own ass?

1486,34b9vg,False,[advice],2,Would like some opinions on my current situation of temp employment.,jobs,"I will just lay this out in a simple timeline and then add a little blurb at the end for my real question.

Sept  - Get hired for temp to hire position at large company along with one other person, told they are trying to fill two permanent positions within 6 months.

Sept - Dec  - Consistently told by my supervisor as well as temp company that I am exceeding expectations.

End of Dec - supervisor tells me she is moving ahead to get the authorization to offer me full position. 

January - Supervisor leaves company, replaced by previous supervisor who had left to work for different emerging department. 

End of January -  Other temp is fired for bad attitude and underwhelming performance.

February - Temp pulled from different department and brought in to replace him, I do all of the training for the position.

March- This is my 6th month and I ask about the permanent position and whether or not it will happen, reassured that they are going to, but issues with budget are delaying it.

Now - Still told that budget is holding it back but as soon as its cleared I will be offered the position.


I am a no longer recent grad (finished Dec of 2012) my student loans are too large monthly for me to pay on the temp wage but manageable on the permanent position's salary. I like the job, the benefits and salary are more than acceptable assuming I get hired.It feels as though I am just going to be stuck in an endless temp position losing money and getting further behind.

Not sure what my options are, I have not been actively looking for a perm position while in this role, mostly because my resume falls a little flat, good education, but have only had a series of 3-6 month temp positions with no permanent positions. Not sure I can wait this out much longer, but feel that jumping to another temp position would be even worse.

Why do people write so much about this topic? Isn't it like educating the masses to wear a black belt with black pants? Shouldn't everyone know this already?!

Surprisingly, people write about this because candidates still make rookie mistakes in interviews. From my own experience, I interviewed three people in the last four weeks, and I heard and saw some crazy things. Interviews can be intense, so let's go over a few Do's and Don'ts:

**INTRODUCTIONS**

Do: Stand up, make eye contact, and shake their hand firmly
Don't: Shake their hand while sitting down

This is kind of the ABCs of introductions, but it is surprising how many people do not shake hands and do not rise when introduced to you. Whenever I am introduced to someone new, whether they are below me in position or above, I always make sure to stand up. Maybe it is something that the military taught me, but it is a sign of respect. Doing so will show that you respect the person, and they tend to remember you better. Also, give a firm handshake. You are not trying to break the person's fingers, but the worst handshakes are like holding a dead fish.

**RESUME**

Do: Bring along a copy of your resume in case
Don't: Bring in a different resume than the one you submitted

I had a candidate bring in their resume, which was drastically different than the one I had previously read. It had much more detail than the one I had been given, and given that I had a limited amount of time with him, I didn't have time to read it. It was a waste of effort on his part. As an interviewer, it made me think that he hadn't prepared properly when submitting his application in the first place, and the drastic difference in content made me wonder if he had embellished the new copy. Most interviewers will not take the time to read a new resume during your interview, so do not bother. They will be more focused on hearing you speak than reading.

If you really have no idea which resume you sent them, then bring in your most updated resume and only offer it if they do not already have a copy handy. Most interviewers will have your resume with them when they enter the room.

**ENERGY**

Do: Show a lot of energy and passion about what you are applying for
Don't: Show too much energy or negative energy about where you are trying to leave

As an interviewer for my team, I am looking for someone that will bring passion and energy to the position I am offering. This would apply to a data entry person, all the way to an electrician. Everyone wants to hire someone that shows passion for what they do and that will want to come in to work everyday. And hopefully by sharing your energy, you will make them WANT to have you there everyday.

If a candidate is very quiet and doesn't smile, I tend to wonder if they even want the position I am offering. I will try to smile back at them or will raise my energy in an attempt to draw out their more excited side. If your energy is too low, I will also ask the question, ""What kind of energy will you bring to the team?"" Some people have caught onto this and will show more excitement, but others have answered this in a monotone voice, and that is when I know that I have the wrong person.

**ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

Do: Give a thorough and precise answer
Don't: Spend 10-15 minutes doing so for each question

I try to give every person at least 60 minutes for an interview, so that I have time to feel them out and answer any of their questions; unfortunately, I have more recently been limited to 30 minutes. That is a very short time in Interview Land. When a question is asked, answer the question thoroughly with details, but keep your answers short. This can be hard, because you want to share all of your knowledge, but the worst thing you could do is drone on and on. I recently had an interview where the candidate kept talking for 15 minutes straight, and it was to the point that I couldn't remember the question I asked. And at the end, she couldn't either!

If you find yourself forgetting the original question, you have gone too far. Instead, if your answer is multifaceted, give the high-level answer and then offer to provide details if they would like more information. As an example, if someone asked me how to make a Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwich, I would advice them that I would prepare my work area, collect the ingredients needed, make my sandwich, clean my tools, and then put my sandwich on a plate for consumption. I would then offer to give more detail if they wanted more than this.

**ASKING QUESTIONS**

Do: Prepare a list of questions
Don't: Turn the tables on your interviewer

Always prepare a list of questions to ask during interviews. It shows the interviewer that you are curious about working there and that you invested time in your potential future there. Sometimes I had inadvertently answered the candidate's questions before they have a chance--and that's ok. When you are asked if you have any questions, say something to the effect of, ""I had a list of questions, but you answered my question regarding X, Y, and Z already.""

When I say ""Don't turn the tables on your interviewer,"" I mean that you shouldn't ask questions of your interviewer that they may ask you. For example, I interviewed someone in the past that wanted to know about what I did at the job, what I liked and didn't like, and what my 5 year goals were. These are interesting questions, and I didn't mind answering them, but it changed the mood of the interview so that we left on an awkward foot. If the hiring manager will be your direct manager, you can ask them what their expectations are, or perhaps what would prevent you from getting the position, but keep it at surface level questions (expectations, pay/benefits, hours of operations, etc). A fun question I like to be asked is what a typical day looks like.

For my nervous friends...

If you tend to get nervous and forget things, as some people do (myself included sometimes), write down your questions or any ideas that you want to make sure you hit. This again shows that you are prepared and spent time doing so, and it will help to jog your memory when your adrenaline is racing.

1497,3bknff,False,[advice],1,I learned the hard way... Interview Advice / RANT,jobs,"I'm an Art Director/Graphic Designer in New York City, arguably one of the most competitive arenas in the biz. After applying for a position, 1st, 2nd and then 3rd interview, meeting over 10 people in the company, touring the office, yada yada... I didn't get the job. 

I learned quite a few things in the process and after living the disappointment, here I am, here's what I learned (from feedback and self reflection): 

- The interview process is a game, and a competition of sorts. There are other people in it to win it! Don't let your guard down, and don't get comfortable. The moment you begin to get cocky, feel like you have the job, feel like you are winning and think you are getting positive feedback, you need to SLOW YOUR ROLL. All those intuitions may be true, but until paperwork is signed, nothing is final. 

- Be honest, but tell them what they want to hear at the same time. I mean... you need to work on phrasing strengths, weaknesses, fears, excitements in a way that is professional and appealing.  

- Make sure you KNOW the position and all the duties before you go into an interview! This will help SIGNIFICANTLY. You can even rephrase some of the requirements as items you are skilled at. Do not ever walk into an interview without clear expectations, otherwise you are walking into a deathtrap of uncertainty. 

- NEVER discuss title or money until they actually offer you a position, and want to know your ""magic"" number. Don't even mention it in passing. A time will come for this, but it may not happen until after 3+ interviews. ** If they ask where you see yourself in the company, never name positions, or titles-- focus on the big picture. 

- Care more about the company than your own needs. Be more interested in the team, office atmosphere, and good work, than your personal gain. 

- Never talk about your personal life unless it is directly relevant. Small talk is perfectly acceptable, but avoid the 3: politics, sex, religion. Don't ever make your social life seem important. Your family, friends, things you do are irrelevant unless they are specifically asked about. 

- Try to always do your interviews in person! Phone, Skype, etc. can skew people's perspective of you and body language is very hard to read! 


---------
And just some of the tough questions I was asked:

1. Where do you see yourself in 3 years?

2. What do you fear the most if you started working here?

3. Have you ever worked with/managed a team?

4. What was your most challenging project?

There were some other discrepancies that popped up while I was reading that entry, but I will reduce this wall of text down to one pressing question referring to this statement:

>Obviously I can’t cover all the facets of a technical interview, especially because these interviews can vary tremendously from one specialty to another and from one industry to another. For example, an interview for a web developer’s position will be quite different from an interview for a help desk position.

As a trained hiring professional, I would agree that a Web Developer is certainly a very different position from Help Desk. However, I also know that they still share a lot of core job competencies that allow them to function and maneuver between those jobs, so the way to *hire* them is not all that different. I wonder, IF two jobs are so irrelevant even within its own field, why would people even want to attempt to give out advice in generality? Knowing that whatever is written can only be applied to this one instance for one position.

I hope you don't take it as an offense to what you're trying to accomplish, but I have not found the answer to this day when all of us are seeing this surge of people who want to give advice because they have held a lot of interviews. I've seen ""job gurus"" who want to charge money for this service, which makes it all the more hypocritical. ",2013-10-07 14:14:51

1511,3aaxxj,False,[advice],1,Real Tips for Getting a Job for Entry-Level Candidates and During Recessionary Periods: Based on Theory that not all interviewers are looking for what's best for the employer.,jobs,"Jobs: you work, they pay. Simple, right? Hardly! This article briefly discusses other intangibles that are exchanged in an employment relationship. It focuses on a particular type of intangible that takes away value from that exchange in favor of an ""intermeddler."" Please read the whole post to understand the theory. The practical tips are at the end of the post. 

At the simplest level, the fundamental exchange between an employer and employee is money for labor. That labor can be further differentiated into physical and knowledge-based efforts. However, far more is exchanged in the employment relationship than this. I am not referring to fringe benefits and health insurance, rather I am referring to the intangibles that permeate the work environment. In most cases, the intangibles are not significant, but in industries or sectors where the supply of employment positions is low relative to the availability of labor, these intangibles become significant. Such a scenario can present itself during recessions as well as for entry-level positions even in a good economy. 

The intangibles can be analogized to economic externalities because they are difficult to isolate, identify, and measure. But anyone with work experience can confirm, based on personal experience, that these intangibles, at least, exist. Quantifying them is another matter and perhaps is a discussion to be had later. Some of these intangibles include, superfluous personality traits as well as social affiliations. To clarify, certain personality traits are supportive of a good working relationship, we know them from job descriptions: cooperative, team player, engaged with colleagues, professional, optimistic. However, others are superfluous because while they may serve the personal interests of the hiring official, they are not needed for the position or for the employer’s needs, such as: interest in a particular cuisine, music, hobby, or political affiliation. We will call these superfluous personality traits as “SPT” for short. 

Next, we have social affiliations that are also superfluous. Some organizations, particularly public or non-profit, expressly disallow favoritism for family members. However, other affiliations such as alma mater, church, social group, regional upbringing, can also influence the hiring official. Generally, these similarities may make it easy for the hiring official to assimilate and befriend the newly, hired human resource, but as far as the organization is concerned these are superfluous vis-a-vis concrete skills, education, and experience. We will call these superfluous social affiliations or “SSA” for short. 

Now that we have discussed the intangibles, I will present a sample scenario. The employer has Need A. Need A requires Skill A, Education A, and Experience A. Each category of ability can have levels of development (say, I, II, III). First, the potential employee ideally should have each ability and next the higher level of development they have the better, faster, and more precisely, they can fulfill Need A.

In an ideal world, the employer would locate the perfectly qualified candidate and pay them the worth of their contributions. But the reality is that organizations are filtered through humans. And humans are not always perfectly aligned with the organization. In these instances, the hiring official may have his or her own needs: fun or reliable subordinates (SPT); or wishes to do do a favor for the country club or neighbor (SSA). These personal needs, when they trump the fundamental Need A of the organization, do a disservice to the organization because the organization hires someone who is not the most optimum for the position and other workers have to accordingly pick up slack for that sub-par person. 

A hiring official that allows his or her superfluous and personal preferences influence the hiring process can be fairly called an “inter-meddler” in the employer-employee exchange. What they are doing is incrementally taking away value from the relationship. 


When the organizational (legitimate) need is very high and those with the requisite skills is heterogeneous (i.e., few candidates are similar) it becomes harder and harder for the inter-meddler to justify hiring an inferior candidate based on the intangible and superfluous traits. However, where there is a seemingly homogenous population, this kind of behavior becomes more difficult to tease out.
Those in entry-level hiring markets who have roughly similar skills as peers are more likely to have experienced this. As well as, recessionary periods when large numbers of people with roughly the same level of ability are looking for work. 

Now for the possibly valuable advice: How can someone who thinks they are facing this situation tackle this problem? 

For one, seek to differentiate yourself from your peers. Become “heterogeneous.” In other words, if you have a particular strength or unique experience in a certain area, look for positions that need and demand that skill. This will make it hard for you to be denied a position by an intermeddling decision-maker. Next, be sure to deeply understand the need of the employer. Remember that even job descriptions are filtered through people and the people may not accurately convey what the employer is in need of. So, understand the industry, the role, the typical duties, and determine for yourself at the end of the day what needs to be accomplished. Next, look at your skills, experience, and education, and objectively and quantitatively enumerate those abilities you have and tie them to the position need. This will drive home that you are a heterogeneous and exceptional candidate that should not be subordinated in favor of another candidate who will not be able to meet the need of the organization. 

On the flip-side: How can an enlightened organization address this potential problem?

It is important to have broad policies that go beyond disallowing family-based nepotism. Additionally, requiring post-interview rubrics that are quantitative and require articulation of concrete skills, education, and experience based reasons with citation will make it challenging for an intermeddler to justify why they want an inferior candidate. In turn, the organization will be less likely to lose value by hiring sub-par candidates and existing employees will be relieved of picking up slack in instances where this happens.

This is obviously one theory based on anecdotal evidence. However, it is food for thought. Think about it, if you have ever found yourself in this type of situation, about the plausibility of this model and whether the intangibles are significant enough to be addressed by an organization.

Over my time of applying for jobs in the past, I have done a few of these so called assessments from Indeed. Personally, I will no longer be doing these, and neither should you. Here’s why. 

The job market is tough enough as it is and people who are applying to jobs day in and day out don’t need to waste anymore of their time. 

If the employer doesn’t see enough value in the applicant’s resume and experience (which also holds their contact information) and decides to automate one of the most important areas of researching job candidates, then that indicates to the job applicant that his/her respective company is a waste of time. 

It’s yet another way of attempting to get something for nothing by companies, which is the only thing that businesses revolve around these days. 

Indeed Assessments are gimmicks used by companies who are not capable of making job hiring decisions based on qualifications and interpersonal communication. 

People are more than happy to answer questions over the phone, in person, or email IF  the employer is willing to invest their time.

E: Can’t forget about the companies wanting you to film yourself answering useless questions and sending the video to them as part of an “interview” (thx to the people in the comments for reminding me)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f9xgar/you_should_stop_participating_in_indeeds_online/,509,The assessments are not great.

This job already rubs me the wrong way, and today was my first day of work after training. The work itself is simple, however it seems mistakes still can be costly.

There are two breaks, and while lunch is provided, you have to work while you eat. On each 15 minute break, you must also move your car, as the business has no parking.

The job seemed run-of-the-mill for my field, a step up from what I usually do, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the interview set off some alarm bells.

The first thing that seemed off is that we would spend a couple hours every day doing development workshops with speakers from around the world. This seems like a massive waste of company resources to do this daily, and a waste of my time as I wouldn't be paid for this time. 

The other thing is that out of an 8 hour day, I'm only paid for 4 of those hours. The pay is okay enough to make up for it, but I'd be paid based on performance; which apparently means I could make anywhere from $600 to $1200 a week, which seems strange.

The last thing is just how unconventional the company seems; in the interview, I was told I would be making six-figures if I stuck around for a year or two (huh??) and the company has apparently grown from 1 to 20 offices in two years of existence.

1552,gfejzl,False,Companies,4,Did I make a mistake in moving for a new job?,jobs,"TL;DR- New job has same job title as old job but they aren’t the same job at all!

A bit of a back story as to why I took the new job is because I needed a change for my mental health. For the past 3 years, I’ve been living in Austin. About 10 months ago, I had a pretty bad sports accident that led to an amputation (think Alex Smith injury if he didn’t recover). Anywell, I wasn’t really trying for a new job, but I got an interview with this company in Tampa Bay for the same position title and pay.


I was a planner with high stress, was frustrated a lot, and ran into more problems that I was more likely to be yelled at for screwing up than being recognized for all the solutions I had for highly escalated problems. But I still loved it as the people there were awesome and I did like that it challenged me. All my coworkers were my friends in and out of work, I had more of a mother/son relationship more than an employer/employee relationship with my boss, and half the group was my age (26M) which might’ve made things there more tolerable.


Even during the interview, I kinda got the sense this wouldn’t be the same position after some of the questions I asked, but I figured it might’ve been because my former company is pretty backwards in terms of their processes. And I wanted to give them a shot.


I just started my new position this week and it’s not the same position despite the title. My old position had me making semiconductors and having to coordinate between finance, PM’s, engineers, logistics, manufacturing and purchasing, having to review BOM’s, look for parts and just find solutions to weird problems. I felt like I was playing human chess coordinating 30 different moving pieces to get my tools built on time, or an armchair QB. At my new position, I’m doing none of that. I’m basically stocking up line side/bulk parts to the manufacturing floor and ordering new parts like AA batteries and smocks and gloves and power tools. While I get that this stuff has to be ordered, it just seems weird that someone (me) has to manage that whereas my old place was just ordered.


And a lot of the stuff I’m supposed to be doing are things we had logistics people, Material Coordinators and purchasing departments for. Mind you both are fortune 100 companies and this current company is in aerospace and defense... And I wouldn’t mind it so much except for my disability. I’m not close to the MFG floor or some of the stock rooms or even the parking lot so I have to constantly move. And being an above knee amputee take 2x more energy to walk 2mph... I don’t mind walking every once in a while, but I’m usually physically drained and can barely get to my car by the time I leave. Like, I took the job thinking I’d be a planner for like a tank or building the next line of space shuttles/rockets for NASA; not a glorified stockroom gatekeeper.


At least in my old company, I learned a bunch of things from all the different departments which helped me be better and could see myself trying many different jobs, and I could see myself becoming an engineer or a project manager (Which is my goal by the time I’m 30). I don’t think I’m giving my new company a fair shot as I literally just started. There’s nothing bad to say about any of my new coworkers so far and my supervisor seems really nice, but I don’t see near the same growth opportunity, if there is any, in my current position.

I routinely hear from clients that some of my co-workers told them completely wrong information about our programs. I actually got cursed out today by a client who'd been told one thing by a co-worker only to have me tell her something completely different. I always verify any information with my boss, but it's clear that my co-workers (most of whom work at a different location) don't do the same. I'll tell my boss about these issues without dropping names, and at our monthly meetings she'll go over what's right and what's wrong. The problem? Nobody ever seems to remember what she says at these meetings, and the same problems happen all over again.

My boss herself is disorganized; she never remembers what she did or didn't train/tell us. Occasionally, she'll come up to me and go ""Hey, did you complete this project I told you about last month?"" She NEVER tells me about these projects before they're due. At first, I'd thought I'd just forgotten, but I consider myself to be a pretty decent organizer/planner, and after the fourth or fifth time this happened, I assumed that I wasn't to blame. 

Some of my co-workers have started calling/messaging me whenever they have questions, which is fine; I've made it clear to them that they can.

Has anyone had a positive experience with a company with a lot of bad reviews?",jobs,"They all cite similar things, sound like different people, and HR has clearly put up one or two positive reviews but it's overall negative. Like, one star reviews negative. It's weird to me because you think HR would put up more fake reviews. However despite this, I already went to the training and recently started this job. 

I'm thinking a few things. I think a lot of what these people are saying is *true* but that doesn't really mean it's a bad company if that makes sense. As in, this is a retail-type position so there's inherently always going to be a lot of negative reviews right? On top of that this company only recently entered the market in my country so there's going to be some growing pains in terms of management and organizational structure. I'm wondering if these reviews might be a mix of lack of voice from the positive employee experiences (because they're newer) and maybe fake reviews from competitors astroturfing mixed in because they're a threat to their market. I know they might mostly be real reviews but I'm hoping it's mainly lot of people who just weren't suited for retail. Like I've worked at McDonald's and some other retail stores and it's not as bad as a lot of my coworkers would complain about it. It seems like some people are just not cut out for retail and retail nets a lot of people who are likely to have a bad experience. Sometimes the work experience can be really dependent on the specific team too. I just looked up one of the companies I've recently worked for and it has a much higher rating than I'd expect judging on how rough the store was (it's probably the only retail experience where I genuinely thought it was bad). I might just be doing a bunch of mental gymnastics though here to justify my choice to work here.

I'm just kind of scared and looking for advice or positive experiences if anyone has any to share. It's my first time working in the role I have and there's more responsibility on me than I've had in previous jobs. It's very attractive in terms of benefits and pay, and I think it'll look good on my resume due to the title although it's not at all related to my degree. I just wanted a stable job like this because I've been unemployed for months. There's so many negative reviews online but the team we have seems to be alright. Yes, there is almost constantly work that needs to be done and the hours are crazy right now but it's not *a bunch of one star reviews* bad imo. Then again I've only been here for less than a week.

Typically, industries in which people work 12 hour days are pretty fast-paced, so this doesn't add up.

Banked vacation time is a liability on the balance sheet. If all of the employees at the company take a vacation day it will decrease the liability by a significant amount. Think of what you get paid in a day. Think of what everyone in the company gets paid for a day. The total accrued vacation liability falls by the total amount of what everyone gets paid for that day.

On an overall level that will make the company much stronger financially. That will make it easier for your company to get financing or to get better rates on their financing.  

It's a really small individual sacrifice. Taking a vacation day when you hadn't planned to. 

If everyone works together you will really be doing a good thing for your company.

Started my current job in November and was given an excellent description of the commission scheme, sales structure and how to really succeed as an outbound sales rep.

 
A week after my start date all the above was announced to be restructured for all colleagues as of January 1st. 
 

Previously we would receive commission on all units sold/hired and would even share commission/points with other sales reps from the supplying branch if we send out the quote.

 
They’ve now changed it to require us to hit 60% of a target to receive any commission at all. If I get 59% I get £0. If I get 61%, I will receive 61% of my commission. If I was due to receive £1000 in commission, I will get £610 for that month. This would be fine as it drives people to work harder…

 
However,

 
We work in regions by postcode/zip codes. I manage 6 very busy areas of the UK surrounding London and was told are “prime areas that generate a lot of revenue”.
For some reason that is beyond me; the company has now started to assign accounts as a single point of contact. Meaning that somebody in Scotland can be managing an account in Wales. The product will come from the Wales depo but all communication will be to the Scottish sales rep and will randomly throw these around however they see fit. 
 

Now on top of that they also allow sales people in our head office to manage ANY AREA of the country and get dibs on new accounts for the first 3 months (even if I have generated the business). So, if a customer is 5 minutes from our depo, the sales person at head office who does not know the area, do not know the customer, do not have free range of selecting prices will be able to STEAL OUR SALES. Freely. No real restrictions to it. Even if I have done all the leg work to win that contract. 
 

I’ve worked in sales for a number of years and I’m all for a bit of competition, but I’ve never experienced such blatant neglect towards the sales people putting in the effort with customer to generate new business. So long as the bosses get units out. 
 

Opinions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f98h5o/new_job_isnt_going_great/,6,This seems like they made the changes for very specific reasons that they haven't made anyone aware of. To me it sounds like they are trying to downsize the sales team by having them basically fight it out and at the same time generating revenue.

They praise work-life balance and say they value their employees, but then I get in trouble for taking a lunch and am shamed into working overtime. The office environment is really awkward in my opinion because you either just say ""how's it going"" or you avoid eye contact when you pass each other. Socializing or having conversations seems to be frowned upon. Needless to say it is not a good work environment for me.

My company is running tight on work for everyone and so now to get your guaranteed hours, you would work Sunday-Saturdaly.

It is seasonal, but I am hoping to stay on after the season is over. Here's my problem though. My fears. I have never had a hard time doing customer service. In fact, I have been so good at customer service that I have been a go to person because I am so extroverted and friendly. My customer service comes from my empathy and being able to understand where people come from and never trying to rip them off or do anything untrustworthy. I have had countless people tell me to my face how good I do and how much they appreciate me, some even writing letters and telling previous bosses how I was the only reason they come to the business. But, then there is the other end of the dream, the nightmare. Every place I have ever gone there are bosses or employees who hate me. No matter how hard I work or what I do, they always find ways to get rid of me. And I know it's my personality. I have spent so many times in rooms, just numb as some supervisor tells me I just am not a fit for their company and they have to part ways. I always leave the room just dumbfounded. I am always on time, even early, I always make the customer happy, I sell and make goals, I go beyond and above, yet it never is enough. But, the person who doesn't make an effort and lacks social skills will be always put on the work schedule and given the hours and will never be in trouble. Is being outgoing and friendly a threat to my fellow employees. Am I some sort of target because I must stick out due to my customer service. I want to continue working, but I don't want to keep getting fired over and over again. Has anyone else who is outgoing come across this?

Is this a common practice for many companies, or is this another way to say ""Sorry, we don't want you but will keep your resume on file"".

The reality is that Employee Selection is a critical part of organizational development, so it doesn't make sense for a company to not have the wherewithal to handle it, or believe they will always do it badly. It's like avid marathon runners outsourcing their shoe-tying to somebody else, because they don't have the time to do it themselves or believe they wouldn't tie a knot well. If they want to run, this is one of the basic things they need to do.

The problem is that companies didn't equip themselves with an HR that contained knowledgeable professionals who were trained to do hiring. Selection is totally a part of HR's wheelhouse, but most of the field is still comprised of old guards who got the position by being nice and know how to handle a payroll spreadsheet; and they gatekeep professionals from entering through arbitrary networking tactics. Companies could've easily onboarded someone with an HRM or related degrees, maybe certified, but definitely have expertise in organizational development; but they are stymied by the current HR Manager/Generalists who believe they won't be able to do the job effectively because reasons.

At the very least, the company doesn't have executive leadership that are well-versed enough about this. So they have no idea any of this is happening. Then, the only conclusion is to outsource their recruitment and selection efforts to third-party vendors like Staffing Agencies and Recruitment Firms, believing they are getting a 1:1 replacement with a talent acquisition professional. Like many comments have mentioned, these companies are ironically bleeding money because these firms aren't using sound methodologies to hire effectively, and they're sacrificing an already limited budget or competitive compensation because these agencies need to take their cut from somewhere.

My name is Phil and I have been a retail worker for a big company for the last 6 months. I am paid the minimum amount and working full time. I never really asked any questions because I am not very experienced with working yet (I am 19). People tell me I am good at my job, one of the best where I work and I'm glad. 

However, my new colleague told me that I am severly underpaid for the amount of work I do in the store. Basically I do most of the stuff myself and my other coworkers don't take the job seriously, using their phones while supposed to be working. My manager is always looking for new people to replace them, but very few people want to work there and my coworkers are using this at their advantage. I think am someone who is very loyal, which is why I didn't look for something else all that time. 

I am starting to slowly hate my job here because I do a lot alone. I hate the fact that other coworkers are paid way more than I am while doing almost nothing. I work 40 hours a week at 12$ an hour. 

With Black Friday and the Holidays coming up, I would feel bad quitting and I don't think it would be good for any future job, but showing up every morning and doing the job that wasn't done while I was gone is excruciating.

Loyalty is earned my friend. If a company or small business treats you well, Pays you what you are worth and makes an effort to make their employees lives even a little bit better then you can place your loyalty not in the company but in those around you. If your boss is a great guy, Gives you all the opportunity he can provide, Understands day to day problems that sometimes require absence from work and so on. Then you can place your loyalty in him.

&#x200B;

Companies are not built for employees happiness. They are built to exploit people for profit. This model has worked well over time but at the cost of quality of life.

Being so young I would give this advice I give every youngster. Speaking from experience. I hate my work life and am actively trying to replace it. I just wish i realised all these things sooner.

* If you working harder than what you are being paid for. You are losing money.
* If you feel like you are being exploited then you probably are.
* Working harder than those around you won't do you many favours in the long run.
* Work requiring low skill or just an able body is never rewarded well.
* Loyalty placed in companies is misplaced
* If there is little room to move up the chain, Don't exert more energy than needed.
* You will always hate your job after a while and dread coming into work.
* Use your free time wisely, Don't waste your youth working 40 hour weeks for little reward
* Retail is a horrible industry
* Ask for a pay rise when you want it. Don't be a pushover, More money does not come without asking.
* Working diligently to make someone else more money that they pay you is an exercise in futility and should be limited.
* Look at starting a business.
* Picking a career immediately puts a hard cap on your potential earnings. You will only ever be paid so much.
* Business has a no real cap on potential earnings.
* Depending on your personality type you may find structured organisations relentless and disheartening.
* Anyone who tells you they enjoy their job and isn't a marine biologist or doing some other cool shit is lying to you and themselves.
* There are better jobs out there. None of witch will fulfil you, most of them are horrible grinds design to squeeze the life out of you.
* Don't take your boss to seriously.

Did I forget to mention, the higher you are paid the worse life gets and the less time you have? This is the rule for employment, There are exceptions but you are not likely to be one of them. Higher pay does not mean better quality of life. I know from experience. Being on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week is not worth the money.

My take: Take the reviews on Glassdoor with a grain of salt - the reviews you see are either fake reviews (as in employees coerced or enticed to give positive reviews) or people who are so pissed (either because they were fired or because they had a bad manager) that they leave a negative review which may not represent the organization as a whole.

My advice: Talk to people working in the organization, if possible. Use additional sources of information about the company like:

* Newspaper articles
* Google reviews/google searches
* Reports on the company's website like financial reports

My experience

* There was an MLM company that invited me to a job interview and it turns out that the company tends to invite unemployed people and sell them credit cards! Google reviews saved me on that one.
* A friend tried to recruit me into WFG - an MLM - [and the reviews on Glassdoor are great](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/World-Financial-Group-Reviews-E148185.htm)!
* I worked at an organization that sucked but the reviews were great because employees who had been in the organization for a long time were encouraged to write reviews. Unfortunately, new and younger employees had a very different experience of the company.
* I got a job offer from a great organization, but I was hesitant because of some negative reviews.

\-manpower supervisor

\-service group leaders

I can imagine there are 10,000 reasons why people don’t hire olds, but are any of them actually true, and to why extent, and how does that compare to any benefits, etc.?

When I used to interview, I’d pretty much give an automatic thumbs down or lukewarm reception at best to anyone who was ‘old’ — which was prob 30+ at the time. The reason? I didn’t want any pikers — I wanted someone who was going to sell their soul/sanity/health to the company for 80+ hours per week, and olds had families and just myriad other things in their lives.  

OK that was my personal experience as a hiring person. Now I’m on the other side of 40. Justice! 😂

But take for instance IBM — they fire everyone over say 35. Kind of Nazi-style — hey, they have the experience! 😂

But why is it so important for them to do this?

I imagine it’s straight economics for them — fire the 40yo making $80k hire the fresher making $40k, done.

That’s no small difference.

But what about new hiring? Are young kid always better than olds? Or is just a combination of things you get with young people?
* compliance/desperation
* cheaper labor 
* pliability 
* less expensive health care 
* prettier
* willing to work longer hours 
* smarter/sharper
* better versed in newer tech
* better attitude

Yeah wow that’s a lot.

I would generally agree with all that, but I wonder if there is an actual argument for keeping at least some old people on staff.

Like, older people with relatively inexpensive salaries in key positions could actually help a company more than a bunch of freshens?

It has been a family owned company for 80 years (since the 1940s). Unfortunately, the owners have had health problems (stroke and mental problems). We are a profitable company that supplies a niche apparel product. We are still gaining new customers, creating new designs, and etc. We have several patents. We own two manufacturing plants in Central America. I work in the stateside distribution center (located here for 30 years).

Today we had a meeting with this information provided. The company have four potential buyers. They are optimistic about them. They have been trying to sell for years but the owners were only interested in investors not a large competitor buying. All four companies interested are smaller than ours. Two are in the same apparel as ours. One sells a product that is a direct competitor. Some have distribution centers, some have manufacturing plants but in Asia.

Management seemed positive but management is also older and closer to retirement. They are also less expendable. They said a lot of stuff (they have always presented the company as a whole, this will help the company grow, the companies interested are ""good people"", etc) but it is hard to tell if it is just corporate speak or not. They are in the ""due diligence"" part of the sell.

I have a Bachelor's but it is in Special Education. The town I am living in is **very** small and in the Midwest. I bought a house last year and am going to be paying that off for the next 20 years. I am a naturally pessimistic person so this is stressing me out.

I have queries/complaints and am unsure if they're legitimate or not. Number 1 is the one that really grates me

1. **Pay**

The company I work for does not process our payslips- in order for us to have our payslips and tax deducted, we have to pay an external payroll company 10% from our own wages (capped at £70 a month) this is something that really annoys me as another colleague who works fewer hours, will pay less to get their payslip even though they're getting the same service.

a)is this legal/allowed and am i technically ''employed'' or ''self employed''?

b) can I claim this payment back as an expense?

c) isnt this the agencies responsibility?

&#x200B;

2)**Breaks**

The company enforces a no breaks policy for shifts which are less than 6 hours. story time: I was working a shift from 11:30am-6:30pm, from 11:30-3 I was standing in heavy rain (wearing only a branded t-shirt and trousers with an umbrella) I had not ONCE left my spot to go to the bathroom or sat down. 2 of my colleagues went on a lunch break and a 3rd went to the toilet. the client then comes out and sees me stretching and calls the CEO of the company, who comes down and tells me ''the client says that you're doing \*\*\*\* all'' obviously stunned, I didnt say anything but was seething for the rest of the day-and wrote a strongly worded message to my manager (diplomatically saying that the CEO is a idiot)

I have also had to take a drinks break in the past as i was feeling lightheaded and close to the point of fainting, and had a staff checker saying its not allowed.

&#x200B;

3) **cancellation/returning items**\- the company also enforces a policy where if you're unable to attend a shift (e.g illness), you'll be fined £60, however, if you give enough notice that you'll be unable to attend because of an interview/hospital appointment, along with failure to return items-such as branded t-shirts/leaflets

Any time anyone takes a day off (which happens every week due to family needs) the team is over worked trying not to drown in the amount of work to do. When he takes a day off, he returns to around 200 email, 15 voicemails, 5-10 issues that are on fire, and 3-4 issues that have blown up with his name on it and has to figure out what department didn’t follow protocol. Other departments seem to dump their agendas on them as well to figure out.

A month ago, I was working and one of the customers I got to talk to is in a very good position in another bigger company. So I asked him if they were hiring. He immediately gave me his email adress and told me to send him my CV. Did that during my break and got no reply. 

Didn't get my hopes up since that company usually hires people who are really close to each other (x's son, x's brother, etc). In other words, it's kinda difficult to get in, but they are building a new plant nearby so I took a chance.


The main thing here is, the day before yesterday I was working (we cannot carry our mobile phones with us, safety measures and bla bla bla). So I take my break, check my phone, and see a missed call from a number I don't know. I googled it, and the name of such company appears everywhere. 


What I did was call them but no one answers, it doesn't even give me the option to leave a message.
In my country we have a long holiday period starting from yesterday to next Monday... so I was wondering if I should call them again and try my luck or wait it out until Monday and see if I get a call.

What do you think about this situation? Could it be possible it's them? There wouldn't be any other reason to call me than to at leeeeast try to hire me?

I started this position about 5 months ago and it's been fine so far, nothing special but it's the highest paid job I've had so far (I'm 25).

Anyways, my working hours are 8:00 - 4:30 (I am supposed to take a 30 minute lunch, but I usually just end up working while I eat). Even before and after I get home from work, I am still responding to some work emails on my phone (which I'll count on my time sheet even though I am **salaried**).

When I got into work today, my boss told me that 'things are all about perception' and has asked me to stay until at least 5, if not longer. He then went on to say that a new (as in started 3 weeks ago) business development 'higher-up' noticed that me leaving at 4:30 just means that I am apparently not busy enough... Even though I have great time management skills and am able to do all my work in the allotted 8 hours while at work.

I was then asked if I could start working 9 - 11 hours every day, and then asked me to start taking on more responsibilities (I just checked out my job description (I can find it on our ATS, and the job description is only about 50% of what I actually do).

So not only do they want me to work 3 extra hours every day, just for ""perception"", they also want me to start doing way more than what I was originally told I'd be doing. So I'm not very happy.

I know that I've only been here for 5 months, but it would be outlandish for me to ask for some kind of raise, right?

I recently accepted a position at a company that is not doing so well. This is my first position after College/Internship. Its been a little over a month, and there have been a couple of red flags.

-Constant replacement of CEOs in the last four years. I wanna say 4-5 different ones.

-A majority of managers and supervisors in my department haven't been employed with the company for more than a couple of years, if that. Our  director has been with us for six months. Other positions vary from region to region. I keep hearing a couple months in the higher level positions.

-Many of our regional leadership are leaving the organization. In my area alone we've lost major HR leaders and managers. Even my direct boss is leaving, which worries me even more because they were heavily involved in creating my position.

-Talks of selling to competitors. I've been hearing rumors that the organization is looking to sell, though it has not been successful getting fair market value. Even if they do sell, I could be laid off due to the fact that other companies outsource positions similar to mine.

-Closures, layoffs, and loss of business. Facilities have been losing many contracts, and thus have had to layoff staff and close smaller facilities.

I am not looking to quit. I am really getting into my role, and I even received praise from many of my leaders.

I am not sure what to do if I end up losing this job in the near future. My job search was a very tiring experience. I did do some research, but there wasn't anything that made me want to not accept the role.

1691,axlsuq,False,Companies,10,[HELP] Let go from my job due to 'budget constraints' - 2 months later the company wants me back!,jobs,"So in early January, I was let go from my training position (a few weeks before my pay was legally due to rise), they used the typical 'we don't have the budget' excuse, which I didn't buy for a second. It was a job I worked my ass off in and got really good at, the entire team was dependant on me covering their shifts so they could travel and visit clients. Because it was an intern type position, It took me a 9-12 months before I really started to gain the knowledge and call the role my own, the company didn't really put a big effort into training me - I self taught the functions of the software myself. 

So they threw away all the experience I gained and will now have to train another person from scratch now that they've gotten rid of me. This was all probably because I would have cost them a little bit more, so they'd rather bring in a new trainee instead of paying me a bit more. They probably could afford it, but saw the opportunity to save a quick buck.

A week or two later when looking for a new job, I see my old position being advertised on a job board, the closing gate kept on getting extended and extended by a few weeks every time. I can only presume this is because they couldn't get to replace me with.

Fastforward to yesterday, I get an email from my old boss - saying they want me back and are willing to offer me the full time job that I didn't get last time. Pay is okayish but isn't the best, the company isn't that big and so doesn't really pay people that well in general.

Thoughts? I've been applying for two months now for equivalent but much higher paying trainee jobs that I'm qualified for, some with huge companies. Should I accept the offer or keep plugging away?

**Tl;DR: Company let me go, thinking they could cheaply replace me with another trainee. That plan appears to have failed, and now they want me back full time.**

They got me in there by saying they had something “perfect” for me and they could match me at 14.50$ hour ,

Now , their “clients “ can’t match my rate and they want me to basically start telemarketing at 8am to 5pm in their office as a “junior recruiter “

Today I slept past my alarm bc we lost electricity last night . I have to be honest I don’t feel so bad bc they haven’t been consistent . 

My friend went to a different agency and she said she got the similar run around . They didn’t have the jobs they said in the interview. But they could use her “internally”

1711,9s7ezl,False,Companies,16,Working job for roughly 3 months. Company lied about literally everything.,jobs,"Lets start here:

I've worked in this field (information technology) for awhile now. From programming (nothing fancy moved to network admin because I didn't like it much) but mostly as a Network admin.

I found a job while unemployed (last job didn't fire me, the company closed) so in the mean time I decided to look for work. Well over 1000 applications all around my area and I got one hit.

Job description: 17-25 dollars an hour depending on certs, experience, and education. Network administration (right up my ally.) Come in to the first interview: 

""Well we don't have the capacity for network administration just yet, but that's what you will become in about 60 days from starting. We are looking for experienced people."" 

""Ok, that's acceptable, will I need to build the network?"" 

""Nope.""

Went into my second interview. Got told ""you are hired."" First day I was told everything I was told up to this point was a lie. I would be paid 12.5 an hour if I accepted. I told them I wouldn't take it for less than 16, they told me ""Ok we offer 15 or leave. There is no room for advancement as that is the cap out pay for this position."" I asked about the job being a network admin job or becoming that ""Nope won't happen."" I took the job mostly because I needed something to hold me over. In my area the standard is staying at a job for at least 6 months before quitting or you won't find work even at a gas station, so now I'm stuck here.

Currently this position has hired 6-7 people, every single one is over qualified. Since staring they have changed our title 3 times: Network Admin -> Network Helpdesk -> Technical Call Center Associate.

This has really *REALLY* gotten under my skin. I'm at my half way point with this company towards 6 months. Now one saving grace this place has is the following: We don't do much of anything. Perday I'm taking about 10-15 calls, this takes me roughly 5-20 minutes a call. So there is a lot of free time to do nothing.

Well now this place is pushing us writing SOP's for network administration. I'm simply not going to do it tbh. I don't care. You want SOP's for network administration out of me? Pay me 21 dollars an hour and I'll make those SOP's for you. They are now pushing us using network administration tools but refusing to increase our pay. I'm simply not going to use them. I'm just not going to fucking do it. You want me to act as a network admin? Pay me as a network admin.

We work with helpdesks around the world, and all I can say is they are the most incompetent helpdesks I've ever worked with. Several in the English speaking world and they are no better either. If I pass clients or internal people to them, the people at those help desks will scream at me, and the client. Why? Even if its for their helpdesk they will scream. I literally had one guy on the phone screaming that he wouldn't do any work because he just didn't feel like it.

This company doesn't follow any industry standard. Not around security, or how a helpdesk should be structured. I've tried brining this up multiple times (I could build a helpdesk that runs more efficiently with 1/3rd the people this one has in a few hours.) My supervisor has brought the same things up to our management and they refuse to listen. Bare in mind this is a multi-national company with quite literally millions of clients. We get fishing phone calls daily.

Now lets get to my counterparts: Most of them either have one, or multiple degrees in this field, several certifications, and more experience than me. Two run side businesses that the company is now asking them to close to which they said ""nope. Not going to happen.""

One of the supervisors who have nothing to do with us has been actively complaining about how 'little' we do. He complained that all we do is look at facebook (Sorta true, but the only reason everyone at this desk hasn't walked out is because we don't do much. Everyone here is way overqualified.)

All I know is I will have two more certifications before I leave this place and I'm absolutely stunned at how this place manages to make any money.

So seriously what the fuck? Has anyone had this experience before?

TL;DR redux: ""We need network admins but no budget, hire them as helpdesk and insist they act as a network admin. Just lie through your teeth to get these people.""

My position is new to the company,  the duties were handled by consultants.   Small Company, very old school approach towards manufacturing. 

I have 10 years in my Niche (QC) manufacturing experience and 5 of those as management. Along with an additional 5 years of Military (QC) experience and a few QMS Auditor certificates.

Here it goes:
So I was recruited for my current position, diners, drinks etc. for almost four months.  Which during this time caused me to mentally checkout at my last company.  When I was finally presented the offer it didn’t thrill me, but I reluctantly accepted.  

First 90 Days have come and gone, and I am still not impressed.  

I started as a team player, introduced myself,  gave my background etc.  Asked other members of management to let me know how I can add value to them and the team (where would they like me to insert myself not to step on their toes) Everything went really well for the first two weeks.

About the mid of my third week we had an issue appear and they asked for my opinion. So I gave my opinion (systematic failure) got dirty looks and quickly ended with “its real easy for me to say this because I wasn’t here when this happened and don’t know any of the specific details.. it’s a completely unbiased view of the situation.”  After this majority have given me the cold shoulder. 

After 30 days I had a 1:1 with my boss (VP) typical review until I asked strategic planning question, which appeared to offend him. I haven’t actually communicated with him in 60 days. Not by my choice, I’ve emailed, I’ve left voicemails, I’ve texted and seen that he has red the text (thank you read receipts) and  I’ve  physically attempted (multiple occasions) to talk but am still “ghosted”..

The president belittles my experience and certifications. Things have gotten better after a few discussions but still annoying.  

In general I feel majority of the staff is just lazy, the type that complain about being busy but take long breaks and lunches and then surf the internet in between those breaks and lunches.  

3 of 4 payroll deposits have been incorrect (under paid)... corrected when I question.

I am trying to remain positive that this is just a “initiation” test,  but I seriously dread going to the office.

This agency contacted me when I was looking for temp work, offering a role similar to the job I'd just left. The only problem was it was a few towns over, and I knew from experience that traffic heading into that town could be bad. I voiced my concern with that but the rep was saying 'oh no, that'll be fine. Anyway, can I make the appointment for 10am next Wednesday? I'll send you the job overview and interview prep.Thanks!'

He sent a few bullet points for the job description. No interview prep, no description of the company, nothing. Usually you'd at least get a 'these are links to the company' information. I looked that stuff up on my own and realised that the company was on the opposite side of the town. So to get to it, I'd need to go through the one way system in the town, which at rush hour can take a good half hour on it's own. On top of that, the job description was well above anything I'd done before, more then I was qualified for at the time. I'd had an interview offer for a job that was closer to home and much more suitable.

I called the guy the following day (Friday) and got his voicemail. Ok, fine. I left a message saying that I didn't believe the job would be suitable, gave my reasons, and confirmed that I wouldn't be attending the interview. I also emailed him just in case.

He didn't respond until the Tuesday, when he called at 6pm to tell me it was unprofessional to not attend an interview. I replied that I'd told him with a few days notice and my reasoning. He just huffed and ended the call.

1743,gia52w,False,Recruiters,12,Is it ok to connect to the recruiter on LinkedIn?,jobs,"Hello!!!

Hope all is well with you in this uncertain times.

**Context:**

I received an e-mail on last Friday (8 May) by a recruiter from the retail fashion division of a big company in my country.

They have several business areas, and I applied to opportunities in the food retail division (supply chain and logistics), and by that contact, the recruiter from the other fashion division said in the email that wanted to call me soon, to know my interests and motivations, if it made sense.

As soon as I read the email (end of the day in friday 2hours later), I sent a response thanking for the contact and showing availability to talk about that, and if preferable for them, i was available to arrange a given time to expect a call!

I didnt receive till now a response from the recruiter and at this point I don't know what to do. I searched the recruiter profile in LinkedIn and found it, it has the premium version so later the person will know I visited him.

**My doubt is**: is it too wrong in this phase to connect with the person? I found other 2 recruiters from the same division, one with the same function and other with another...

I would like to expand my network since i have <100 connections (most of them with recruiters only), and because its a dream/perfect company to work that I thought I would never get a shot at working with them.

If I shouldn't connect directly with this recruiter that contacted me, then can I connect with the others? Does this makes sense?

I'm desperate to get a job so I can start working and take off my career, it has been a long journey of 1.5 years looking for a job (while I work in part-times) that meets my profile and wishes for a future career in management related to supply chain **or** sales&marketing.

I know when we are a young graduate you shouldn't narrow too much your options, but I felt confident that would eventually find an opportunity in this fields in the retail sector...

Assuming a recruiting firm, remember how these people get paid.  The hiring company pays them a very large fee if they successfully find a candidate that they hire.  Some recruiters do a lot of fishing for candidates when they don't actually have many roles available, to expand their network and so that they have lots of candidates ready to go when a role does arise, that they can pick and choose from.

That said it's a good idea to maintain relationships with them.  They may or may not have good openings right now.  They are often eager to talk to you if you have some experience in the fields they focus on, so it's a little different than normal interviews, and it doesn't necessarily reflect their likelihood of finding you a job.

Hi, thank you for reaching out!  I'm looking for new opportunities right now and would love to connect.  If you know of any openings I'd be a good fit for, or if you would be open to having a short call to discuss my background in anticipation of future openings, please let me know.

1748,f3j0uy,False,Recruiters,89,"Just a reminder, job recruiters WANT you to get the job. Feel free to ask them for advice.",jobs,"This is only for third party recruiters. Some large companies have recruiters in house, and I'm not talking about that situation.

First of all, recruiters are legit. I thought maybe they were scams since someone contacting me for a job sounded too good to be true. That was a long time ago, and I've dealt with them a lot since then.

A recruiter's performance, and sometimes even pay, is largely dependent on them placing people in jobs. If you get the job, that's good for them as well.

I see questions on here all the time about interacting with recruiters. I'll drop a few notes I've heard/experienced directly from recruiters, but would love to hear other thoughts, and let me know if I'm wrong on any of this.

Ask recruiters about the hiring manager/position/what they're looking for. They'll be likely to give you some good details because as stated above, they're rooting for you. They've also possibly interacted with the hiring manager and have some details that aren't on the application. They might let you know really great details in your history you should mention in an interview.

Feel free to ask about pay. I hated bringing this up in an interview, but a recruiter won't mind. Also this could stop you from undervaluing the position when asked what you want to be paid. Also ask them any details you think might be deal breakers. No reason to spend a bunch of interviews not realizing you're gonna hate a job.

Recruiters are less likely to turn you down for something very minor. They may leave some things out speaking to the recruiter or even critique you.

Once you are out, they won't be afraid to let you know. A couple times I've just been ghosted, but feel free to ask where you are in the process. (again no recruiter is gonna throw you out as a candidate cause you emailed them one too many times)

If you don't want the job, tell them straight up. I don't know why but I used to be nervous about saying this like I was breaking up with someone. They don't want to waste time with someone not interested, so it's no big deal.

Try to keep in touch with them. Add them in LinkedIn or something. I've had them call me back a month later asking if I was still looking.

That's all I can think of.

EDIT: since this is in contest mode, I'm going to put the most common/best comments here since they won't rise to the top. The things I missed on are basically the negative, which exist. I think this is partially because recruiters for someone with 6 years+ experience is different from someone with very little experience.

A lot of recruiters don't look to far into candidates before reaching out. This means they'll contact you with jobs you'd clearly have no interest. Another reason to ask questions (salary) immediately

""They dont want you to get THE job they want you to get A job"" most probably don't care whether it's a good fit on either side which is why you should immediately start asking questions.

They will ghost you. Some (once you've got more experience I'd say) will want to keep in touch cause maybe they'll try again with you later. For some, once you're out of contention, you're useless to them, and they don't seemingly care about their reputation. I've even had an appointment set up and been ""stood up"" (only once)

There are absolutely bad experiences but... it's job hunting. This sub is incredibly negative, and it's hard to blame, BECAUSE job hunting sucks. I'd still say it's slightly less awful than other ways of job hunting.

1749,gsjwv8,False,Recruiters,6,I made a blunder with a recruiter by not realising I had already applied for the job directly,jobs,"Hi

About 20 days ago I was contacted by a recruiter for a role and they asked me if I had already applied and I said no and we went ahead with the process. A couple of days later as I was going through my application records I saw that I had indeed applied that role a day before the recruiter contacted me. I had completely forgotten about this as this company wasn't a big one and I had other companies on my mind. But here is where I really went wrong. Instead of letting the recruiter know as I soon as I realised I decided not to tell her because I assumed the CV I sent directly got lost in a sea of applications. I realise the error in this way of thinking but I just wasn't thinking properly. 

Anyway, I went ahead with the process through the recruiter and it got to the final stage interview. My final interview is on Monday and today I got a call from the recruiter saying they couldn't represent me as the company told them I had applied a day before. 

I feel awful for wasting the recruiter's time and making them look bad in front the company and I feel terrible about making myself look really bad in front of both the recruiter and the company. The recruiter isn't a major one in this country so I'm not too worried that being blacklisted by them is going to cost me a lot of future job opportunities although people's networks can be tight so who knows. And for the company I look foolish and disorganized at best and sneaky and selfish at worst. 

How do I handle this situation? I'm going to go back to the recruiter and confirm that I had applied and apologize for wasting their time.

My manager at the company I work for recently told me that I will be hired directly by the company and he asked me to submit a salary request. I'm not really sure where to come in at, though?

Most of the information I've found online for folks moving from contract to permanent is for 1099 contract positions that offer no vacation, health insurance, or 401k match- and so by moving to permanent + those benefits, you can actually expect a decrease in salary. However- my staffing agency provides me with all of those things already- so I don't see how I could have a reduction in pay as is common in those other scenarios.

My thinking is that my company is likely paying the staffing agency my salary + at least 20%, so if I request my salary +10-15% more, me and my company would both win.

Does that sound like a reasonable approach? Or am I crazy to think I can expect an additional 10-15%?

We want to bring you to 2nd round of interviews. I'll be following up later today with more information. Look for an email later this afternoon asking for your schedule."" Been 2 days since this email and there's been no follow-up. How am I supposed to translate this?

Hi all, new to this sub. Looks like a good one to watch from here on, but came here specifically with the following question:

I've started looking for a new job recently and have started getting a lot of emails/Linkedin messages from recruiters. Not company recruiters, but recruiters that work for a recruiting company if that makes sense. Most of the offers so far are way off and don't at all pertain to me.

However, I have had some that are offering what I'm looking for. One in particular works for a recruitment company, but based on their linkedin profile seems to be tied with the company that she is offering positions for. This company is a big well known company that I would be thrilled to get a job for. I'm following through with the recruiter for the position that they brought to my attention, but there are numerous other positions on that company's website that would fit with me.

In most cases agency candidates are at a disadvantage because they cost 15-20% more than direct applicants due to placement fees. Most internal talent organizations have a mandate to minimize agency spend and in a lot of situations, they don’t actually give the agencies a job - the agencies find the same listing, source candidates and then present them in the hopes that they’ll get approved to work on the search. So at least ask about the relationship with the client, but if they don’t have exclusivity (which only really happens in exec search for full time roles), then make sure you apply before they submit you so that they don’t get credit for the submission and you don’t have to rely on them to negotiate an offer (a major PITA).

1783,fayh0m,False,Recruiters,13,Absolute insane experience with recruiters. Need urgent help,jobs,"I live in Colorado and I've been actively looking for my first big developer job for the past month. I've had multiple interviews and multiple offers.

I narrowed my options down to 2 companies:

1. A contract to hire position with a technology that I'm excited about - via a recruiter
2. A DoD full time position that requires a Secret clearance - via the actual company

My priority was #1 and I've been constantly in touch with the recruiter. After my interview, he said everything is looking great, yet kept stalling on sending out an offer. He stalled for about a week.

While he was stalling, #2 offered me the full-time offer, which I eventually accepted. This role is contingent upon me getting the Secret clearance done, which could take anywhere from 1-3 months. It also seems to be a complicated process.

I called the recruiter and told him that I have an offer on the table and they need to hear back from me soon, so I asked him nicely to update me and try to speed up the process. He said he will.

Here is a timeline:

Day 1 - told the recruiter about the other position

Day 2 - recruiter did not answer phone call

Day 3 - recruiter did not answer phone call

Day 4 - recruiter answered phone call. I asked him about the position. He said it was filled.

Day 5 - I accept the #2 offer.

Day 6 - I find the actual email contact for the hiring manager at company #1 and thank him for his time and ask for feedback. He never replied.

Day 7 - The recruiter for #1 calls me and tells me that the hiring manager got in touch with him and told him that I contacted him. The recruiter then asked me if I would still be interested in filling up the role. I am very surprised. I asked him what happened with the other candidate. He said he might not work out. I ask him to tell me what the offer would entail and he says he will get back to me.

He calls me back an hour later and he said that I MIGHT receive an offer, but it is contingent upon me starting on MONDAY. The next business day. I tell him that it would be a very short time to make a decision and might be difficult to contact #2 and let them know about it.

After all, #2 is a full time position with plenty of benefits. #1 is a company that I was excited about, but it is a contract-to-hire (duration unknown, anywhere from 3-12 months) role. However, #2 could take months until I even start working there if all the paperwork gets done correctly. So here is my conundrum:

\#1 obviously has red flags in terms of its recruiters, but if I actually started on Monday, I can actually have income (I am currently unemployed). It does not seem like a stable position at all, however. I wouldn't feel comfortable rescinding #2, which seems to have a lot of security.

\#2 will probably take months until I can even start working there.

What do I do?

Technically, I could start #1 and get paid and get experience, and quit when #2 is ready. But what if I like it? By that point, #2 would have spent thousands of dollars on me getting cleared and onboarded. I don't think I could rescind #2 at that point. Also, the process for #2 might not take that long.

Do I just play it safe and focus on #2 and getting the process done and hope for the best in terms of the timeline? What if I don't get cleared and waste months without experience and income and miss out on the contract opportunity?

Do I rescind #2 knowing that the recruiters for #1 are shady to say the least and I'm not exactly sure what the actual company is expecting of me ?  The #1 position is also not full time and it doesn't have benefits, but it probably pays the same as #2 in terms of hourly.

1786,gfztdd,False,Recruiters,0,What is working for Hermes actually like?,jobs,"Hi guys,

I live in West Wales and am 20 years of age. I am fully aware that business insurance will be a LOT higher for me until I reach 21 years of age but that's why I'm preparing now as that's in around 4 months time. I am really passionate about driving and am looking to hopefully do something in delivery, but need to be earning a sustainable amount of money. I applied for Hermes once and got a call asking for further details but I never got back to them after doing the sums, it was truly awful. I don't know if it's like this everywhere but based on what I've heard, this is what I can approximate.

Income:

50p per parcel (assume 100 parcels per day, 12 parcels an hour approx means 5 minutes between deliveries, seems about right). That's £50 in income, or a gross rate of £6.25/hr.

Outgoings:

Assume the cost of running a car is 35p a mile. With business insurance, that is roughly what it would be I'd imagine. Where I live, as things are pretty far away from each other (quite rural). I would assume that over 8 hours of driving I'd cover around 150 miles a day, which would mean an average speed of 19mph which seems about right given my experience of driving where I live.

So, 150 miles at 30p per mile, is £45

Total income for 8 hours work = (£50-45) = £5 or... 63p per hour.

I have heard of Hermes SE+, which supposedly you trade in some of your per package income for a stable pay rate. Does that sound any better or does anyone have experience with it? If the income is so bad as I have calculated, why am I still getting deliveries via a hermes courier?

1792,fqgkz1,False,Recruiters,7,I want to renegotiate my hourly pay with a recruiter a month into my new job,jobs,"I have been actively looking for a job a month ago. I was presented with a couple of offers, but I had an interview that I enjoyed that was set up via a recruiting agency.

After my interview, I was talking to my recruiter for 1-2 weeks trying to speed up the process. I got other offers and I told him about them and hoped that he would speed the process up for me to make it easier for me to make a decision. One of the offers was for $36/hr but it required me to relocate, which I preferred not to do at the moment (I did not tell him that I would have to relocate but told him about the pay)

He said that his job pays 36$ as well and that I should just wait a couple of more days.

I then received another offer, for $38, and told him about it. However, I told him that I am still interested in his position because once again, I enjoyed the interview and could see myself as a good fit.

The recruiter ghosted me for a week. Stopped answering phone calls, texts. I had given up.

Eventually, he picked up the phone after a week. He told me someone else had filled that position. I contacted the company that I would work for through the recruiting agency DIRECTLY and the people there told me that they would have been excited to work with me, but they were told that I had already accepted another job offer. 

Two days later. on a Friday, the recruiter called me and told me that I could still get the job if I wanted to. I had other offers on the table but told him that I could still be interested. I told him that I'm willing to entertain a potential offer.

The recruiter told me there was a catch - I would have to accept it that Friday night and show up to work on Monday - which was actually an insane condition. However, I needed a job and needed it fast. I said ""Okay, I'll work with you""

The offer came in at $31. I told him that I was expecting him to keep his word and offer me the $36, but he used the typical recruiter excuse ""It came in lower than I expected"". I know they are getting a huge chunk of what the company is paying for me.

Anyways, I'm a month in and have done an excellent job so far. However, I'm still wanted by other companies - and here's a thing that I saw as a red flag: Even though there is an ongoing pandemic, the company refused to let me work from home even though my job is technical and can be performed remotely. 

I feel like I have nothing to lose and I also feel like I'm terribly underpaid for the tasks that I'm doing.

Can I give my recruiter an ultimatum of keeping his original promise and renegotiating my pay or else I'd be moving on to other prospects?

I would have nothing to lose if I went to a new job. However, the recruiting agency would lose money by losing me, so I feel like it doesn't hurt to try.

I kept applying with no luck, and sent her a follow up email months later restating my interest. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I get an email from her with a direct reply to my follow up email, telling me a spot opened on her team, and that I should apply and that she would flag my resume with internal corporate recruiter. I did, and he emailed me to schedule a phone interview. 

Had the phone interview last week, nailed it, and he told me that the hiring manager (not the director who emailed me, but the lead manager below her) might want to skip the phone interview with me and just bring me in, since his boss (that emailed me and whom I interviewed with last year) already tagged me, and I already interviewed with so many directors of departments that I would be interacting with last year. 

He told me (unprompted by me) that he was speaking with hiring manager on Friday, and that he would reach out to me either Friday or Monday the latest to let me know the interview schedule, as they are moving quickly.  I heard nothing, so yesterday morning I sent an email to follow up, asking for a status update. He never returned my email.

I sent a follow-up email five days later (the recruiter had told me he would call me the next day to arrange a face-to-face and didn’t) then waited another week and reached out on LinkedIn. He never read my message and never replied.

1801,fb5elk,False,Recruiters,4,Question: Working with more than 1 recruitment agency for positions in same company?,jobs,"Hi, hope I used the right flair. I'm in a bit of a dilemma. So first off, I'm not very familiar with working with recruitment agencies so I'm not sure what the usual etiquette is. Omitting some details for confidentiality. **TLDR at the bottom**

&nbsp;

I had my resume and details uploaded to a job board for a while, and a few days ago, Agency A reached out to me and said I seemed to be a good fit for a job, X, at a large company. Note that I didn't apply for the position before Agency A reached out to me. Now this company is... definitely known nationwide, and they're very prominent in their field. 

&nbsp;

I was able to talk with Agency A a few days ago, about the position and other details. For where things are now, Agency A has forwarded my information to the hiring manager of the company, and are waiting to hear back. The next step, if the hiring manager approves, is an onsite interview. Overall Agency A seems to be larger and has been around longer, has more reviews, but seem to be based in a different state.

&nbsp;

But today around the afternoon, I got a call by Agency B... for a slightly different position, but at the same exact company and same location - **However**, at the time I applied, their listing didn't say the name of the company - they just said the location of the position. I applied to the position via Agency B *before* I first talked with Agency A on Wednesday. Agency B is smaller and newer, but unlike Agency A they're local to the general area they recruit for. 

&nbsp;

In my call with Agency B, **that's** when they told me ""The position's at (large company)"". I could've gleaned that from context clues in their listing but wasn't 100% sure. But TBH, I wasn't expecting to hear back from Agency B because I applied through them before and never heard back.

&nbsp;

I googled around and most people are saying that it's not a good idea to have multiple recruitment agencies represent you for positions in the same company... aka double-dipping. The two positions are in the same department I think but not exactly the same, so I'm imagining that the recruiters would be talking with the same hiring manager, which after googling is not a good idea and the hiring manager would likely get confused about who is actually representing me. But since the company is so large, I'm wondering if that would make any difference vs. if it were a smaller company where the hiring manager for sure would be the same?

&nbsp;

I'm just not sure how to proceed with things... do I tell both agencies? Do I stick with one agency and drop the other? AhhHHh. I just don't want to accidentally end up burning bridges with anyone.

**TLDR**:

-Agency A got to me first for the position at a large company by finding my resume through a job board

-I applied to Agency B *before* I talked with Agency A

-I wasn't aware at the time which company Agency B was recruiting for until they called me

-I got a call back from Agency B *after* I already talked with Agency A and got things rolling

-Agency A and Agency B are recruiting for the same exact company

-The positions are slightly different but chances are very high they're in the same department with the same hiring manager

-... What should I do now?

Its not a good idea because in many cases, the company is ""price shopping"".  Not saying this is your case but its not uncommon for a company to take a position and give it to several recruiters and let them beat the bushes.  Often,they are looking for a low bidder. ",2020-02-29 01:52:56
1802,g6o9j8,False,Recruiters,1,Can I look for temporary work while currently signed to a contract?,jobs,"So a little over a month ago, I was contacted by a recruiting agency that said they were looking for someone that was in my field for a new job. I went and did the interviews and got the job. I'm currently still a college student and this was basically like an internship with the possibility of becoming a full time job. I was very excited because I never had a job in my field before. But as of last week because of the pandemic people were furloughed and since I was on a contract for the recruiting agency I am basically just not working any hours and not getting paid because my contract was hourly. The recruiters told me that as soon as we could they would love to have me come back to the position immediately, but I don't know how long that is going to be. Basically my question is am I allowed to apply and potentially get hired for another remote position while I am still signed by the recruiting agency? I would very much like to get back to work as I am incredibly bored and my semester is just about done.

I would suggest being transparent about it but don't worry about the agency as it would be expected that their candidates are seeking other employment when they aren't working.

If it were me, I would start applying and only really mention it once you receive an offer. Just a quick email saying thanks for your help but I would like to back out of this role as I have received an offer. Maybe give them 2 weeks notice in case it picks up and they need you to work, but you otherwise don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!

2. Does it hurt my eventual negotiating position to tell them that they're my first choice, but I'm not interested in the position they're trying to fill?

I’ve only been a project manager for a theatre production so I was wondering if the recruiter might have just not know that when they reached out to me.

I just didn’t want to get my hopes up if he accidentally messaged me, haha. 

It might be worth it to mention that my friend has been trying to start up a company in the space industry as well (company is currently in stealth mode and I haven’t gotten anything in writing yet in terms of employment), so I have experience in spacecraft systems engineering.

1841,f067on,False,Recruiters,2,Is it worthwhile to question job recruiters about potential wage increases?,jobs,"A few months ago I got my first job in the networking field (computer sciences).  I went to school for this, and a week after my final day of class, I started this job, I was hired before I even graduated.  It seemed too good to be true.  A lot of people graduate and are stuck looking for work in their field, I suppose I got lucky enough to have found that quite quickly.  I am thankful for this, and it is experience in the IT field at the very least.

The job I am working only hires people through job recruiters, you can't be directly hired into these positions.  There are multiple recruiting agencies that look for candidates for these jobs, and the one I use is rumored to be one of the better ones (according to coworkers).  Until today, I had never spoken to anyone about their wages, but I have heard multiple other coworkers complain about how low the wages are for this field in comparison to other companies.  I admittedly thought it was low before I was hired, but for entry level, I wasn't going to complain.

Well two of my former classmates were hired to this company, both obtaining the same degree as myself.  However, neither of these two people have any certifications in the IT world, whereas I obtained my CCENT and my CCNA (Cisco certifications.  This is important as we are contractual workers for Cisco), neither of them have experience in the field either.  It comes to find out, they both get paid more than me.  One by a rather insignificant amount, the other by +$4 per hour.  This seems off to me, I studied and paid to obtain certifications whereas the other two have either failed their cert exams, or have yet to attempt them.

When I first applied to this job, all I had was my CCENT.  I was told what my wage would be, and I agreed to it.  Right before being officially hired, I took my ICND2 exam and passed earning me my CCNA.  I figured this might raise my salary slightly, but it didn't.  I was also told that this job only hired those with their CCENT or CCNA certs, but preferred CCNA.  Now I am realizing that that isn't true at all, considering the two people I mentioned obtaining the same position. 

My question is, are job recruiters generally open to the idea of potential wage increases or am I just SOL?  I agreed to the wage offered, and I can't be mad if I am stuck with it.  From what I have gathered from other coworkers (many of which go through the same recruiter as myself), you are kind of stuck with what you get with zero room for advancement.

I responded to a post on LinkedIn last night for a Financial Analyst position and the man that I emailed my resume and cover letter to called me today. He works for Parker and Lynch which is a recruitment service. He made it sound like the position I applied for was not for me (a person fresh out of college with no related work experience) but we did set up an interview anyway so that he could potentially find me a position.

Is a recruiting service the way to go for someone in my position? I'm concerned that it'll basically be a temp agency where they'll match me with clerical work that pays hourly when what I'm after is a career with growth potential. I am also concerned that this service will cost money and, as someone fresh out of college, money is in short supply but I have no problem investing in my future if the opportunities they can offer me are worth it.

Sure!  It's a common misconception to think that recruiters and temp roles are restricted to secretarial type work.  You should not pay them any money to work for them or through their service. Typically, the employer pays the temp agency $X per hour of your work and they pay you a smaller $x per hour.  The temp agency makes money on the margin between what the employer pays them and the lesser amount they pay you.  

These are often project and overflow positions where the big name company doesn't want the expense of on and off boarding lots of people quickly and the liability of legal action resulting from early terminations, worker's comp, etc.  If you have no experience, it would definitely be worth your time and, as you say, investment in your future self, to take a financial analyst position through a temp agency.  Maybe there's a company that is has a seasonal business and needs an extra hand for three or six months.  I'd gladly take that or a few months of project work so that my resume looks great -- plus the people you meet and connections you make can actually put you in long term roles. ",2020-01-14 20:30:55

My program is a 3 year program. I was previously in a 4 year Honours Bachelor of Commerce Program, with a Major in Information Technology. However, I did not like the specific program, and any other Honours program in the Commerce Program, so I recently opted to switch to the General, 3 Year Bachelor of Commerce Degree. After I graduate with the degree, I plan on going to college for one year to pursue a graduate certificate in Information Systems Business Analysis, where there are 3 semesters, the first two being in school, and the third being a co-op placement. My cousin also did a 3 year Bachelor of Commerce Degree, and the same college graduate certificate, and has a nice paying job working for a Fortune Five Hundred Company. So at the end, my degree will say ""Bachelor of Commerce"", and not ""Honours Bachelor of Commerce"" My question to you guys is, in terms of getting hired for a job, am I still good with doing a 3 year degree + College with co-op, rather than doing a 4 year honours degree with no co-op? In other words, do employers care about if the degree is a 3 year or a 4 year one/honours one? Have I made the right decision opting for a 3 year degree + College?

It seems as though in the past couple weeks I have been hit up more than before through linkedin about potential opportunities from recruiters. I work in RE development/construction/design in a medium west coast city. I typically haven't responded to these requests. Is that rude? Since they aren't solicited I don't know whether it's worth responding (read: networking), and the recruiters don't say outright who they are representing. There are companies I would not consider at all and wouldn't want to waste anyone's time. Is there some standard of confidentiality here where I wouldn't find out without directly asking right off the bat?

How do these recruiters go about finding people they message? These messages as of late have been more specific and tailored to specific positions I’ve held or skills I list. 

I am generally happy in my position due to flexibility, work/life balance, co workers and project types, but am also curious about other opportunities and taking on more since I am <4 yrs in the industry. I am particularly curious what others would offer compensation-wise, but it would take quite a bit to consider other opportunities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/epsbaf/linkedin_recruiter_etiquette_and_insight/,1,"Corporate Recruiter here...

Good Recruiters find people mostly via the skills and experience listed on your profile and when we send messages, we will highlight those in the message. Bad recruiters will use the shotgun approach and just sent out a bunch of messages and see what sticks.

If you're happy where you're at, then simply click the ""not interested"" button as that will automatically send a message back for you. From the perspective of the Recruiter, some companies measure how often Recruiters get responses back on those messages so doing at least that is always nice. And it takes roughly 2 seconds.

If you don't want to network you obviously don't have to. Is it a good idea to network? Obviously yes as you never know what is going to happen in the future. If a Recruiter doesn't say what company they're representing in the initial message, you can always ask. If they won't tell you, then just say you're not interested. 

All things considered, these things take a matter of seconds in reality and don't take much effort on your part. And in regard to this statement...

I'm 28 years old I have 8 years of work experience the jobs I had in the past were dead end. During my last job as a store assistant I really enjoyed helping customers and doing in-store visual merchandising and promotions coming up with creative ways to attract people to the store. 

At the time I finally had enough savings to go back to school so I figured marketing is something I should persue. I graduated in May of last year in marketing management with a distinction, however during my time in college as I progressed studying it more I realised that marketing is not something I can see myself doing, but I kept denying this feeling thinking it will get better until my final year I was literally just forcing myself to get this degree done with no passion.  

I love doing visual art and creating things that people find appealing to look at. Art has always been a passion of mine, but you know when you listen to your parents or other people they say there's no money in it and you have to do something that's going to financially secure you. I should have not listen to them. 

Ever since graduating I applied everywhere even while I was still studying got a couple of interviews, but still no luck. I figured maybe I suck at interviewing so I took the initiative to work on my interviewing skills.

Went on more interviews which I thought went well, but still receiving the ""Unfortunately"" or ""We regret to inform you"" e-mails. This morning I just received another rejection e-mail. I think they are sensing the lack of passion and disinterest I have for marketing.

After consulting reddit and a family member, I learned that some companies ignore the non-solicitation clause in their mutual service agreement, and ""buy out"" an employee working for the other party when they think it's worth it.

I thought that maybe the company wanted to go that road, but I was prudent. I updated my resume and sent it to the recruiter, asking him to make sure to review their service agreement with my employer -- without telling too much.

2 days later: they want to schedule an interview. All right, got it, they want to go down that road. I chose one of the time slot they proposed.

1 day later: the recruiter sent me a short email apologizing. They won't continue the process with me as I was right, they couldn't solicit me. So yeah, he never checked first.

I felt strangely relieved, as I do love my job
despite not being paid to the level of my expertise. I decided to turn this situation to my advantage. I talked to my boss.

I explained what happened without hiding anything. I even told that I was tempted due to the salary. 

She then told me that higher management was already talking about my position, and how I progressed so much since I started 2 years ago to the point where my title and salary don't match what I do. She asked how much they were offering and took note of it. She was surprised they decided to stop the process and even felt sorry for me, but she thanked me for being transparent.

Long story short: i got a promotion last week, a more relevant title, and 30% bump in salary (higher than what was offered by the other company).

That's o.k., as long as you understand it going in.

What you really need to think about is how long it's going to take you to graduate.  With only 12 credits a semester, you'll most likely not graduate in 4 years.  This means you'll have additional tuition payments to make.    


It sounds like you're a good student.  Are AP classes an option?  Or do you have the option of taking classes at a community college right now to earn HS and college credits simultaneously?  The more you can do to earn some of your college credits now, the better off you are. ",2019-12-27 11:55:57

Since then I had two phone interviews, one with her an one with her agency's rep for the client. Both went really well. During the initial interview, I asked about pay range, and I was basically currently at the top of what they were offering and I let her know this. She said she will submit people expecting our of range as long as it is within reason.

Yesterday afternoon, she sent me a text that after the second interview, they passed my resume on to the client, who was interested in bringing me in for a face to face interview.

The problem is the job was a much longer commute time for me. While the commute wasn't an issue and I told them that, gas and tolls were, and the difference would have effectively wiped out any raise I would have gotten, basically netting me the same amount for an additional hour and a half of commute every day.

I laid out the math to her in an e-mail, and said that I did not want to waste anyone's time if her client was unwilling to go as high as I would need to leave my current position (basically 15% over the top of range she gave me).

I have not gotten any response back since then. Just wondering if I burned a bridge there, or if this is normal. Should I have handled it a different way?

I'm in a bit of a tricky situation. I am deciding whether to use a recruiter (that I have been working fairly closely with and I know does a good job) for a job posting or whether to wait and apply directly.

This is a company that I have been referred to by someone who used to work there and I was able to get in contact with the head of the department through LinkedIn and then email. The head was very responsive and mentioned that they would have some roles opening up soon. This makes me think that I have at least a bit of a good shot of getting an interview myself soon.

Today, my recruiter emails me letting me know that this company is about to open up some roles and is asking whether she can submit me. These roles are about to be posted so there's no way I can say I've already applied to them.

Should I use the recruiter or just wait it out and try to do it directly. If I get hired directly, the company would not have to pay a recruiting fee which makes me think I could negotiate a higher salary. I don't want to piss of this recruiter though as she has been doing a good job and has gotten me some phone interviews so far.

Here is the thing from what I gathered from this. The recruiter who contacted me didnt want to do the phone screening so the recruiter assigned someone else to do it which is why the recruiter avoided the day I stated to do it which was yesterday. I wondering if there is a conflict with this recruiter and the other person lol. Who does that?? So i guess the person who was assigned is  like f this im not doing it. I guess they are just losing a great candidate because i recently got an offer that was 10k higher than theirs lmfao

I read multiple places online that hiring managers are really impressed when you put together a plan powerpoint or information on what you would do/ideas to improve.

1904,ddt4fp,False,Recruiters,4,Should I ask to be reconsidered for a position I declined a few months ago?,jobs,"I am in a troubled situation...... and kinda want to beat myself for it.  I received two job offers in June and long story short, now I want the one I declined.  One job was a contract position with a non-profit and the other was with a large finance company as a full time employee.  I had been in the corporate world for such a long time that I wanted to try working at a non-profit and had been looking for that type of opportunity.  At the same time I started interviewing for that, I was put in contact with a friend of a friend at the finance company and we ended up meeting for lunch and then I was asked to interview in person with multiple people and after a background check I was made an offer.  Within hours I was also offered the nonprofit contract to hire job.

I thought about it over a weekend and felt that I should try the non-profit because I believed in the mission, etc. and at the end of the day I had the flexibility to move on fairly easily if I found I hated it immediately because it was contract to hire.  Fast forward 3 months and I was told they were immediately ending my contract due to finances and I left that morning.  Needless to say, I am now without a job with no warning after I was just getting back on my feet.  When I declined the other job I sent the hiring manager a nice email and explained that I really appreciated her time and I just wanted to try something different and it had absolutely nothing to do with the offer or the company.  Had the timing been different, even by a few days, I would have accepted that position.

I don't know if her specific position is still open but they do have the role open on their website.  I really made a mistake.  I guess if I want to look at the silver lining it would be that I at least tried something and learned it was not for me, but now I have no job.  The contract company will look for something too but they weren't expecting it either so there isn't anything lined up.

I want to reach back out to the finance company and ask to be reconsidered.  I just have no idea how to approach it.  I didn't decline on bad terms and did explain that it was an apples to oranges situation so I do think that is positive.  How do I approach this situation?  Should I reach back out to the recruiter or directly to the hiring manager?  Is it a bad idea in general?  I thought calling would be the most professional thing to do but I feel weird doing that knowing that everyone uses their cell phone and it is a bit of an awkward potential conversation.  I want to be able to explain myself which I know would come through much clearer in writing.  How do you even title an email like that?  What would I put in the subject line?  I am inclined to go back through the recruiter given I would still have to go through official channels regardless.  And I know there are similar roles open even if it isn't hers that maybe I could still be considered for which a recruiter would know more about.  I also know how busy email gets and if I reach directly out to her I feel like there is a chance she would miss it or not have time to respond immediately and I don't want to put her in that position given she is a friend of a friend.  I feel like if she is going to say no or that the position has been filled it would be much easier for her to not have to do it directly to me.  

But I could be overthinking it.  Does anyone have advice?  I am a bit panicked right now which doesn't help with the thinking clearly.

Basically about 1-2 days ago I put my resume on a different job board hoping to find different jobs than the ones I was seeing on the one I was using. Then earlier today I got a call from a recruiter asking if I was interested in a job, the first job he offered had too much of a commute so I turned that one down but then the second job was like a great match for me. It's close by, the pay was a bit less than the 1st job but still decent and the work itself didn't seem to demanding. 

The recruiter didn't really ask about my skills or anything and just said he'd get back to me. Shortly after he calls me back saying that the company would want me and that I'd be starting Wednesday (2 days). It just seems so odd that I didn't even get an interview. The recruiter then asked if I could come into his office to fill out paperwork and forms tomorrow. He gave me a bit of info of the job and also asked if I'd want to set up direct deposit. I at first said yes and he said I would need to get a direct deposit form from my bank.

So after the call I calmed down from my excitement of finally get a chance at a job again, and felt like the whole situation felt really off. The recruiter emailed me and mentioned that I was going to need to bring my drivers licence, social security card and a direct deposit form from my bank with all my banking info on it. And ""  It all needs to be printed, it can’t be hand written or our corporate office won’t accept it.  "". I didn't think recruiters were the ones that are suppose to handle the HR related stuff of the company i'm being hired at so why does he need all that info. He later sent me another email asking for my Date of birth, Full name and SSN so he could "" get your background check running"". Again why is the recruiter the one handling that. 

I looked him up and his company (Synerfec \[Didn't get any results here\]) and while that info all seems legit and the business itself seems right, the whole situation feels off. I called the company he said he got me the job for and they confirmed that they got a call for me and wanted to hire me. So I'm going over tomorrow before meeting with the recruiter to just check out the business myself to make sure the job offer itself is real. 

So my main question is, is this how job recruiter handle things now a days? It just feels so off that they would ask for the information and do the stuff a company itself would be doing.

He even said he loved my personality and thought I'd fit right into the company. 

Friday comes along and I hadn't heard anything from him so I sent an email to follow up.

So today I called to follow up and got the recruiting agency's front desk and asked to speak to the recruiter. He seemed pretty annoyed that I had called, confirmed that he didn't get my email, said that he had already submitted my resume and application and was still waiting to hear back, but kept acting annoyed as if I had broken some kind of protocol by calling him.

 What are your thoughts on reaching out to tech recruiters on LinkedIn and asking them out for coffee as a way to learn more about their problems, what they look for in potential hires, and also as a way to network?

Because the position was a contract to hire, he said he would email me the full job description as well as the benefits that his company would offer while I was under the contract period prior to moving to be a full time employee as soon as we hung up. He also explicitly stated to text or call him once I reviewed the information if I wanted to move forward as this was his personal number.

""Hello,
This is [me], I am so sorry to bother you, I just haven't received any information via e-mail yet and wanted to check in with you. Thank you!""

About 30 minutes later he says:
""Sorry, I'll send that information over right now. My apologies!""

This is my first job out of college so I’d appreciate some insight on this weird situation. I work on a team of 5 research coordinators as the only research assistant, and yesterday 2 of our team members received emails that they will have individual meetings with our supervisor, boss, and the department’s HR guy on Friday 5/15. 

Their meetings are scheduled at 9:00am and 9:30am. The remaining 3 of us have been sent a meeting for the same day at 10:00am, where all 3 of us will be in the meeting together. We’re apparently expected to give an overview of what we do each day and are responsible for, even though we all check in daily through email (because we’re teleworking).

I’ve already heard that studies have been taken from the 2 research coordinators who received emails and given to the others. Which makes me think they’ll be laid off at their meetings tomorrow. Does anyone know if that’s what this sounds like? And why the 3 of us will have to explain what we do on a regular basis, minutes after the other meetings end?

They can’t let us all go because our multiple studies would completely fall apart, so I imagine they’ll at least keep 2 coordinators. I’m only the assistant so I’m genuinely shocked I’m not currently set to have a mandatory individual meeting with the HR guy...

It’s felt like we’ve had to “sell” ourselves multiple times over the past few weeks and basically provide an argument on why we’re a necessary part of the team.

I work in billing and collections for a regional healthcare system in the Northeast. As a result of COVID19, we’ve been told by management that revenue is projected to drop by millions of dollars. 

My supervisor told the team yesterday that productivity is going to be tracked closely and now is the time to crank it up to avoid “outsourcing and layoffs.” Healthcare has been hit super hard in terms of layoffs across the country. 

Now with that being said, I like the organization because they like internal promoting. I’d like to get a position in HR as that is my career goal and am using my current position as a stepping stone.  However, they are not posted any vacancies in the organization’s HR department. 

However, I received an offer for the contact tracer job for the state of New York which pays $20,000 more than my current job. I don’t know what the benefits look like yet and may have that position until May 2021 or less, it depends on the spread of the virus.

1940,hb3v2k,False,Layoffs,5,I’m pretty sure a new employee at my company got me fired. I have no idea how or what he said.,jobs,"Hi, all. I’m in a tough spot that I’m having a hard time moving on from. 

For a year I have been the marketing director of a medical manufacturing company. I had a killer year with lots of little victories. I felt, for the first time, that I was really part of a team at work. I never received negative feedback, even when explicitly asking for it. I was well-liked around the office and people respected my work. I put in long hours and dedicated a lot to my job. Things were going great. 

COVID came around and I was temporarily furloughed, along with most of the company. No problem. I spoke with my boss (VP) over the phone during this period and she ensured me I’d be back soon. Then communication stopped, abruptly. 

A week later, an HR person who I did not know called to tell me my position was being eliminated. I was gutted. Still no word from either of my bosses, which seemed bizarre to me. Others in the company had no idea I was being terminated and the ones who did were just as confused as me. I asked the HR director repeatedly why I was being laid off, as it simply didn’t sit right with me. He insisted every time that it was COVID related and not due to performance whatsoever. 

Now, weeks later, my position is being posted again. Same responsibilities. Same pay. It is clear that I was lied to about why I was let go. 

I have a gut feeling that a new employee who was taking over the PR department has something to do with it. He was compulsively obsessed with the President of our company and would do literally anything to please him. He was constantly listening in on everyone’s conversations and reporting it back to people. He would talk to me all the time and even called me while I was on furlough to catch-up. I honestly believe he told the President things I said in private, or lied about things I said. 

I know I should let it go, but I am torn up and want closure.

I’ve filed for unemployment, but with COVID-19 I really just don’t think I’ll find a job for months. At least. Unemployment is half of what I have been making and living okay with. Not spending a ton, but spending 3/4 of my income each month on living. I’m scared that I won’t be able to cover my cost of living if I don’t get a job in the next month or so. 

I’m trying to look at this as a sign to make a move like I have been wanting to do and trying to rationalize doing; but will unemployment transfer states? It doesn’t feel financially smart to move states when I don’t have a job and the world is sick. But if I don’t move now, I’ll start a new job and then really not be able to move for years.

Any advise? What are you all doing to stay sane, or positive. I just want to wallow. I’m a pessimist and this is not going to go well from what I can see. What are y’all doing to stay busy?

I was furloughed for 3 months. Before the furlough, I worked on a project and was successful in getting the approval needed from the vendor (bring new clients/works/businesses). I even designed internal workflows for the company. The project was originally assigned to someone else but because I had background in this specific project from my previous jobs, I took it over. I was told I'd come back but alas they laid me off.

Now, my boss offered me time to talk to him when he delivered the news (lay off) to me. He's also willing to write me a recommendation and he said that I'm on the top of his list for a call back should things get back to normal.

I know I'm not getting my job back but at the very least I'd like to be recognized for my work esp since that project was outside of my daily duties.

My company works in chicken meat business. I was hired as a delivery guy for grocery stores. The company is trying to expand the business by delivering the meat to a famous fast food restaurant. Since, I have backgrounds doing this in my previous job. I'm familiar with this specific chain's standards, meat requirements and procedure. I was able to get my company approved in delivering their meat to this fastfood chain.

In the email he said the company was going through a little reorg and he wanted to figure out workloads. He wanted to see granularity in what I was doing. The email was only sent to me and not the rest of my department. 

Does this sound like the beginning of a layoff? Considering he said company reorg and the fact he asked me for a list of what I was working on really sounds suspicious. I've only been with the company since October 2019 and so I'm the most junior in the department and youngest. 

Obviously I don't want to lose my job because of financial reasons but what I'm also really worried about is my career growth. Before this job I worked for a year in Accounts Payable.

I guess that I was uncomfortable with the different method that is enforced by the company.

So we started talking about lay offs, how they wanted to part from me and recruit someone else.

Then covid happened. We were all working from home and the HR director told me that they decided against laying me off considering the climate (which is incredible). She told me we’d talk about the lay off once everyone was back at the office with the covid under control.

Then last week, Grace, now my manager, told me they had discussions about me with the higher ups and they thought it would be a good move for to change teams and do other tasks. She told me I would remain working with her but I would also work on some other stuff that she thinks I’m good at.

I've been working at home on a W-9 as a contractor for the past month, very limited hours. They decided on Friday to re-structure the corporate office to eliminate three positions to save money, including mine.

They want me to continue working for two more weeks, and have said that I can use office resource to job hunt during that time. At the end, I'll get my accrued vacation time paid out.

What happens if I tell them that I can't work any more? I understand I'd end up forfeiting the vacation pay. Is there legal recourse they could take against me?

When you have spare time over the next two weeks, beef up your resume, gather information on your current role and accomplishments, touch base with coworkers and ask for help with your job search. Some employers will offer outplacement services through an employee assistance program - ask HR for any help.

When the two weeks is up don’t be hard on yourself, treat the job search like it’s your new job until you find something you want to do and take advantage of unemployment and any other services you can find - never be afraid to ask for help.

1961,frxdkh,False,Layoffs,14,Teammate was fired without cause. Should we all be jumping ship?,jobs,"Hi Reddit. For reference, I'm in California.

I work on a small team within a larger international organization of about 200 employees. We've been fully remote since the state's shelter-in-place order was announced. Today a member of my team, who I often work closely with, was fired without known cause. Our manager asked to meet with him in person at the office this morning, and he was instructed to bring his computer.

He had been there for about two years and never received any kind of disciplinary action or even casual talk about his performance. Arguably, he is the most talented member of our team. He was enjoyable to work with and conducted himself professionally.

He called me after the termination to tell me he wasn't given a reason by either our manager or the HR director, both of whom were in the meeting. He explicitly asked why and they refused to answer him. I am stumped and also very freaked out.

Our company has been in the middle of negotiations with a venture capitalist firm, although as far as I know nothing has been signed or made official. However, my coworker told me this was not framed to him as a layoff--it was unambiguously a termination.

I guess I have two questions. How freaked out should I be? My manager called me later in the morning to notify me and tell me my job is safe, but that doesn't feel very comforting right now. Given the state of the world, looking for another job isn't likely to be very fruitful for at least the foreseeable future.

When I was hired (less than a year ago), I requested an employee handbook but was told that none exists. On the phone with my manager today, I asked if we have any kind of formal disciplinary system (to address performance issues before termination) and she said no. Both of these factors seem to open the company up to a lot of liability. Is it worth reaching out to an employment lawyer just to understand my rights?

I assume that is coming, but I think my employer is hoping I'll find a job of my own accord without them having to dedicate any resources to me, either in the form of an assisted job search or severance. This last point is my biggest question mark:

* I've been with this company (which is large and worldwide) for 9 years and technically hold a manager title. I believe I am due some severance, should that be the result, but I don't know what to expect. Can anyone fill me in?
* Specific questions include:
   * What kind of compensation should I expect to be included?
   * Insurance?
   * What recompense is there for unused vacation days?
      * If there is none, should I begin burning through my days now? Is that most certainly to anger the powers that be?
   * I know there is supposedly an option to negotiate your severance package. Can anyone divulge to what extent?

\*I've basically been told that if I can find a job internally, take it, and if not, wait until I'm officially laid off before accepting something outside of the company, lest I voluntarily forego my potential for severance. That makes sense, but in the meanwhile, it's kept my external job search on a bit of a backburner (plus still performing my current job duties and OH YEAH WORLD FALLING APART, KIDS HOME, NO DAYCARE, etc.

I've loved my job and the company. It's only now, a week and a half after being told, that I'm starting to consider some of these harder questions.

It's a bit of a bummer because I loved everything about this work and the people around me. I told everyone how much I loved everything about the company.

After being told this news, I went home and felt sorry for myself (only a few tears were shed!) and had dinner with my family as a consolation. But today I've filed for unemployment, made an outline of things to do while I have so much time on my hands (which includes a lot of time for applying for jobs) because I can't stand not having structure, and will be working on updating my resume.

Since I haven't been unemployed for the past 7 years, I'm almost at a loss of what to do. I'm a bit discouraged because I graduated from college 2 years ago with a BA in Social Science and stayed working at the daycare program while I've been searching for work up until September 2019. Before the daycare, I worked in retail for 4 years, the last year being a supervisor. Now I have a 2-month position for my only office job in marketing, a career that I want to pursue after having no direction to work towards. Just a few questions:

&#x200B;

1. How do I list the 2-month job on my resume? Should I even list it because it was such a short term position? If I do list it, how can I talk about it when it was a short amount of time?
2. Is there anything I should know about being unemployed? I know I need to keep busy, so I'm making sure that I'm continuing to take the online courses for marketing as I have been for the past several months so I can show that I serious about this, and the fact that I didn't go to school for this industry. And exercise for stress relief.
3. Should I just get another job as soon as I can, no matter what it is? I'm not talking about going back to part-time work, but another entry-level office job? I'm aware that I have bills/loans to pay, so that does add weight. I live at home now though.
4. I will also have no health insurance. I turn 26 next week. Happy birthday to me? What do I do about that?
5. If you don't have any answers to those questions, I'd still love to hear about anyone's past/current experience in any similar position!

I would explain what I did and how I did and I would explain to any prospective recruiters/employers that you were happy there and they were happy with you, however as it was a start-up they had to make some budget-cuts/layoffs. Be honest about it. Be enthusiastic about working in the field and if you are then you will definitely be hired. 

I wouldn't worry too much about courses, any popular high-demand ones I would take if I could but the normal online ones are normally no value. 

I wouldn't hurry. Think about your direction in life and what you want to accomplish for the next 10 years. Do you see yourself in retail or marketing? Do you see yourself in a different field. It is always easy to change a job, however building up is hard. You normally need years of experience for high-level positions so if you liked marketing and you want to do marketing in the future then you should try and get into marketing or a similar sounding role - PR for example. I know it will be though for a few weeks/months but stick it out and apply for any marketing jobs. It might be even worth getting a below market value with 1-2k per year but staying there for 1-2 years so you can build experience.

About the health insurance - are you in the US? If so then I can't help as I'm UK based. Ask maybe a friend or a relative that has experienced unemployment at some point. Surely you're not the only one ever to be layed off.

1999,de8qao,False,Layoffs,16,"Should I tell people I was ""laid off"" or that I ""transitioned out?""",jobs,"Based in the US.

Question (background to follow):

Should I talk openly with people about being laid off, or should I use the phrase ""transitioned out?""

I want to protect myself from being seen as either incompetent or bitter.  I wasn't fired, but I understand that some people hear ""laid off"" as ""fired.""  I want people to know that I am good at my job but didn't leave on my own accord (I'm still working through my emotions concerning the lay off).  I also don't want to come off as petty by wanting people to know that it wasn't my decision to be ""transitioned out.""  

I'm thinking of using the phrase ""transitioned out"" with everyone, and when asked 'why' responding with ""I was laid off because the company didn't have the capacity to keep me on staff. However, I continued to work with them as an independent contractor for a few months during the transition.""  I feel like that paints me in a good light while being honest, but would love to hear people's thoughts.

&#x200B;

Background:

At the end of 2018, I was given a different position, had my hours cut by about 85%, and moved from W2 to 1099.  None of this was a surprise as I knew there was a transition coming months previous.

Early this year I told my boss that I wasn't interested in the current position and would like to stay on with the company (we'll call them Company 1) if I could be doing something similar to the position I had previously.  I was told they ""didn't have the capacity to keep me on"" in that role and that they had given it to someone else (fresh out of college; I'm middle age). I told them I'd give them a month to find someone to replace my current role because it wasn't what I was hired for, didn't feel particularly good at it, and didn't enjoy it.  Boss told me he was sorry to see me go. I've since done some work with them as an independent contractor, as well as donated my time answering a couple of questions concerning my past role via phone calls and emails from people both in and out of Company 1.

My old employer used the term ""transitioned out"" in company emails to describe my leaving and wrote it in a way that made it sound like I had left for a position in another company (we'll call them Company B).  This bothered me as I had been working part-time for both companies for a few years and my work load at Company B didn't change at all after being laid off from Company 1.  Completely independent part-time jobs.

I went to Unemployment to see if I would qualify for anything.  I told them what happened and they said, ""OK, so you were laid off from Company 1."" Honestly, that's the first time I had thought of it that way.  I thought I had simply left, but I realized that I would still be working for Company 1 if it had been my choice. My old boss hadn't thought of it that way either, but did confirm with Unemployment that I had been laid off (which qualified me for a year of unemployment that I haven't had to use because I've been busy independently). I've since been telling myself and close friends that I was laid off from Company 1, but I don't know how to talk about it informally to other people, or professionally to others in the industry.

2000,dv3nzb,False,Layoffs,10,Terminated from job after 4 weeks because of “lack of fit”,jobs,"Hi guys, I was working at a new social work job in NYC starting from sept to end of oct. I haven’t posted about the termination too much because, out of coincidence, I ended up in the hospital the day after (unrelated) and had a fairly invasive surgery.

Anyways, the job, without providing much detail, as in a jail setting with male inmates. I am a early/mid 20s female. The day prior to my termination, I received an email from my supervisor to report to HR day after. No explanation. I get there and they hand me the paper stating I was terminated. I was told to return my ID then and that was my last day.

I asked them for a reason and they said “lack of it,” and they refused to provide further details, stating that they were “unaware” of the specific issues since HR is a “different department.” The paperwork says I was supposed to receive an “exit package,” but I have only received my paycheck, to which the pay ends the day i was terminated. My health insurance was cut off the day after (fair), but they took out money for the pretax subway card which I did not receive.

I have had friends who believe that there were discriminatory concerns, as I am the youngest female in that particular department, and had staff comment on my appearance, moreso than other staff members when wearing the same attire. I personally believe that there is no discrimination, and perhaps they didn’t feel I was mature enough for the job. However, I didn’t get any warnings of my performance with my supervisor, so I did feel a bit blindsided. 

I just want a neutral POV of what might have been the concerns they saw, and how can I avoid them in the future. But also to know if this is a fairly standard type of termination when fit is the issue. Looking back, I’m not too upset about the job loss, as the commute was 3+ hours and extremely unreliable. Thank you!

I’m a data entry specialist/on air personality/office specialist, basically a jack of all trades in the station. Typically work overnights but work early mornings quite often to help out. 

My boss has it in his head that the national wage is going up to $15/hour and so it has caused him to make snap decisions. He fired two of the girls in the office (who are single moms), a lot of people quit, and he eliminated my position to where I’m only working on weekends now starting January 9th according to the schedule.

He’s anti confrontational and never told me of any of these changes. We’ve heard rumors, but nothing set in stone. I only just found out because a coworker of mine was accidentally looped in with the manager’s email chain talking about the changes. 

Imo, I think the business is going under. He made a very idiotic decision for our sales team to offer 1 ad for 50% off and get another one free, essentially losing ad revenue with doing this deal.

There's no real reason to quit if you're only working weekends.  Being free on weekdays leaves you plenty of time to apply and interview other places. Personally I'd stay, just to keep some income, until you find a better position. ",2019-12-30 22:22:31
2005,esjiz8,False,Layoffs,1,"Moved across the country for dream job, 30 days in and there are layoffs.",jobs,"So let me start by apologizing, but I am typing this on mobile and there may be grammatical errors.

I really need some outside perspective on this, because I am currently in a situation that I can safely say I’ve never been in before.

Little background: I’m a college graduate with about 9 years of work experience under my belt; including publications with the government. But the field I’ve found myself in for my “career for life” is one in which I specialize in a very niche production/manufacturing method and oversee the regulations surrounding this particular process. 

Niche as in there’s right around 11 facilities in the US that even do this process, whereas it’s super popular in Europe. 

I spent a little over 4 years at one of these facilities (smallest one in the US and a startup), expanding my knowledge, learning everything I could, getting certified in all the right things, etc. Eventually I maxed out my potential (and hit a salary ceiling) with this company and felt it was the right time to spread my wings and get my foot in the door with a more established facility.

Enter my current place of business. 

Thankfully I am single and have no kids, so after I landed a job at the new company I simply packed up my car and moved. I love the state and I really enjoy the company.

The upper management was very black and white about the reason they were hiring new blood in this department: the company had been purchased by a huge multinational organization who was revamping what was and is currently a dysfunctional facility. They needed “fixers”, people knowledgable in this field who weren’t afraid to come in and wrestle my particular department (among others) back under control.

I can say after a month that I wasn’t far off in my expectations when I accepted the job. 

Here’s the issue: 

The company is now running more efficiently and corporate has determined they have more staff than necessary to run at the forecasted capacity for this year. Obviously marketing is busting their balls to bring in bigger contracts but it hasn’t happened yet. So management has decided layoffs will be necessary and has announced this to the staff. 

I’ve been told privately by my boss (manager over my department) that my position is protected but my coworker (we are both supervisors in the same department), who was hired 3 months before me, is constantly whispering and fear mongering to me about his concerns that regardless of what management says - we are on the block and the company is failing. He says he knows this cause he has seen it happen with other facilities he has worked at before.

The rational side of me says there is no way a plant that has been purchased by this massive company and just finished a million dollar investment project/remodel is going under and that my experience is valuable enough to spare me from the layoffs. Plus they would lose their 10k sign on bonus they just paid me. 

The paranoid side of me is of course convinced that I’m about to be jobless in a new city miles away from “home”. 

Extra random info: 

-I do have a bit of a cushion fund that would help me get home, my house is being rented back in my home state but I could crash with family for free while looking for work.

-My boss gave me a very positive 30 day review, and has made a point to have me sit down with his boss (director from corporate) and show him my current projects (he was happy with my progress) and my boss even introduced me to his boss’ boss, who was excited to have someone on board with my experience since it is so niche.

TLDR: relocated 12 hours away to a new city to work at a cool company with the explicit intent to help them overhaul a struggling department. 30 days in layoffs have been announced and now my coworker is convinced he and I are going to be caught up in the layoffs and/or the whole company is about to close down. I’ve never been fired or laid off before and am mildly paranoid about this possibility.

My manager was absolutely nice and started to show me my jobs, tasks etc. I never lied to them about my abilities or knowledge and I told them that I am a very quite person, but if I do not understand I ask for help/info. Few days later, the main manager goes to holiday. He booked a long time ago and left me with a lot of tasks to complete and a schedule to follow every day. As soon as I got there:

\-My desk was empty. Main pc was taken by someone else, I asked for clarification, still waiting an answer. Other manager ask me to get my personal laptop next day.

\-All my schedule is being changed by the other managers as they like and I am being tucked away to a department to help them due to absences and holidays booked by people. I do understand that I am the new person, so I just joined this department and helped them as the other managers kept asking me.

\-This department is a mess, people rely to their impression, they do not have any spreadsheets/formula/process. So, I was constantly confused by their own confusion. I started to take care of the most important things, get the warehouse to pack the orders in time. 

\-That led to the warehouse team deciding that I am their direct manager and complaining about everything, from the roof leaking and to the HR issues as holidays.

Finally, after 7 days, my direct manager come back and it's announcing that he is leaving soon. That leads to the HR people telling me that I am not good enough for them, I can't do his job (which is obviously , I did not apply for the managing position, but the assistant one!) so they need some person with a lot of experience behind and my role is going to be cut. When I asked if I did something so wrong to let me down that quickly, they replied that I am slow and I should known everybody jobs and process by now. I replied that I did not have any real guidance expect for the first few days, and I did repeatedly ask for more training from seniors and I did asked them that in this way I would do more harm than good. Well, HR started to say that I was not polite, that I did ask too many questions and to get the checks for the 2 weeks and leave.

I tried to not be upset, because I had a feeling last weekend that some sh\*tshow was going to hit me, but I tried to talk with the nice manager and he apologize for leaving me to the wolf and that he did not care about my situation because he is leaving. Which made him not that nice in the end.

So, Do I have to take this as sign that maybe I should not aspire to have technical job and settle for the normal admin stuff that I did for the last 4 years.

Now comes the fun part. If you do your job correctly, then she has nothing to say about you unless it directly involves her. And you as a person are going to, maturely, make this big:

\- Trust: You as a person have been insulted and won't undergo this. You are going to exploit this as hard as possible, let the company know that trust for you is a serious requisite and this damages any future involvement with the colleague.

I graduated last summer and worked for my mom while applying to full-time jobs. I wasn’t having any luck until “Company X” hired me on the spot three weeks ago. I was so excited to finally be able to work a real job in my field of study. I interviewed with the President of the company and they made the job seem too good to be true (because it was) but I was sold, as I was desperate to start working. I quickly learned that the position was NOTHING like what I was told it would be. I was pretty much doing customer service for up to 10 hours a day. My coworkers barely spoke to me unless I made a mistake or they needed me to run errands for them outside the office like grab coffees. No matter how nice or accommodating I tried to be, all the managers treated and spoke to me like an outcast. No one even bothered to introduce themselves or ask who I was upon meeting. I was expected to know how to do everything right off the bat without any formal training and was practically scolded by my managers on a daily basis for making honest mistakes. Going to work everyday made me physically uncomfortable but I didn’t want to quit without having anything lined up and I also thought that maybe if i stuck it out a little longer, I could establish myself as a valuable member in the company. Wrong. One of the managers (not even my boss) called me this morning to inform me that “the team had a discussion and felt that  I was not a right fit.” Part of me is relieved that I don’t have to go back to such a toxic work environment but the other part of me feels completely helpless. It took me so long to find this position and now I wonder how long it will take to find the next. My goal was to be employed by the summertime and we’re approaching the end of April.

I got hired to work in an office as the two owners really needed help because they were understaffed. I told them that I would be willing to work until mid-August since I would be leaving to go to school, this was back in April. I made sure to mention early on that I wanted to take a two-week vacation in July, which was approved and worked up until the start of my vacation everything was fine.

Fast-forward to the end of my two-week vacation, I text my boss, owner 1, and say that I made it back okay and that I’m ready to continue working. 

He responds to me a day later stating,
”Hey man, hope your vacation went well. So here's an update on things we have hired two more employees, so we are covered with regular staff. Your last check is here which you can pick up during normal office hours. Also, we may need help here in the office on the weekends (busiest time of the week) and if that is the case we will reach out to you and check your availability.”

The thing about maybe needing extra help was basically fluff to make them seem like they weren’t putting me in rough spot by letting me go a month earlier than we had agreed on, but such is life, right?

I didn’t respond to this text because I was equal parts embarrassed and upset at the reality of my being let go. I was never given any indication that they didn't want me or that I was messing something up for them and the office. Also something about getting let go through text made me really upset and I find it somewhat demeaning. 

As well as not responding, I never went to pick up my check until yesterday. When I got there, the only person in the office was one of the new employees and despite his best efforts, had no luck finding my check. He texted the owner 2 and he told the new employee to tell me to come back tomorrow in the afternoon to pick up my check.

Which bring me to today. As I was about to leave my house to go to the office again I got a text from the owner 2 saying,
”I looked for your check in the office but owner 1 placed it somewhere and I couldn't find it. He's on vacation until next week but I'll try to get ahold of him again to double-check on where it is. Thanks and sorry about that.”

Honestly, along with being taken aback by the what happened with my previous employer, I'm left not knowing how to respond to any of this as it's the first time I have been fired/let go/laid off (whichever is most appropriate) and I have has other jobs before this one.

It wasn’t the right fit so I was somewhat relieved. I’m feeling self-conscious about potentially having to explain that I was the only one that was laid off in a small team. We didn’t part on bad terms but I’m not 100% my direct manager will sing me praises either. 

I had sent out some resumes prior to being laid off and now just starting to get callbacks for interviews. 

Wanted to ask what I should disclose? I’m sure I will get asked “why are you looking for a job?” Should I disclose that I was laid off (technically was still employed when I sent out the resume) or spin it so that it focuses on why the potential new job is the better fit? Technically they are not asking if I’m still employed. I don’t want to lie but I also want to be mindful about what I am obligated to disclose at this stage of the recruiting process. 

I asked my previous employer (a big corporation) about what they will disclose to my future employer in terms of reason for me no longer employed, they said they can only confirm employment dates and salary. Actually there is a toll free number that they provide to do that.

I was one of the people that was going to be in the first phase of layoffs, others were told they would be after my group, etc. I was given a paper that day that said in August my employment would be terminated, and details about severance would be given at that time.

Over the following months many in my department decided not to wait to be terminated and found jobs either inside or out of the company. (I tried too, but to no avail as of yet). Also, to nobody’s surprise, the overseas team that is supposed to be taking over isn’t able to perform at the level they need to. 

Last week I get pulled into a meeting with some others that were slated to be let go in August where they tell us they would like to have a few of us fill some positions they need filled over the busy season, effectively making it an extension until February. This was presented as an *option* to extend, not mandatory. 

On Monday I email my manager and my director my decision to not extend. I don’t feel like it’s my responsibility to cover their poor decision, and I also have another job that is offering to give me more hours. I get a response back saying that I we should have a call, and on the call my director says that he already told HR that we all wanted to extend. I told him that I didn’t want to and that he should retract that.

Later that day we speak again and he tells me that last week they presented the extension incorrectly, and that we were being extended regardless. The option to leave with severance is no longer an option according to him. I voiced my displeasure, asked if I do find something within the company could I take it, etc, but in no way did I communicate that I was grateful to be extended. 

Here’s my question: this whole this seems a little shady. The extension was presented by two people as being optional, and once I decided to exercise the option to *not* extended, the option to leave gets taken away from me. Can they actually do that? What advice do you have?

My question is if I’m laid off, can I present myself as employed to potential employers?  Obviously, being employed is more attractive to potential employers and gives me more leverage for salary negotiations.

2042,cqdjv4,False,Layoffs,5,can I ask to get laid off? help please!,jobs,"So I recently had a normal weekly meeting with my boss. She was showering me with praise during this meeting, saying they are ""so impressed"" with my work, and how how I've been ""instrumental"" to the changes taken place in the department. Then, at the end of the meeting, my boss told me ""by the way, this isn't because of your performance, but we are cutting your hours down to 10-15 hours per week because since hiring a new person in the department, we don't have the money in the budget for your hours."" I think this is a classic case of choosing to hire a new person for crap pay, and try and phase out the seasoned workers who you have to keep giving raises to. Obviously it pissed me off but I try to understand it's not personal and it happens to people all the time. I'm looking for jobs and furiously applying.

The real problem is that I live over 60 miles from the office, and regularly work from home for part of each week, but now my boss is saying my ""new schedule"" will consist of two 6 hour days in-office. I already told my boss at our meeting look, that doesn't work for me, I cannot afford to spend 1/2 my earnings in gas to get there and back. But they're apparently taking away working from home as a privilege (even though I did nothing wrong.)

I'm going to have a frank discussion with my boss this afternoon and explain my dissatisfaction with this arrangement, and also, I really want to ask to just be laid off. The meager pay I'll be receiving for roughly 12 hours of work per week, barely makes it worth it for me to drive over an hour each way to the office. I think they have decided to drop my hours instead of lay me off, because there's still some projects I'm working on for them and they want to get every last drop of work out of me rather than just let me go now. They have to  know that for any adult human being who owns a home, 12 hours of work per week factoring in the distance I travel, is not a sustainable income. 

I wanted to hopefully get some opinions and find out if ""asking"" to be laid off is even remotely a possible thing to do. I am thinking of putting it to be boss this way, saying: ""look, I know there probably was some discussion behind the scenes about if it would be possible to keep me onboard or if I would have to be let go. I'm guessing the choice to keep me on for 10-15 hours a week is the max that was allowed in the budget. For me personally, as I explained, this is hardly sustainable even during the process of searching for new employment. I want to find out if a lay off was ever in the cards and if that could be a possibility instead of the decrease in hours.""

I'm afraid she's going to take that as me quitting, which is obviously not what I want because it ruins my chances of collecting unemployment.

So I worked as a part-time receptionist for a spa for a few months. During the hiring process, I had told the owner that I had a back surgery approaching and need a month off, therefore to please consider that when choosing to hire me. She did, and right off the bat I could tell that she had little to no experience owning a business (puts her personal stress on workers, hires and fires, unprofessional, goes on constant vacations etc.) however, I had no issues as she was rarely in the building. She wished me good luck before I left for surgery and came back exactly a month later.

I worked all of  June 35hrs/wk and was off in May for surgery. I was off last weekend for a mini vacation that was approved before. During my vacation, I had gotten an email that I was terminated for not making enough sales in May and June. Ruined my weekend to say the least, I loved my job and loved my coworkers. 

I am not quite sure about the reasoning, I was off in May and not a single person made enough sales in June. We hardly have enough clients to make payroll, as many of our massage therapists quit due to owner's unprofessional-ism. She has a bad reputation with our local massage school so can't get any new therapists in.

2071,avj53g,False,Layoffs,8,Used dealership fired me over an accident that they want me to pay for.,jobs,"Okay, I am sorry in advance but this is going to be a long story. I figured if anywhere, this would be the best place to post this story. I have been thinking of posting this story since December but never got around to it. And with this story, I am not even including the following situations:

\-Straight up sexual harassment

\-sexism

\-drugs on premises 

\-finding a LOADED GUN in a car while photographing the inside 

So I took this job at a used car dealership as their photography assistant or “Webmaster” as they called it. At first, it sounded like an easy gig, having cars pulled into the booth for me and take some shots and on to the next one right? Wrong. So once I got hired, my boss has informed me that I needed to find, drive and park each of the cars into the booth myself and the only job the main photographer had was to find the cars for me and park them in front of my booth. Which this guy never did. He just goofed off while I did all the work and he got praised for it instead of me. They had never mentioned in the interview or anywhere that they needed me to know how to drive manual/stick shift cars. So when I told him that I didn't know how to drive stick, he told me not to worry and that he would get my co-worker to teach me. Well, that never happened. He just kept putting it off and telling me “oh, you won't actually have to do that. Just call me and i'll come to park it for you”. This was BS. I had to call this guy at least 10 times a day to ask him to move a car for me. And when I did, he made fun of me and complained that I didn't know how to drive stick. I only ever got trained by our mechanics that I became close friends with. And that was only two times that I ever actually drove a stick car. Very badly might I add. Fast forward to one day when I am photographing a Scion FR-S( a very nice sports car for those who don't know what that is). Once I got into the car to start it so that I could turn the tires for a side angle, this car jumps forward and hits the refrigerator that is directly in front of me. Now I had my foot on the brakes and the emergency brakes were on as well so I don't know why it did that.  Luckily no one was hurt but I was very shaken from it. After all of my co-workers came to see if I was okay, they checked it out and moved it to behind the building. The front left bumper was messed up and needed to be replaced, so when I was sat down by my co-worker, not even my boss about the details. I was confused when he said that they would make a contract and have my sign it and have 100-200 dollars deducted from my check each week and all bonuses we got each month as well once the car was fixed and they got the price for all of the damage. I was still shaken up so I just nodded along. After I got home and told my mom of the whole thing, she looked at me furiously and told me that they can't charge me for an accident that happened on the site because that's what insurance is for. I was unaware of this and looked it up and she was right. It is illegal for them to charge their employees for any damage done from an accident on the site. I even went so far as to call a lawyer to make sure this was true. Now, this ends up going quiet for about a month, until one meeting we had. There are meetings every Monday and Friday mornings before we start work, and the owner of the company asks me and my co-worker how many cars I am photographing a day and such. Then he proceeds to say jokingly “ well, maybe you can attend the driving school we have so that you don't crash any more cars.” or something like that. My mind’s a bit fuzzy on what he said so I am sorry for that. I was furious and just gave a fake smile as maybe 2 or 3 people faked laughed at it. I felt so embarrassed about it. Now I make fun of myself a lot and joke with people all the time. But when my boss just says something like that to me, that is not cool. So skipping to the next week. The car finally comes back from the shop and is put in the front lot to be sold already. Now here's the kicker... they never submitted the claims to Carfax so that they can update it and let the customer know that there was damage done to the car at one point. I know that for some cases, they don't have to (correct me if I'm wrong) but I knew that they should have for this case. So that day, my boss wanted to talk to me about how we were moving buildings and stuff like that. Then when he was done, i brought up the accident I told him that I do not believe that I had to pay damage on the car because it was not my fault and that there was no reason why insurance couldn't just pay for it. He then looks at me and proceeds to turn the blame on me that I got into the car and starting it, therefore it's my fault and that said “ wouldn't you feel guilty leaving a place knowing you did damage and didn't pay for it” Wtf?? I said no because it wasn't my fault and that I was never properly trained. He then says he will make up the contract and sent me away to continue working. I just left the room to stop myself from having a panic attack. He then called me back an hour later showing me the paper and demanding I sign it. Now I have the full recording of this conversation because I was on the phone with my mom who recorded the conversation. He then told my mom not to worry about it and that we had everything figured out. And then he again sends me away to go work and “not to worry about it” and so I did. 4 HOURS LATER, he calls me into an office and tells me that I am being fired because “it's just not working out”I just say okay and walk out of there and out of the building as fast as I can. I left after saying goodbye to my co-workers that I am friends with.

2074,9eprkv,False,Layoffs,24,Got fired today. It was 100% my fault. What now?,jobs,"I was fired today from my first full-time salaried job. It was an admin job at a big consulting company. I am 24, with little experience. I don't know anyone in my social circles who has been fired yet. After graduating a couple years ago, I struggled to get by, doing internships and contracted gigs. And only a month after I landed my first ""real"" job, I get fired on the spot.

And I completely deserved it. I was terrible at that admin job. I got multiple warnings for my performance and honestly, I saw this coming. I did my best to keep up, but I just did not have the skills for this role.

Prior to this job, I was in roles that involved research, analysis, and translation. I did good work, but it was all through unpaid internships or very lowly-paid contract work. The person I was working for on an informal contractual basis, let's call him Adam, was really happy with my contributions and said that he wished that I could have continued. But I didn't see any path to a full-time, 9-to-5 salaried job, so I left. 

I did have some outstanding research tasks for Adam, however, that I continued to work on over the weekends. So although I formerly left that role a month ago, I was still working on those tasks, and therefore do not technically have a gap in employment. 

&#x200B;

So what now?

Should I leave off this admin job from my resume and note that I continued working for Adam during that month? Would it be dishonest of me to do so? Would it be a red flag for a recruiter if I omitted the admin job? If they found out about it, how would I explain it?

I submitted my last assignment for Adam yesterday. This morning, he asked me how my new job was going. A couple hours later, I got fired. Should I tell him I got fired only after a few weeks of working there, and ask him if he can find a way to get me hired at the organization he works at? 

I made a good impression on him during my time working for him and he made it known multiple times that I did very good work for him. I feel ashamed about all this and I don't want this to affect his perception of me as a professional. Should I lie and say things are going well, and get back to him later telling him that I'm just ""looking to transition into something else""?

I am going as fast as I can and  at what is an uncomfortable pace for me and yet i'm always finishing about half hour behind everyone else at the very least.   


I got totally chewed out yesterday for it (and honestly thought I was going to burst into tears because I am apparently a strong independent adult)  and now I have to outline why I cannot meet my time goals to the boss. But....I have no idea?  I literally cannot go any faster, I spend 2+ hours out of breath and covered in sweat as I am actually going full pelt (with all the water on the floor and my clumsiness that's caused a fair few injuries including one fairly nasty head injury, the speed isn't exactly helping my asthma either)  


The only explanation I can think of is that I am dyspraxic which often makes people slower than their peers at physical tasks but...that feels like a lame excuse? I have disclosed I have dyspraxia to my boss but it felt like I was making excuses there again.   


Maybe i'm just an idiot or being lazy or something? I seriously don't know.

My boss sat me down, and said that our company has been having a rough quarter, and we have had quite a few meetings about reducing overhead. Unfortunately for me, My job is almost all overhead. When I was given the PIP, part of the improvement was bringing my billable hours up, but it's entirely dependent on other people giving me work (Work they themselves probably need right now!).  I have basically been able to maintain a 5% billable ratio, just with small assignments i'm given on top of my regular overhead tasks.  The plan is asking for a 55% billable rate by next month.

I'm not sure if it's an impossible task and they're pushing me out, or if i'm just being short sighted.

My boss is usually extremely fair, and she has gone above and beyond to be a good person in the past.  I just think it's an impossible task, because I have BEEN trying to become more utilized.

I'm not exactly sure where or how to start, but I'm going to do my best to cover as much as I can so it makes sense.

&#x200B;

I work in student housing, and the company I work for has operations in multiple states. Each office varies in size depending on the needs of the property, but almost all work and communication with supervisors is done through emails and phone calls. The property I work at is small compared to the rest of the properties so our office staff has always been 4-7 people. My property is also only 2 years old, and most of the office staff has remained the same since before construction was completed.

&#x200B;

There was recently a change in management, but all of the staff remained so each property basically just reported to a new corporate team.  This new change was difficult for most of the members of my office, and the team that I had worked for 2 years started quitting one by one. When someone would quit, corporate was quick to replace them with someone from their other properties. I'm now the only employee remaining that's been here from the beginning and all of the new employees constantly ask me questions about the operations of the property. I'm not the property manager, but even the property manager that was brought in asks me questions about the property. 

&#x200B;

I also live at the property I work at, and two days ago on my day off my manager caught me while I was outside walking my dog. He approached me and told me that while he was working in the office with a corporate manager, they had received an email about ""dissolving"" my position at the property. That was all of the information that he gave me.  When I asked him if that meant I was fired, he said he didn't know, but that he just wanted to give me the heads up that it was coming. He also told me that they were planning on changing the locks at the end of the business day, so I would no longer have access to the office. After the office closed and everyone went home, I went to the office to see and my keys did not work.

Maximum severance is 20 weeks which he will cap out at so this is significant. OR should he brush off the old resume and start hitting the bricks? I will say that it is my opinion that this fellow is old school experienced. About nothing phases him about his line of work and he is good at it.

It’s a slightly different department than what I used to work in, and the reason why I’m trying to go above and beyond is because my last few months with SpaceX were hell in my personal life, some death and loss of family, so my last few months weren’t the greatest as I just kept to myself and worked quietly so I could go home and work out my personal problems, in which management in my old department said that they wanted me to be in the forefront again and work on all the issues but I couldn’t emotionally or mentally put myself there.

It's been the best job of my life so far, however it was anounced in April this year that the UK side of the business hasn't been profitable in a long time, and the company needed to make 350 redundancies in total this year. and they also had to make 150 redundancies last year.

&#x200B;

I work in the IT department doing 2nd line tech support. We were told by our boss after the original anouncement that these redundancies wouldn't affect us as we were needed so much, so I was pretty relaxed about the whole thing. last week it was anounced that the 1st line team (4 people in total) is being made redundant and their job is being moved to one of our offices in Poland, and now I can't help but feel like the 2nd line team (3 people in total) is next.

&#x200B;

I'm hesitant to just leave. I've had a lot of family issues recently (my dad was diagnosed with Brain cancer last November 2018 and died in February 2019) and my boss as the time was incredible to me. He gave me so much time to take my dad to appointments and sort out what I needed to sort out at home, and also gave me so much time to recover after he passed. He was always calling me outside of work to see if I was okay and if there was anything i needed and just being a generally great guy, so I have a massive amount of respect for him, and I feel like I owe him a huge debt. since then though, he was promoted in January/February 2019 and I've had 2 different managers since then, so everything seems all over the place and I don't know exactly what to do.

My main question though.. should I ride it out for the redundancy pay and get a new job afterwards, or should i start looking now and abandon ship? I've never been in a position where I'll be made redundant before, so I'm not sure what happens in that situation. I believe I get 1 months salary for every year of service, so it wouldn't be a lot in redundancy pay. I've never had issues getting employment though. I was a contractor for a long time, and the longest I've ever been out of work was 4 weeks.

2110,ba5bp3,False,Layoffs,3,"Fired from job within probationary period. Was offered a two-month contract that was supposed to allow me to work from home while seeking new employment. Boss has hit me with two huge, complicated, weird projects. What to do?",jobs,"It's obviously busy work. My new contract is a definite two-month contract, which I have been told will be very difficult for them to terminate. The boss even said the contract could not be terminated, no matter what, bu it's obviously so they can find a replacement. (I'm in the EU.) 

Their reason for my firing was not trusting my skillset in a certain area in which I am inexperienced, and in which they promised to help me learn. They provided no teachable moments.

I don't plan on doing nothing during these two months, but you should see the stuff I was sent. It's as it was written by a madman. It makes no sense, is confusing, unorganized, and obviously just pulled from a back closet to keep me busy.

My question is, how do I handle this? I was fired for very sketchy reasons (I had great relationships with my team, I honestly was doing good work, trying as hard as I could, received nothing but praise from my superiors up until the day I was fired -- my line manager, my colleagues, everyone besides the higher-up is shocked and a bit angry by the decision to let me go).

This two-month contract, the boss said, was out of the ""goodness of his heart."" But there's no way any of this work can be completed within the 7 weeks I have left. Plus I have 6 days holiday, as I will have worked 3 months in total (probation month plus these two). So it's really six weeks.

How do I approach this in a manner that is going to cause the least waves?

I'm more than happy to do work that will help the company/my skillset, but this is ""A Beautiful Mind"" type shit. It's insane. I'm not trying to get out of work, but there's no way focusing my energy on this is going to help anyone. This, on top of several other projects I have going on for the company, which will improve my portfolio and help me in the future. What I have been given by this other boss is honestly a pile or rubble in Word doc form. I'm not meaning to bitch here, but it is indeed the truth.

If it’s “last hired is first fired”, that’s bad for you, but prevented if you prove too valuable to fire.

Same for least valued employee.

To position yourself into being to valueable to fire, you have to up your contribution and value to your group, office, plant, company.

Do this by working your rear end off and being super productive.  If it takes everyone else 4 hours to turn an assignment around, you do it in one.

You might find yourself studying corporate structures late and after hours.  Do so without complaining.  

Also:  look for internal jobs you qualify for and consider applying for them

&#x200B;

The person I first reported to left the division I now work in, and their subordinate, who has been with the company for many, many years, took on my old manager's role. To describe my working relationship with this person would be to describe a relationship that has become emotionally abusive. They do not trust me after making mistakes (6 months on the job, I remind you). They openly criticize me in public, using a demeaning tone. They micromanage me, tell me what to e-mail people, and berate me for small things and scold me for things that should require help and informative training.

Instead of being given constructive criticism on how to improve, I am being told by my manager that unless I go back to my old department (a demotion), they will be put me on a type of ""performance"" program that will track everything I do to make sure I am improving to their standards - the standards which I am not currently meeting and am constantly trying to achieve to little affect. If I do not meet the expectations of this program, I will be let go. The kicker? I am not technically allowed to switch roles until I've been in my current one for at least a year. So I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This has blown me away as it's such a stark contrast to the praise I had previously been given. I am almost certain my manager has some sort of grudge or dislike towards me. Likely because I have been under-trained by my predecessor (who left as a result of getting burnt out) and because my manager expected me to be a prodigy child and learn everything within the first six months.

They want to demote me (and a lot of other people) from a production operator to a packer. That's over a $4/hr reduction in pay.

They overwork their employees. During a slow time like this, they'll want one operator trying to watch 5-6 (or sometimes more) ridiculously complicated machines.

In June I started a new job at a large hospital in a major US city. My job requires me to work closely with four different inpatient units throughout the hospital on various quality and process improvement projects. Everything from reducing infections to increasing patient satisfaction. I've worked in healthcare since graduating undergrad, but am new to this type of work. I have a Master's degree, but am only 28 and haven't had much experience managing teams and leading projects.

I'm working with people who have 5-20+ years of experience on me. During a conversation with my boss in August, we discussed where I think I'm doing well and where I'm struggling. I was told that since I have less experience than my colleagues, they understood mentorship was important. I've been working with two of my colleagues to help me get more comfortable in my role. The mentorship has been going on for a few months, but became more formal in October. I thought I was making progress, but today I had another meeting with my boss; she mentioned they aren't sure if I'm making progress at the expected rate and she wants to meet with me Monday to have a conversation about if I think this is the right position for me and next steps. She wants this to be a comfortable conversation for us both, and doesn't want me to feel intimidated, but I'm freaking out. My company has a six month probationary period for new hires and I'm coming up on six months at the end of this month.

Am I about to get fired? What do you all think will likely happen Monday? From our conversation, I'm not sure if they are planning on firing me or if there are opportunities for me to move into another position at the hospital where I may be better qualified at this stage in my career.

You can google ""fast food restaurant resumes"" to get a good idea of what to put - because your young and probably don't have the experience, focus on the skills section.

This has been an extremely difficult decision to make. If I do join the startup then I feel I would have missed out on the traditional route of graduating and working at a proper firm with a stable salary and a proper learning framework. But I also feel that if I were to join the startup later, I will miss out on the exciting bits of starting something from scratch which carries a lot of learning with it.

Cheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h7rno1/job_at_a_firm_vs_family_startup/,1,"Tough, but personally I would go with the firm. There's two main reasons for this:

1. Working with family blurs lines - I can't speak to what your relationship with your dad is like, but there's a risk that your arguments with your father at home might look similar in the workplace. Some things exchanged between the two of you might not fly if he wasn't your dad. 

2. Possibility of stunted professionalism -  Being able to be sociable with strangers, clients and coworkers, and learning to work in a team with your coworkers (even the ones you don't like) is incredibly valuable. I would worry about not being properly socialized if your only team mate is your dad. 

Is money a big issue for you? If it is, I'd say definitely the firm. 

Would it be possible for you to join in at a later stage of his startup? Or join occasionally as a ""consultant""? Or if you end up hating the firm, could you go back to your dads startup as a fallback? ",2020-06-12 19:44:13

It's not a proper startup because they have an international presence, but the American branch is barely 6 months old. This is the second time they are trying to break into the American market after failing to do so in 2015/2016.

I really like the company and my coworkers, but lately I have become consumed by the idea that our branch is failing. There is absolutely zero leadership, which at first they pitched as a positive, but when they had a CEO candidate leave them at the altar after 3 interviews (including flying the person out to the international HQ), I started to fear that they were just clueless.

Without getting too specific, they recently launched a big new product feature, which isn't optimized for mobile. I was excited for this feature to launch, I was working to help make it happen, and then my jaw hit the floor when I realized that nobody had deisgned this feature with mobile in mind. Can't say how long that feature was in development for but I would guess over 6 months.

Last month (they only pay once a month which sucks), my paycheck was delayed by 9 days. I followed up and apparently my invoice was never submitted to accounting. My boss put me in touch with accounting and it was resolved the next day, but it still made me very nervous to be paid late. I tried writing that off as I'm a contractor and they're disorganized, but in combination with everything else, it feels ominous.

Today, I realized that our new registrations in January were less than half of what they were in September. I honestly don't think anybody else in my branch is even aware of this.

There's other things I could describe and you only have limited info but I am terrified this place is failing. Yet, just last week I was given a permanent ID, and just yesterday the snacks, soda and beer was restocked so what do I know?

All I know is that they are a non profit organization who provide subsidized housing for low to middle income individuals/families. Their base salary is almost 20k more than what I currently make and the benefits are amazing. Due to the COVID19 situation, they will have me working remotely until the threat is gone. I am a recent graduate and I am struggling financially. It seems like a good opportunity for development and will allow me to pay the bills until I find a job in my field. However, I know a lot of companies tend to hide the negative aspects of working for them during the recruiting process and compensate with a higher salary, especially now during the pandemic. I was wondering whether or not some of my concerns are valid.

1. I have no idea what the office inside looks like, but the building itself is absolutely hideous - it makes me question what the atmosphere must be like. I have no idea what type of people I'll be working with for the first few weeks of employment. I don't want to be stuck with jerks or zombies for coworkers.

My thought process was if I got a salary adjustment, my fiancee and I would discuss it more in depth and finally decide when the time would be right (which would primarily be with the salary adjustment since I live in a very expensive area currently, and saving up has almost been impossible.)

So the months go on and here I am at about 9 months as a full-time employee. I get informed last night that I have two options:

**1.)** Move there with a slight salary increase (a super small percentage of an even lower than entry-level salary given 6 years in my field), 12 months of guaranteed employment, and they'd give me a small amount for travel (less than $1,000.)

**2.)** Become a contractor and lose all my benefits (and eventually be pushed out when they found someone more local to them.)

I am absolutely devastated right now. The incentive for moving is not there, and even made worse that I have to pay an absurd amount for a lease break among other financial commitments coming up (we literally just signed for a wedding venue *yesterday*.) Since I couldn't save up a lot I would clearly be going into the red for this move, and as much as my fiancee is well-off financially and can help afford things, I can't place her into this financial burden with me. On top of this, she would have to find a new job there and disconnect from all of her friends and social activities she does. I feel ashamed

On the other hand, going contractor literally feels like I'm losing my job but in a ""nice corporate way."" I would have to get on my fiancee's health insurance through eloping early because I have a reoccurring medical condition and I *have* to have decent insurance for, less I pay an absurd out-of-pocket every year. Then finding a job around where I live would be insanely difficult because the market for my career here is abysmal. I worked too hard for this...

I'm at a loss. I talk to my CEO today in a few hours to hear more about it, but after busting my ass for almost 5 years working 60-80 hour weeks... I don't know. 

I have nothing to ask of anyone, so I suppose this is just a warning to people: a company doesn't give a fuck about you if it means saving them money.

Is he the mentoring type? Or is he only concerned with assigning responsibilities and nothing else? I think knowing the kind person your boss is will be extremely helpful in starting these kinds of conversations.

For example, if you believe your boss manipulated you to work for less than 12-13 dollars, chances are you're not going to get the raise.

But if you believe your boss is a fair/understanding person, I think its very important to ask him to talk about salary. Every boss I have had that's worth a damn has listened very closely to my concerns about compensation.

When/if you do have the chance to speak to your boss, I think its very important to **NOT** focus on the fact he promised you that amount 3 months ago. Chances are he won't even remember. It can turn into a ""he said, she said"" argument that you won't win. If its not written down in paper, it didn't happen.

 I'm not saying that you should pretend that conversation never happened. Rather, I would shift the focal point to something to this: Explain to your boss why you deserve a raise. Convince him that the quality of work you are outputting warrants that extra pay. 

If you can't think of anything, maybe its time to start to document things you have done in the 3 month span that demonstrates your value to the company.

If he brushes you off or tries to ignore the topic of a raise, then unfortunately you have a tough decision to make. Either stay and make less, or leave for a company that pays you your desired amount.

First of all, I definitely understand the struggle as I did not find it easy either and like you, I volunteered at several places and I stuggled securing interviews.

Now, there are few things you might be doing wrong. 


1. NHS vs Private
Searching through Indeed tells me you've mainly looked for private jobs, but most clinics want to hire someone with at least 2 years of experience. This might sound like the easier option but I'd suggest mostly focusing on securing and NHS post first to gain some experience and quality 
training.


2. UP THAT SUPPORTING STATEMENT!! 
This is the one element I found made all the difference for me - this is what secures you an interview. A lot of people don't want to feel like bragging and they might overlook things that would sell you to the interviewer because you've assumed they are normal (Such as managing your independent ward etc). They often are not. You did amazingly well on your last placement? Let them know! You had a really niche research done at uni? Let them know why you chose it - it tells them you're passionate about the profession!
Don't be shy in using words like ""outstanding"" and ""excellent"" in relation to the quality of your work. If you don't convince them you're the best possible asset to them, then someone else will. Recruiters will also think ""if they are so insecure about their skills, then why would we be""?
Also, ask a friend to look at it, even if they aren't PT. After my boyfriend (studying 3d animation) helped me tighten my SS , I got asked for 5 interviews of the 7 jobs I applied for.


3. Have patience. 
It's easy to get discouraged after you don't hear back. Persist and work on your application.

I was really excited about working for a startup. It would be lots of work and it was a major leap after struggling to find a full time job. I’ve been there 7 months or so and over time I was seeing things I didn’t like but thought I’d tough it out.

Now, things are getting bad it feels like. We were just purchased by another company. The CEO and his wife, whom he works with, met with us individually. Not one big meeting, but meeting with employees alone. It was weird but tried not to think too much of it. Yet everything has slowed down. To the point that there is nothing to do. And the CEO does not like seeing his employees not working. He already has an attitude, is quicker to criticize than reward. Priorities shift on his whim. He once said to me “if I find that thing, I’m gonna be pissed. I’ll fucking kill you”. I tried not to read too much into it, but it was shocking. But he talks to everybody that way.

We also have not seen the people who bought us. They have not spoken too any of the employees or anything. Yet we know we will be moving locations. But we don’t know where.

That’s just some of the stuff. It always seemed like there were all these pieces, yet none of them were moving in the same direction.

2165,9ncn0y,False,Startups,12,New job misled me... should I quit or stay for the resume boost?,jobs,"Hi all, TLDR on the bottom. 

 I just got a job at a biotech startup three weeks ago and I thought everything was going great until this week... it seems like they’ve misled me to believe what my job is and what experience and skills I can gain from it. 

When I interviewed, I was straight forward with them and told them I’m doing this for the experience because I have a year experience at a previous startup as an Administrative and Operations Manager and I’m looking to cultivate skills and experience in operations, production management, supply chain, etc. because I don’t want to be an Office Manager/admin worker forever. And I asked them if this is a position that can offer that growth and they reassured me that there’s so much potential for growth in this job. They made it seem like keeping the office tidy was only 15% of my job (office manager... duh) but a couple days ago the VP of Operations that I’ve been supporting and assisting sat me down and basically tried to be casual and say that my job is to keep the office tidy... but I don’t have to worry about cleaning the toilet (his words not mine). Even though we have professional cleaners that come in once a week... this was even listed on the job ad. 

So what I’ve been doing... learning the operations, helping with logistics and the production paperwork isn’t my priority and the majority of my time should be spent keeping the office tidy. 

Later that night, I got an email from the CEO saying that he thinks that the VP got a chance to talk to me, so he just wants to reiterate what my job responsibilities are “moving forward.” And it’s again listing stuff like making sure I sweep, clean the kitchen tables, wipe down stuff... etc. and I also got an email from the VP with “supporting documents” attached saying what my job responsibilities were... #1 &#2 were cleaning related, and then #3 is policing others who prevent me from doing the above... 

So... I feel like I’ve been totally misled because it seems like they just want an office mom and they misled me to believe I would be doing a lot of the management/OTHER business related stuff... not clean. Oh and they don’t clean after themselves... they want me to pick up used coffee mugs, napkins, wrappers that accumulate on their desks. 

What should I do? Do I stay for 6 months and list this on my resume, or should I look for another job?  Of course, I wouldn’t quit until I find another job but... I’m pretty discouraged because I felt like I’ve been doing a really good job with the operations end and this was a slap in the face. 


TLDR: new job misled me to believe my job duties would be more management based responsibilities so I can get experience but they hit me with “supporting documents” to tell me I should focus more on keeping the office clean. 

Edit to add: they had 3/4 other candidates interviewing for the position. But the CEO texted me three hours after the interview to asking if I can do full-Time instead of part-time (since I’m taking classes at a community college for business as well. I already have a degree in Biology btw). So when he asked that, it reenforced the idea of what this company can offer for me.

2166,b4m8ym,False,Startups,5,Unsure about Unpaid Internship at Unlaunched Startup (could lead to a job?),jobs,"I got offered an unpaid internship at a startup by the founder whom I got to know through tutoring his kid. However, I'm  unsure whether this is a legitimate opportunity worth getting involved with, or not.

**Offer:**  
Unpaid internship. After the launch (in a couple months, trying to find investors), would lead to ""part time or full time.""

**Job Description:**  
Data collecting, product testing, maybe email marketing, maybe operations. Basically a generalist I guess. It sounds like there could be a LOT of flexibility depending on my interest, and probably need.

**Concerns:**

1. He's a self-described serial entrepreneur. But he comes from the finance world so he's started advising groups and whatnot, but no ... startups? Does that make sense? And he says he already has one that's paying for itself (can't tell if that means breaking even or profits), but I can't find anything about it online.  
So **unverified, or unverifiable, history of entrepreneurship**.
2. I know that generally ""unpaid internships"" are illegal. If anyone does work to benefit the company they need to get paid. If I take this on, the job description sounds like I should be getting paid.  
Plus, there isn't anyone to learn from which is what interning is about. If I'm figuring things out on my own that's an employee. So I take **problems with both ""unpaid"" and ""internship""**.
3. I don't know how long I'll have to wait until funding then converting to part/full time. Maybe it'll only be a couple months like he said but there's no guarantee. Also, what if I get hired but the offer is too low to accept? I'll have worked free for months with no job at the end. Does that mean I have to discuss my future possible salary *now,* before accepting the internship? **A solid job in the near future is not guaranteed**.
4. Originally I wanted to join a mid-size startup that's in growth stage. I have no special skills (a.k.a. not a software engineer) but that's all the more reasons so I can learn a lot and fast. I'm afraid that if I do this, **couple years later I won't have much to show for** in terms of both specialized skill/career and company recognition (90% of startups fail, after all).

Here are a few reasons why I'm considering it.

* One is that he says there are engineering teams for each company. They may be small but if there's a team I feel like it must be legit. I've also briefly met 2 non-engineers working for him, so that shows there are *real* people working on these (even if they're young & inexperienced).
* He doesn't seem like he's fiscally struggling. He's been regularly paying me for tutoring. His finance side could be floating all of his startups BUT maybe his prior startup really is ""paying for itself"" and his other ventures are working out as well. Obviously he's doing something right even if it weren't his startups.
* I'm interested in startups which is why he gave me this offer in the first place when he found out. It could be a great experience if it goes well. I'm also a grad looking for jobs so just any work that could add to my resume is nice.

&#x200B;

**Options**

I could take it and maybe get a good reference and a line on my resume out of it, while still applying to other things. But in that case, I'd be doing work for free.  
I could take it and wait to get converted to FT and become an early employee of a new startup. In that case I want a guaranteed FT with fair compensation, which I don't know what is. But I don't have enough information to make a comfortable decision.

&#x200B;

I'm going to have a meeting with him next week to discuss more about what I'd be doing, and would like to have some answers by then. Am I worrying myself too much? Or is everything a total red flag? I've no idea.

So I recently started at a small business / startup running the office operations and my boss has been talking more and more about wanting to implement processes/procedures to ease our transition from a small startup-style, two-to-three person passion project to a more organized, efficient operation that can scale upward and not miss a beat. 

I've always worked for small businesses that have prized their ability to adapt and change on the fly, and I don't want to lose that adaptability. However, we need a solid foundation in place and a structure to grow into and expand beyond and I'm a little intimidated being the boots-on-the-ground point person to execute my CEO's vision. 

Any books or resources anyone could point me toward to better analyze my company's workflow and get things running like a well-oiled machine?

This is to protect your personal assets in the event you bankrupt.

Next:  errors and omissions as well as other liability insurances.  At least a million dollar policy.

You will need OSHA insurance too.

After that, begin your sales approaches to anybody in your network. You start part time and work yourself into a full time job.

Meaning, when you make more money teaching than you do in your current job, quit and go full time.  

Things to remember:  depending on where you live, you may collect state sales taxes, will need to file federal and state income taxes quarterly, will have to file for permits in your city, county, to work from home until you move out (check your hoa or lease to see if you can do this).  After you get your first check, you’ll need a corporate checking account (bring your papers with you when you do).  And you will need a way to take credit cards.

Lastly, a website with an your name @ websitename . Com email address is much more professional than some gmail email account.  So find a short, easy to remember name and register it.  Pay the $$$ for email capability.

In total, you’ll need about $5k or so to do this.

If you don’t have it, then you scale back.  Regardless, get errors and omissions insurance.   ",2018-12-21 04:22:55

I have been work for Mid/High Cap companies my entire career so I'm not familiar with working for a startup. I was told that lower salary is expected in exchange for potential future equity in case the company goes IPO. 

I had received an offer letter before that gave me 25k stocks (RSU) but turned it down (later the company was bought at U$2/stock). At that time I was offered a slight increase compared to my base salary then, but I was relocating from a place where salary range is lower than the Bay Area.

My questions are:

1. How much roughly (in percentage) lower on base salary do startups usually pay compared to established, usually public, company? 
2. This one is probably hard to answer, but just an estimated range, how much usually a startup stock worth when they bought out or goes IPO? I was told the usual range is between U$1 to U$4 per stock (in the Bay Area at least).

Need some help regarding my career situation. Some background info:
22M in Canada, in university for Business Degree, has one more year left (8 courses)
Current job: Part time contractor at one of the biggest oil and gas company in Calgary, Canada, making about 50k CAD a year, doing it while in school, I used to intern here and that's why I have this nice gig. I have a lot of coop experiences at big oil companies. Love my coworkers, and my boss, he is the most caring and chill manager I've had so far. I pretty much can stay part time until I graduate and very confident that I will receive a full time offer from this company (already verbally confirmed from my boss) making about 80k CAD right after graduating. The work itself isn't too exciting (IT Application support) but its not demanding at all, I prob only work half of the time and chill for the rest. 
Potentially I have an offer from a startup in San Francisco coming up for this summer, 4-8 months term. They just raised their series A and prob doing their series B this year. I believe in their mission and business model. I will be helping out with their business team doing project management and operation roles. The pay isn't great, like 15 US a hour. They are looking to double their headcount this year and I do think I have a good chance to stay full time after internship. I always wanted to work at a startup because I believe I can learn a lot there vs at a big company since they will be growing really fast. And I love SF as a city, so much more things to do than Calgary. 
My problem: SF is a really expensive city to live in vs where I am now, I am looking at double the cost of living. And 50% pay cut vs what I make now. So every month I am there I will need to put in my own saving while working at that startup. And if I were to leave my corporate job now I doubt I will be able to get it back after. Also there is a chance of full time at the startup which means I wont finish my undergrad degree (1 year left). Talked to my family and friends about it, all of my friends support me to go but my family not so much. They think I should finish school and my job is really good so I should stay at this oil company. But my argument is that if the startup fail I can always come back to school and finish up (you can take 10 years max to finish your degree), and the learning experience/opportunity I will have at that startup is very valuable, I see it as my ticket into the tech industry.

So I just wanted to ask, has anyone left the traditional work force to start a business? What were your reasons? How did it go? 

I’m well aware of the statistics that show that a large number of businesses fail, and probably a large number barely make enough money to be profitable.

So please, post your stories, thoughts, experiences and opinions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ac0efp/leaving_the_corporate_rat_race_behind_who_has/,1,"I didn't quite take the full risk of starting my own business, but I did leave a secure, decent-paying job at a large corporation to work alongside an old business mentor to get a new division at a small business off the ground.  So, we didn't have to deal with the typical admin/legal/accounting side of the equation (my mentor precisely took this opportunity to escape those challenges in running his own ""one-man"" consulting firm), yet we were placed into a sink-or-swim situation with regard to getting the department off the ground; either we became revenue neutral by year end or we probably weren't going to remain a part of the company.

The biggest thing we had walking into that situation was we already had clients lined up to avail themselves of our services so we could begin bringing in money as we developed more business in the meantime.  Similar to starting your own business, we learned quickly that starting our own department meant that we only had ourselves to do the work.  We couldn't afford staff to do the dirty stuff, so if a client needed us on-site tomorrow to dig holes and measure stuff, we were on a plane ourselves to do it.  We didn't have templates for reports, manuals for standard procedures, or software created to meet our needs, so we had to create, develop, and buy every bit of it.  We probably worked 80-100 hours a week in those first few months getting the foundation laid for our department.  We're at Year Two now and only now have things started to settle down as we have managed to find, train, and maintain staff to perform some of our operations for us.  However, there are still plenty of times where my boss or I have to do things personally because of the particular niche in which we work; we don't get the luxury of being too tired for anything because if we don't do it, then it doesn't get done and no one gets paid.

I can only say that my boss and I are workaholics and do get quite a bit of satisfaction from the particular work we do.  It's not for everyone, and I will provide a word of caution that when you own a small business, you still have a boss to whom to answer.  It's just that your boss goes from a single manager or CEO to the client, and clients aren't always the fairest bosses.  Providing a service or product to paying customers often means compromising your own vision or view of how a particular service should be rendered or product should be developed in service of getting those customers to buy it.  You may think yellow wallpaper is ugly, but if your customers want it, then you are stuck choosing between your personal taste and your desire to put food on the table for yourself.  That's not to say you have to completely sell out, but the distinction between a job and a hobby lies precisely in the degree to which you are willing to adapt your individual perspective to meet the needs of consumers who may have a different perspective.

When I interviewed, it was apparent that there were major, major unsolved problems (part of the reason I was brought in), and while they obviously did not reveal the full magnitude of the problems at the time (partially because they didn't know), I thought I was making a ~50/50 bet on joining a company with a viable concept.

2212,8k9z43,False,Startups,6,Torn about leaving a job for another. Better pay vs networking opportunities,jobs,"Three months ago I joined a company that I absolutely despise and draining for the amount they pay me vs the work I'm loaded with. I've been thinking of quitting, although only if I get a job offer so I can sustain myself. 

For a few months now I've been working on a project that I'm really passionate about. Passionate to the point where I work on it on nights and weekends, almost immediately after I get home from work. The project is going really well, I've been doing small tests to show validation and potential, and so far it's been a tremendous success, with those in the tests recruiting others to be in the test as well. 

Unfortunately due to the job work on the project is now almost stopped in its tracks. Due to the amount of work and how its drained me, I barely have the energy to work on it anymore. The weekend now composes of a day and a half of me resting and/or being depressed and unmotivated with half a day working in a slower capacity. 

Due to this I now get angry and frustrated with myself, even my partner has noticed the difference in me before joining vs after I got the job. 

So I've been applying for different jobs and I got an offer yesterday for a 3-6 month contract that pays almost double the current gig, which starts next Friday. (Plus it's something I think I'd enjoy)

You'd think it's easy, I quit and join the new job right? Well, the agency I work for has some very valuable people for networking and such, one such person I've been talking to about my project and they love it so much that they want to help me with pitching and networking. Yesterday I talked with a venture capital, who's *really well connected* that works for the firm as a de facto consultant and after having a long conversation about my project and such, she is eager to help me out in any way, perhaps even personally investing when the time is right (I told her I'm not interested in investment at the moment, the project doesn't even have a name yet). 

I'm worried if I quit then it'll burn the bridges I have with them. At the very least I want to build a solid relationship with them so that when I quit they don't hold it against me.

Now I'm torn on what to do, should I join the new gig and be able to build up savings for when I go full time on the project or should I stay to build my network and potentially connect with some very valuable people?

UPDATE:

Thank you everyone f​o​r you all's advice.

Some clarifications though, I work full-time at the agency and the project I'm working on has been on my own time, with the hopes of turning it into a startup. There's no way I'd even dare work on it while in the office,​ if you've ever watched Silicon Valley it's obvious why.

The contract itself is for 3 months (with a possibility for a 3 month extension but I'm not factoring that in any of this) and I have a barista job offer on standby so I can go into that job almost immediately to help significantly reduce my cost of living and live on the savings I'd get from the contract work for a much longer time.

My rationale is that I would get enough savings within the next three months with the contract job, (hopefully) working on the project on nights and weekends, after it finishes I take a part-time position with the cafe as a barista while I work in almost full blast until it's ready for pitching for investment and accelerators.

Funny enough, earlier in the weekend I was thinking of staying in the agency job to help build the relationships with the two people I've been talking about the project to until it's ready enough that I'd leave/they encourage me to go full-time on it. However, for the past three months since taking the full-time job at the agency, I am fully drained both emotionally and mentally by Friday and need at least one day or even the full weekend to recover. 

Today when I got depressed about having to go back to work on tomorrow, I realized that if I stay at the job and things stay the same, with development in a significantly slower pace than before, I talked with other entrepreneur friends and when they told me that networking will be much more impactful when the app is much further along and that there's plenty of networking opportunities out there, the decision was obvious.

So I signed the offer letter and sent it earlier today, which almost immediately lifted my spirits and I've been quite productive since emailing the letter.

I've emailed the upper management of the agency that I want to talk to them tomorrow about transition out of the company and I'm also going to talk to the two people at the company informing them of my decision, with the hopes that they understand and they'd either still want to help me now or later when things are more developed and networking would be more beneficial. 

Here's hoping I made the right decision...",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8k9z43/torn_about_leaving_a_job_for_another_better_pay/,2,"this sounds like the classic ""bird in hand, two in the bush"" scenario.

what you're choosing between, at the bottom of it, is ""guaranteed double the money now vs. hope of eventual money later.""

if you boil it down to that, which is more valuable to you?  any advice you receive is going to be based on how we would all personally take that bet (or not), and our personal reasons why.  so what you have to do is decide that for yourself.

i can tell you what i'd do in your situation, but i'm not you.   this boils down to your personal goals and priorities. whatever you choose will not be wrong, because it will be what you determine is best for you, based on said goals and priorities.  just be sure you're making the right choice for you, as opposed to the choice strangers might make (based on their personal goals and priorities).

2224,8vbklh,False,Startups,2,Would Paul Feldman’s bagel business strategy be a possible side hustle for a 20 yr old college student?,jobs,"If you've read the book Freakonomics then I'm sure you're familiar with what business I'm talking about. However, if you aren't familiar with Paul Feldman and his bagel business, [here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/magazine/what-the-bagel-man-saw.html) an article that talks about it briefly. Basically what Feldman does is buys bagels in the morning, leaves them in various offices with a collection box asking for one dollar per bagel, and comes back later during lunch time to collect the boxes. For anyone that is unfamiliar it might sound crazy, but it was actually a wildly successful business. He was able to quit his full time job and earn more than he ever did just by depending on peoples' honesty to leave money for the bagels. I believe that he still continues his business to this day in Washington.

A few things to note about myself. I just turned 20 years old, in college, have a part-time job, and just looking for side hustles while in school. I was primarily thinking about targeting elementary, middle, and high school faculty in my district with this bagel service. Leave 2 or 3 boxes of bagels and a collection box in each school's faculty lounge (if they allow it).

My concern isn't so much as to whether people will be honest enough in order for the business to be profitable (Feldman showed that honesty didn't hold the business back from being profitable through meticulous data collection), but rather if breaking into this kind of side hustle is viable or not. Will the startup cost outweigh the profits? Will the risk outweigh the profits? Will it be hard finding clients that are willing to do business? Is this just as a side hustle too much?

So I got hired about two months ago at a hair salon to be the only esthetician and to do facials waxing and lashes. I didn’t have a clients but the owner said do a lot of Facebook and Instagram advertising and things and give out flyers to local businesses and “supposedly” she had a lot of people asking about services saying there was no one in town who does facials or lashes so I would get a lot of people (haven’t gotten that many yet).

It fit my background quite well and I applied and connected with the founder for an informational interview. The founder replied and agreed to a time and date. At the time and date, I never got a call or a follow-up message. 

A few days later, I get an InMail message from the founder saying she saw my application and she thinks it's a good fit and asks to schedule an interview. She seems completely oblivious that she had agreed to the previous interview.

So I give her the benefit of the doubt that she's just crazy busy and inattentive and continue as if nothing had happened just to see where things would go. 

The phone interview comes and it seems to go quite well. I was able to pitch her several techniques I would use to solve some of her challenges.

She follows up a with an email containing technical and behavioral essay questions for me to answer. She asks for things that are outside of the scope of the job listing. But I was able to chalk up an answer anyways. 

She ghosted me for nearly a month afterward despite one followup email the day after. 

Today I receive an email from her with almost the exact technical/behavioral questions. She asks me to respond. It's almost like she had a month-long amnesia and got teleported to a month ago. 

I replied that I would appreciate feedback on my answers. She said she never got it and asks me to send it again. 

I didn't respond and about 12hrs later, she replies the answers I sent her a month ago and says she likes my answers and would like to continue with the interview. 

The founder seems pretty legit. Googling her shows she won a recent competition and she did a postdoc at a prestigious institution. Also, I found a news press from 5 days ago saying that her startup just secured another round of funding from a venture fund backed by Gates and Zuckerberg.

Long story, but the job seemed like a good opportunity to help grow the marketing agency, even though my pay was literally cut in half. I was the 2nd employee, so the first few months I spent working with just the founder and myself in the office.

We clicked immediately upon meeting for the first time. We have very similar personalities, and I was inspired by her motivation and vision for the business. Anyway, a major Catch-22 to working for someone so similar to yourself is that you're not *actually* working for yourself - so the autonomy that I cherished in previous positions has all but disappeared. Although I hold a Management level position (pointless because there's no staff to manage).....EVERYTHING has to be approved by the founder. I'm feeling micro-managed.

I've worked for mostly early stage start-ups in leadership roles and have held had some very fancy sounding titles, including CTO.  Since these were start-ups I'd wear many hats and be responsible for things such as:

-designing and writing software 

-building and deploying virtual servers

-hiring and leading a small team of developers

-reinstalling printer drivers and resetting people's passwords at 2am when they can't get into their e-mail

-helping CEO develop the business plan.  


I'm now interested in leaving the start-up world due to fatigue with the inherent risks and getting a job at a bigger company.

I'm worried that applying for those jobs with CTO in my resume could make HR departments immediately toss out the resume fearing that this is a stop-gap job while I look for another C level position.  I also worry it would color me as having more of a business oriented background and career goals when really I have solid software engineering experience and matching degrees.

Hello r/jobs, I wanted to get your opinion on formal performance reviews at startups. I've had some exposure to this process at a previous employer, but that employer was much larger (~7000 employees, compared to 20-30) and the review process was significantly more established.

For some background, this is my second job out of school and a little over 3 years into my career. I've been at this startup for roughly 1 year 3 months, and no review or compensation increase has occurred yet. This review coming up is the first formal attempt to do so.

I have a title of ""Lead *something, omitted for privacy* Engineer"", and feedback has generally been informally very positive for my performance. I am wondering how to both prepare for a more formal review, and how to get the most out of it, specifically for gathering as much feedback as possible and approaching it with intelligent questions.

I recently applied to another job and was surprised when the poster quickly responded back saying they were impressed with my background. In speaking with them for the phone interview, they mentioned that they were a startup that had just received funding and were in the ""building-out"" stage, with a particular need for my position. If I understood correctly, I would be employee #3-4. I think the idea/product has been implemented and has been in use since ~2008(?), but the company was only put together at the beginning of this year and the founder has basically been doing all of this stuff on his own since then. I should note this startup isn't in cutthroat SF, though it is a software company (nothing like 'the next Facebook' or anything).

I'm *really* eager for a change, and I'm interested in the responsibilities I would have at this company (building out a team, setting foundational processes, etc.), but they are aggressively hiring and looking for someone to start as soon as possible. This has gone from application to final decision in 2 weeks. I feel pressured in that if I ask for additional days to consider, they will go with someone else, which is making me anxious/stressed and wondering if they're looking for the *best* person or the *first* person. (Unsure if this is my anxiety speaking, or the truth.)

So I've been doing research, and I know ultimately this comes down to a risk/reward thing, but I was wondering a few things (I am meeting the CEO for a lunch interview this week):

- What questions would you bring up specifically for a startup that's this early in its life cycle? I've done some research and have a few questions to ask - runway, burn rate - but are there other metrics I need to know? (I'm not too familiar with startup and business terms.) This company is either too new or too below-the-radar for me to find any solid funding information online, although they do have a high retention rate and a decent number of clients. This company has a limited # of competitors, but this company seems to have a more comprehensive/appealing product for the market.

- Is it appropriate to ask about payment? They have indicated that they are looking to make a decision this week, so I'm presumably a top candidate given that this will be my third interview (and both other interviews were very positive, hints of moving forward with me). Essentially, I just want to be sure that I will get a consistent paycheck, at least for the short term as the company is built out, but feel awkward asking about this, even though it's important information and I feel like the company should respect this kind of question. (I am still young and still building out my savings.)

- Is there any other advice for joining a startup that's in such an early stage? I know to expect long hours, doing a lot of business-y things, but am particularly interested to hear of other peoples' experiences. I know there's a significant risk, and I'm tempted to take it since it sounds like it would be a great experience, potentially amazing personal + professional growth, kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, etc., but also I'm usually interested in somewhat established startups, not ones that are literally just getting off the ground.

- Everyone is different, but I'm curious to know - if you were offered a job as a founding member of a startup, would you take it, or would you pass for something more established?

Ultimately a lot will come from meeting the CEO in person this week in terms of how I gauge his personality and what I learn about the company, but I want to be as prepared for this in advance as possible since I will likely need to make a decision if offered ASAP, and I'm struggling to find out exactly how much is appropriate to ask prior to being hired, though I want to make the most informed choice possible. (This may all be moot if they go with someone else, but it's good to know in case I run across something again, and so far the job sounds really promising in my favor!)

&nbsp;

However, technical matters are not my only strength as many may be inclined to conclude. I also have good interpersonal skills and enjoy reading and writing. In fact, prior to graduating college, I excelled as a server at a restaurant and always made the best tips among my contemporaries - I was good at sales. 

&nbsp; 

But I've hit a ceiling financially in my career in corporate, and I no longer wish to be capped by the corporate structure. I never really wished for it, to be honest. If someone had told me 10 years ago I was on a path to be ultimately capped at such a young age, I would have never continued on this road.  

&nbsp; 

Quite honestly, I feel like I'm on the easiest path to a hard life. Of course, I could keep my job for the foreseeable future - I work on millions of dollars in business and outperform my peers at every juncture.  

&nbsp; 

But I know I will never make enough to accomplish some of the primary goals I have - to fix up my old house, to have my wife work less, and to actually afford a vacation per year (I have a huge bank of vacation days each year, and the only vacation I can really afford is the one where I buy plane tickets to visit my elderly parents at their vacation home - it's not a real vacation).  

&nbsp; 

I am considering roles/industries such as public adjusting, corporate real estate, insurance, or perhaps opening a small software development company/consulting firm. But I am not sure these should be all the career opportunities I should be considering. 

&nbsp;  

Can you all shed some light on some potential career opportunities I could perhaps start on my own with my background and skill set? Consider that I could afford reasonable start up costs (ex: buying a McDonald's franchise is unreasonable; renting an office space is reasonable) and am open to acquiring additional skills/certifications/licenses. I am not open to professions that have a clear cap on potential earnings. I'm also disinclined to go back to college. And working for others for an extended period of time (beyond 2 years) is also undesirable.

This struck me as odd at first, but I figured this made some sense since they don't have anyone handling HR on their end. I've decided to look at this as an opportunity to include any and all (reasonable) terms of employment that might be worth considering.

Firstly, is there any standard list of terms which **should/must** be included? and, Secondly what terms would you include?
One that comes to mind would be overtime work, specifically: what constitutes overtime work, how is it requested/approved and what would the pay rate be. Is this a standard thing to include in contracts? I've been bitten by this before but never saw a proper way to handle it.

2258,5m12y4,False,Startups,3,Pressured to sign contract extension (no benefits) instead of promised new contract. Need advice/opinion,jobs,"Hi,


this is a throwaway account due to the fact that my colleagues are heavily using reddit as well.


First of all: I hope this is the right space for this topic and additionally, I currently work in Sweden (originally, I'm from another country). So nevertheless, I still hope for some advice (probably not legal advice due to different laws and so on).


Short intro: I am working for a start-up as an Android developer and I just turned 27. This is not my first job and when I started, I was offered an one-year-contract. It's been a really rough but successful year not only for the company but also for myself. During a feedback meeting a couple of weeks ago (which was also regarding further steps for a new contract) I was overwhelmed by the positivity. My supervisor said that he asked several people in the start-up and continued that 'everybody is really happy to work with' me and 'feeling really confident about' me, and so on, you get the point. Bunch of positive stuff. Nothing negative. When we talked about further steps he said that he promised to give me 'without a doubt' a permanent contract and a raise. (This was actually already mentioned 2 months before that meeting).


(Fyi, in our start-up everybody knows about the salaries of the others and I figured out that I am the lowest payed employee in the engineering part... the next person above me receives around 20,000 USD/year more than me). Of course I should be happy that I have a job and so on. But actually, I don't really earn a lot. I still live in a shared flat and try to save money wherever I can. I actually live like back in university.


Back to the topic: Days after the feedback meeting, my supervisor informed me that plans have changed, also due to the finance department and HR: 
- contract extension for another year 
- same salary 
- no benefits, no bonus, nada, nothing. (Well, apparently it's easier to fire me I figured out while I was reading the info regarding the contract extension.)


I was actually quite shocked and still am. My supervisor then promised me, after I received the contract extension, that I will receive a permanent contract and a raise in a couple of months. Probably by the end of May.


I had a bunch of sleepless nights during the past couple of weeks. I love working for this start-up, I really like my colleagues (there is not a single one I dislike and I am being completely honest here) and I see potential in our product. But right now I don't know what to think. I actually planned this year to move out of the shared flat and find a nice place with my girlfriend, but this won't be possible under such conditions. Also it is quite hard to find a decent place to live at if you don't have a permanent working contract. (90% of the landlords in this area will always take people with a permanent work contract - makes of course sense).


I gave everything during the last year for this start-up. So much stress, unpayed overtime, unpayed work time during weekends, 'work hard & don't party' and also put my health at risk at one point. I feel disappointed in the start-up and partially in my supervisor, because he promised things that he obviously can't keep. And now I feel unsure about accepting the contract extension and wait for a couple of months until I get the, again promised, permanent contract with the raise.
By the way, my contract ends by the end of February, until then I have time to sign the contract extension.


Does anyone of you had similar experience? And if so, how did you handle it or in general, how would you move forward in such a situation?


Thanks so much in advance.


(I hope nobody gets me wrong here, I am really happy to have a steady income. I just have the feeling that my work is not being appreciated, even though there has only been positive feedback).


TL;DR: Supervisor promised 'awesome' contract several times, just made another promise that I will get that 'awesome' contract in a couple of months, instead I get another contract without a raise for a year, feeling 'utilized', not quite sure how to continue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5m12y4/pressured_to_sign_contract_extension_no_benefits/,1,"Well, you have to decide.

2259,620855,False,Startups,2,I'm getting into a soon-to-be startup. I'm worried about several things and I thought that you might be able to help me in figuring out what I should do.,jobs,"Hello r/jobs, 



Before getting started, I need to point out two things : I am not a native speaker so I apologize in advance for the typos I'm going to make and if you could highlight them it would be very kind of you. The second thing is that I don't know if my partners are on Reddit so I won't be really precise about what we will be working on.



That being said, here we go. I[20/M] am a first year european art student and a couple months ago I met a man at a seminar in a prestigious engineering school. We'll call him Tom. Tom is a PhD student, he is about to finish his paper in a few weeks. His thesis, and his work, are related to a new kind of musical instrument. He has been working on it for three years and a half and is now looking into creating a startup. He is currently looking for money and for partners to work with him.

I'm one of the partners he found. But I'm definitely the least experienced one. The others are another PhD student (in a world class engineering school) who will be working on marketing and help in engineering and the last one is a designer/art gallery director.
He has also found money. Some big players believe in the projects and wants to finance it up to 200k€. The final product will be sold between 5k and 10k€.



I have two concerns. First, I have the impression that Tom is overestimating my skills. My task is going to be a lot of programming (I knew what I was getting into though, I know some stuffs in programming but this is clearly next level for me. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would be a 4 or maybe a 5 in programming skills) to design the UX/visual feedback of the instrument. I don't know if I will be able to meet his demands, since the final product needs to look perfectly clean and professional. 

The other concern is about a totally different thing... *Why me ?* I mean, I get along with him very well, we have the same centers of interest (sound, programming and art) but there is an enormous gap between my experience and his. Tom ""hired"" me before even getting to know me. At the end of the seminar I was practically in the team already. At the beginning, I think it was because we could get a scholarship with the partnership our schools have, but it didn't work out very well and as I said, he has found money elsewhere. Today, the both of us have been working on a brainstorming and it was really great. He genuinely seems to be a good guy but I can't stop wondering why he chose me instead of a more experienced guy. 

I saw *Jobs* (the movie) the other day, and maybe I'm overreacting but I feel like this could be about money. Since I'm younger and less experienced, would it be a reason to scam me (the word scam sounds a bit strong but I don't know any other word which could do it) ? If you don't know the story, when he got rich, Steve Jobs didn't give any money to a teenager (and others) who was helping them out at the beginning, because he was ""just a kid"". Yes I know, I'm definitely thinking about this too much.



To be honest, I find this project really cool and interesting. It could really become the next big thing in the world of music and I'm proud to be a part of this adventure - it might not feel that way when you're reading me, but I'm still down to earth and I know it could fail/end at any time - . But I don't know if I'll meet everybody's expectations and it bothers quite a bit. Should I be careful about something ? Share my thoughts with Tom ? Any opinion or advice will be appreciated.

2263,5gydbv,False,Startups,0,How can I move into social media working for a web dev company?,jobs,"I'm mostly placed in sales, inside phone sales. While it's great and I get to talk to numerous businesses who are already fine with their sites, I can't just do this all the time. 

They've asked me for ""ideas"" on what to do to improve their social media. They are quite a specialized web service company, and the majority of their clients are in construction and firms. The chill college gent coworker seems like he's got everything on his hands and wouldn't necessarily want help, it could be that taking some work off his plate can give him some down time which will be boring since our manager is quite strict. 

This is just my hunch as it took him very quick to show me what he does: copy and paste from a built-in sheet, read a blog and copy a part of it to re-post. Make sure to use a picture, rinse and repeat. The manager and him were very keen on asking me: ""so if you have any ideas for improving the social media, let us know"".

I don't think they trust me enough with their social media, otherwise they would have personally gave me a role or a page to manage. How can I give them something that can actually give me another job? It would be neat to have a side-thing to do other than sales. As a casual social media user, who also happen to take multiple relative courses (regarding to social media) I have some ideas... Advice would be welcome...

1. Be their ""graphic editor"", I know AI and both of them do not. Basically, what I tried to do with small businesses as a freelancer was re-design their banners every now and then to fit the season, or even include deals as in writing 50% off on the top right of the banner

2. Be an auditor, I can search for irrelevant social media names/pages that they do not have a reach of (I actually don't want to do this) and report after, then what happens when I complete all?

3. A poll creator, basically have my set schedule on when to post a poll to ask followers, it's some form of engagement right? I could be ""okay here is my poll, can you paste this code to their page please""?

Yes, it's the typical position in where he just copies and pastes and automates. I don't think the introduction to Hootsuite would fly as the main boss wouldn't want to spend extra, he mentioned to me of Followerwonk but I know these types of services cost a subscription and yes, I'd like the idea of introducing this once I insert myself as someone who ""can be useful"" in terms of social media. I need to write the two an email soon, but I've already wrote what I know about social media to the manager, after a couple of days, she introduced me to the social media writer guy.

Lastly, It's a little uncanny that they're just asking me for ""ideas"" but I think the work is already cut out for one person, but what do they mean by ""improving""? I almost want to say that they were reluctant on introducing me a new job. I'd very much like to at least have something else to do, the boss has promised me to expand into social media, didn't actually expect that I'd be asked for ""ideas to improve"" if I haven't even gotten the chance to participate in their automation. At the same time, I'm still unskilled as I have no experience in social media, I'm just a sales clerk but would love to expand.

And I would LOVE more responsibilities, but I can’t take them on because she would rather do things herself than teach me, so I feel like my hands are tied.  What is the saying:  between a rock and a hard place?

It really eats away at my motivation.  I honestly wonder most of the time why they even have me there, because I have periods where I have nothing to do while my supervisor is drowning in work.  I have to remind her to delegate tasks to me, but because there’s so much I haven’t been trained to do, she can only give me so much work before I’m left with nothing to do again.

How can I get over feeling inadequate, or like a waste of space and money because I’m not being used to my full potential, so to speak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gxgmlx/lack_of_training_is_making_me_feel_inadequate/,1,"First of all, there’s no ‘wasting.’ Most people in white collar roles only actually do work a couple of hours per day.

2271,glsc2u,False,Training,13,Am I going to make it in the real world? I keep getting told I'm too slow wherever I go. I got fired from my last job.,jobs,"I'm currently almost 24 years old, and in my senior year of college. I am studying to become a Forensic Biologist. However, it seems that I am slower than the average person during both work and school. I get extended time on tests, because of my Asperger syndrome, and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Without it, I'd fail college.

I got my first job when I was 16 washing dishes (2012). On my first day, I felt excruciating back pain. The pain was so intense, that it slowed me down tremendously, and it caused me to get agitated. Because my Autism was more debilitating back then, I wasn't able to properly communicate exactly how much pain I was in. I got a call from my boss telling me not to come back again. I did not attempt to convince him otherwise.

At my second job at Mcdonald's (early 2014-2016), I was initially too slow. When I got assigned breakfast duties for the first time, I initially got sent home twice for being too slow (they told me it was because of high labor). I suspected there was something wrong, and talked to the managers. I eventually did pick up the pace, and I worked there for 2 years. I had to quit, because my mental health got out of control.

At my second job, as a busser a nursing home (2017-2019), I almost got fired, because I got worked up very easily. This is because I was paranoid from my near-firing at Mcdonald's. Two months later, I decided that I wasn't going to care about my work speed. I ended up becoming a very valuable employee. I worked there for 18 months. I left, because I graduated Community College.

I got a job at KFC last summer, but I quit after only 25 days. It was horrifically understaffed, and I was insecure about my speed again. The manager was also a toxic person who didn't know how to run a business. The other employees were also very unprofessional.

Last December, I got a job as a cashier at Speedway. During the summer I had been put on Immediate Release Seroquel to help me sleep. However, all it did was make groggy during the day. I warned my boss on the first day that if I was too tired, I could get off the medicine. I was fired after two days, because my grogginess made me take too long to complete the computer assessments. When she made the decision to fire me, I had not yet interacted with a single customer. She also gave me no hint whatsoever that there was anything wrong with my performance.

This semester, I got reprimanded for taking too long to complete a lab in Organic Chemistry.

A couple videos about the new policies regarding safety due to the on going Covid pandemic. On the final day/ pre opening of the store, we got a super brief rundown of what they expect us to do up in front. They told us how the new self checkout system works, how to return items, how to fix mistakes, remove items.. etc.. They also told us that we must keep track of how many people are in the store at a giving time and all this other important information. All of this new info was literally dumped on us new guys without anything else to go by, no scenarios, no hands on training, nothing! Just 30 minutes, or less of the manager explaining to us what’s going to happen.. this has been the most barebones training I’ve ever received! Do they really expect us not to mess up somewhere ?

Would not mind getting into PenTesting later on down the road, but my question is, if I were to put the time to study for the A+ test first (and then work my way up), would the certification increase my chances of getting better pay? My current experience is in customer service, mostly entry-level stuff, usually between $14.00 to $16.00 per hour.

I'm in the United States. Based on the job postings I'm seeing it looks like this certification could help me land jobs in the $20.00 per hour range, but I wanted to know how the certification fit into the bigger picture, maybe get some different viewpoints.

I would like to go back to school and get a degree in something, but for now I need to concentrate on staying self-sufficient. Computers have been second-nature to me, and I've helped others build theirs, so the tech stuff doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.

Thoughts? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g7aow6/how_relevant_are_comptia_certifications_in_todays/,1,"Yes, these are still relevant and they do help you stand out compared to other applications who don't have them.  I would definitely hire someone with 2 years non-it work experience and one or two comptia certs over a guy with 0, 1, or 2 years of entry level IT work and no certification.  Plus, it's WAY cheaper than a degree and these certifications do require you to do some continuing education where degrees do not.  Given the low cost, you really can't lose.  If you already know a lot of the material, check out professor messer on youtube - he offers a free video course, but it's fast paced and he's always saying ""buy the $35 notes"".  If you don't know the content well, go to your local community college's continuing education department (not the for credit or seeking degree courses) and get the hands-on experience taking things apart and putting them back together or cutting and terminating ethernet cables, etc.

2298,fblpum,False,Training,8,Should I be worried? Should I bring this up with my TL or boss?,jobs,"I am not sure about the flair.

Anyway, a little background: I have been an events graphic designer for a company for a little over a month, that has like 70+ events in a year. 

My coworker (A) who is another graphic designer that handles awards in my department told me last Friday that our TL (S) is thinking of hiring another designer to help me with my tasks. But A said that S doesn’t know how to word it to our marketing head/”the boss” (U) without making it sound like a skill problem. Because what if she asks why I can’t handle the tasks by myself? Is it because of my skills or lack thereof? 

The way my job works is that two people from the marketing team (one for summits and one for conferences) sends me design briefs, so I do BOTH the event designs for the summits and conferences. From A and S’s perspective, if the marketing team can have one person for each event, why can’t we have one designer for each instead of me doing both. Note that the person that does the conference marketing is having a difficult time because of her workload.

I’ve been here five weeks. I admit I’m still kinda slow and overwhelmed. However, I was called up by U a day before A told me about what S was thinking of doing. U asked how I was doing because I have been there a month already. She asked if I was overwhelmed, and my go-to response was no. In retrospect, maybe I should have been honest and told her that sometimes I am because of the fact that I am still new and that events overlap with each other so basically I have to do a lot of things for different people at the same time. But IDK, it just felt like the right answer to it was “no” at that time. My thought process was I didn’t want them to regret hiring me because I am incapable of juggling my workload.

On to my tasks… So, what happens when people send me design briefs (DB), is that I or my TL lists them down on this excel to-do list and distribute them throughout the week or the next according to the given deadline. 

**I think my biggest problem is that I tunnel vision**. Like, I only focus on what I’m doing at the moment (usually what’s written first on the list) and then move on to whatever is written next. Also when I get a new DB throughout the day while I’m already doing something, I tend to put off replying to it because I can’t do everything all at once. A, S, and I have different shift schedules. I am left last and sometimes when I am faced with a branding I am unfamiliar with and I have no designers to ask help from, I tend to panic and ask non-designers for help. Sometimes it’s no use as they don’t know the answers either. 

I thought about this last Friday and maybe it would help me a lot if I checked all the DBs for the day *before* starting on anything. If I do that, then I would know what questions to ask the requestors, what files to ask for, what I need help with, and which ones to prioritize before S goes to bed and A leaves the office. Also when I get a new DB when I am alone, I won’t get overwhelmed because I’d know where to put it on my priority list. 

With that said, I do work really hard and try my best to meet the deadlines but sometimes I can’t and have to move them to another date. When I have a lot to do, I can barely quality check before sending them to the requestors. Also the company’s filing and naming systems are still something I am not used to. The email subjects sometimes have acronyms but the design briefs do not and the folder where I am supposed to upload them are named differently as well. We have templates I can use but the file names are so confusing that I can’t find them without someone’s help. That’s really frustrating for me and something I still haven’t gotten used to. People have been super nice and helpful but sometimes they give me impatient vibes, especially S who hired me and is currently training me. An example would be how she responds to my questions, she goes “Giiiirl, that is X. You can find that in the X folder.” Maybe I ask stupid questions, or the same ones and I’m too “slow” for her. I go to her as a last resort now when no one else can answer my questions.

So, I was wondering if I should bring the” hiring a new guy” thing with my S (remember that it was A that told me about hiring a new person not her) and maybe ask her for a productivity review? What exactly do I say? And maybe tell U (marketing head/”the boss”) the truth, the who asked me if I was overwhelmed.

Should I be worried? Maybe they had really high expectations of me when they chose me. And maybe I’m not meeting those expectations. What if I get fired? I actually really enjoy this job even if it is stressful and it would suck to be let go this early.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fblpum/should_i_be_worried_should_i_bring_this_up_with/,1,Hey thats excellent news!

But I highly doubt there is any engineer jobs that have paid training outside of the military. In terms of technology jobs in general, there isn't really any significant paid training outside of your training when you first get the job. They're usually only hiring people people who have some skill in their field whether through a degree or certificates. 

If you're interested in non tech related fields, there's paid training in a lot of job fields that don't have a ton of movement upwards but are generally hurting for workers, usually labor intensive. The major trade jobs such as electrician, plumber, sheet metal, pipe fitter, etc, usually have apprenticeship programs you have to apply for. HVAC apprenticeships are usually just low level labor positions with HVAC companies, but they'll definitely train you. Any sort of job that has the title ""field service technician"" usually has extensive paid training. 

The best option is engineering school. If you're smart enough to do it, it's pretty hard to be unemployed. Even if you can't find that sexy 60k entry level engineering job, whatever your field is, electrical, computer, mechanical, etc, there are companies that will hire you to do something. If you don't think you're smart enough to do engineering school, trade school is the best option. A lot of trades are in need of workers as over the last 10+ years people went to get professional degrees. But not only that, you can go to trade school for a 'non-trade' Such as IT, accounting, or something in the medical field. Trade schools are also usually pretty good at getting students lined up with jobs before they even graduate. ",2020-03-03 03:46:22

I have had many internships in such jobs before and love growing plants, but this new job has me more stressed than I have ever been in my life. I come home depressed and paranoid that I did something wrong while at work and will get chewed out for it the next day. Basically my job is to watch about 30-50 greenhouses with new very delicate propagation plants. If any of these houses do not get mist during the day, within 15 minutes they can be damaged or die. Many things can happen, irrigation booms can crash or blow fuses, they could be programmed incorrectly, electricity can surge or drop out for just a little bit which can stop the booms, so we have to constantly be driving around in the farm truck and checking them. I feel like I was undertrained and just thrown into this position but like I said it's my first ""real"" job in the industry so I'm not sure. My boss spent a total of about half a day showing me around and trying to teach me to program booms (there are 3 different software systems to learn) and the rest of what I've learned has been from my coworkers, who were expected to answer all my questions and teach me things while also trying to do their job and watch their own 50 greenhouses. As a result, I felt very much like a nuscance with all my questions especially in the beginning, and made quite a few mistakes because I didn't know any better. On top of that we work in shifts with partners and mine gets very annoyed with me if I make any mistakes at all. As a result I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around my coworkers and am constantly afraid of messing up. The other day we had an electrical problem and some of our plants were damaged, and later I heard him talking badly about me to our other coworkers. Also, whenever my boss sees I have made a mistake he automatically assumes it is because I'm being lazy or not checking my plants and irrigation enough. Now that the growing year is winding down and daylength is shortening our schedule has changed and I am scheduled to watch the entire farm by myself every other day, 10 hour shifts. I was in no way trained to take care of the other parts of the farm, it is completely foreign to me and I feel like I have been just thrown in to sink or swim. I was given a check list and talked to for 10 minutes about what I should do to care for the other part of the farm, but only because I asked. If I hadn't asked I would have gotten nothing. I would have felt much more comfortable shadowing someone else do it for a bit.... What should I do? This job has me so burnt out with worry it's not funny.

**Context:** I work for this smallish tech company that has about 300 employees. The company culture is still start-up like because of their size. I am a communication systems engineer. I have pretty much been working on the same assignment with slightly different variations for the past 8 months.

The first 3 or 4 months went by extremely quickly as I was learning new things non-stop like how to interface with the product, learning Python and all of the company's internal codebases, figuring out how to set up instruments properly to capture data, fixing problems as I uncovered them, etc.

The next 2 months slowed down but I used it as an opportunity to go back and really iron out all the stuff that I had worked on previously. I prettied up my testing scripts, made them easier to debug and extend, and spent a lot of effort figuring out how to best display my testing results so that others would understand.

For the last 3 months, I have been doing nothing useful at work. I had enough free time that I was able to fully automate my tests which ... means I have even less to do. I have been coming in late and only leaving slightly later than normal to offset that, but I really feel like the weeks go by without me having done any actual productive work. I keep asking my boss for more assignments to work on, but most of what he assigns are a slight variations of stuff that I am already doing.

He tells me that he wants me to get trained on other parts of the systems we're working on but hasn't made any time to do so. What has been happening is he runs through a quick explanation and points me to an out-of-date resource to read on my own time. I quickly realize that the resource doesn't apply to the project's current status and I explain it to him. He's a bit surprised and tells me that he's a little busy but that we should have a conversation about how to proceed later. I flag him down at a later time and the cycle repeats itself.

I'm getting really anxious because of the lack of work and direction. Is this normal? I've tried offering to help other people around the company too but they usually don't have stuff for me to do.

2339,dvi3i9,False,Training,0,Trying to build skills on a low budget with less than great hours.,jobs,"I graduated in May with a design degree and I ended up taking a job at a coffeehouse while I kept looking for work. I was hoping to figure out where I wanted to specialize as a designer so I could better market myself and improve on my craft (Also it turns out that my year was the last year my college would offer my program, so yay! /s). I did eventually sorta figure out that I like working with textiles and as well as working on UX/UI. I was hoping that my time working in food service would only be tempory but it now been over 6 months and nothing has really come to fruition. I want to end up doing something that is meaningful and pays the bills, but I feel like I never have the time, money, or energy.

 I wanted to work on retooling some of my old portfolio pieces that I made in college, but I haven't been able to do so because Adobe is ridiculously expensive when not paying student prices. I've ran into the same issue with textiles because cloth isn't cheap and even the budget-esque practice of making a muslin so as to not use more expensive materials is still more than I can justify as of current. I've been spending money on paying for a domain name that never left a private setting thinking that I could make a blog/ online portfolio site to better promote myself but never could really get everything to run right. I feel like I'm held down by a ton of financial barriers, and that isn't including that I need to start paying back student loans this month.

Time is also a major constraint at the moment. I don't have a car which forces me to use a less than substantial bus system. On average I'll spend 30 minutes a day heading into work, and depending on when I get off, I can end up spending over an hour to get home like I did last night.  I live in the midwest and the temperature has been at or below freezing for a week now. Its really not even properly winter yet, since temps can hang around 0 degrees Farenheit for months. Honestly just having to commute ends up draining a ton of energy, especially when I realize that if I did have a car my commute would take around 20 minutes for a round trip. Being reliant on the bus schedule also limits where I can search for a job and what hours I can work, because the bus cut off before 8pm and run on an hourly schedule. Even if money were not an barrier, I would still be at the mercy of a rapidly fluctuating schedule that leaves me feeling unable to work on anything because I'm constantly having leave far earlier than I need for a shift in order to actually be on time.

In short, I feel that I can make something out of my skills and creative drive but I dont have the time or money necessary to do so. I'm currently looking for a better paying job that has me work more regular hours but so far I've been striking out.

two weeks ago i was hired on as a shipper at a local warehouse, there are a number of them around so they sent me off to get trained in another building a city or two over.

From the very start i was given very little explanation on how to do anything and whenever i asked a question i was given an exasperated sigh and retold the same thing i was just told which doesn't explain the task only how to complete it, not what im doing, just push these buttons, input this number, press enter.

i figured it was a bad day but it went on like this for 2 weeks with my trainer steadily growing more and more angry with me but not telling me anything, I had no idea what i was doing to make them upset so in the end i basically just shut down and waited to be told what to do, I did have a moment or two of extreme frustration bordering on anger because I had no idea what i was doing and ever question was answered with something like ""that's just what we do""

2353,cq5ekc,False,Training,4,Managers at new job give me anxiety??,jobs,"I work at a tea shop and have had prior experience at a different cafe. I got hired, I assume, because of my prior experience. The place I work at now is relatively new, having been opened at the beginning of the year, and I know that they want to uphold a good reputation within the community so it's important for the owners (the 3 of them own/manage the store) to keep the drinks in consistent flavor and quality.

I know that they probably had high expectations since I've worked at a different cafe before and therefore have had similar experience, but the thing is that the process for making drinks are radically different. I do have some transferable skills, but for the most part 90% of getting things done right is memorizing the new recipes and techniques.

So far I've worked 3 shifts (technically 4 but my first shift was mostly training so it wasn't a full shift of me working). Today was my 3rd shift.

The issue I'm having is that 2 of the 3 managers are giving me anxiety about messing up. Again, I know that they want their products to be the best that it can be, but it doesn't help when I can tell they're getting angry at me for it. When I get anxious, my mind pulls blanks and I stand there staring, trying to think about what to do but at the same time my mind isn't thinking at all. It just freaks out. I've only worked with the 3rd manager once and because he was so chill, I was able to relax and think through the recipes. I only made one minor mistake that day. I know he oversaw me make drinks, I know I didn't struggle as much as I did today.

For example, there are ""cheat sheets"" on the wall to help baristas make the drinks. There was a seasonal drink I had to make, and being new, I was looking at the wall to double check to see how to make it. My manager saw me and mentioned something like, ""You're still looking at those? That's not good."" and shook her head, despite this drink being a ""special"" drink. To me this was absurd because a) I'm new, and b) no one taught me how to make this drink; it's not a staple drink that is popular and is in stock year round so I'm sure even the baristas that had been there for a while would have to take a peak at the recipe. But the comment that bothered me the most today was when the other manager said to me, ""if you worked at another tea place shouldn't you be picking up on this faster?""

I don't know how to calm myself down when they watch me make drinks anymore. It's a minimum wage job, it's close to my house, and I'm a college student who needs money. I'm terrified to get back to work or even to get fired, and after today I was debating on quitting before they get the chance to fire me.

My supervisor said that was fine, just be honest with people that you don’t know their technical questions, and just point them to whatever item they’re looking for. 

Today, when my sup went to lunch, I was left alone to cover the department and had a customer asking for a specific kind of wire. Only being there a week, I’m not at all well versed in what wires we have, or what they do, so of course the customer got upset. 

And that’s fine. I’ve done retail before. I can handle people being rude or dicks. But this customer went to the front to complain about me, and when the employee they sent back with him couldn’t find what he was looking for, he went to a different apartment to complain. 

When the supervisor came back from lunch, I told them what happened and they were very sympathetic and understanding and basically told me to brush it off, before going to tell the neighboring department’s supervisor what happened. 

My confidence was already low working somewhere I’m not familiar with, and being berated by a customer is always rough, but now I’m embarrassed the two departments surrounding me know what happened as well. My day was shot basically, and I hid as much as I could until my shift was over.

I enjoy working there, but from the beginning, some things seemed a little bit shady. 
I'm a young adult trying to save enough to be self-sufficient. I pay for most of my expenses already. When I first interviewed the manager stated I would work ten to fifteen hours a week. While the small amount of hours and pay would make living more difficult, I agreed. I'd just cut back on unnecessary spending. 




So for the first two weeks, aside from one day of training, they never scheduled me, then gave me one four-hour shift in the next two weeks. Since then they've only been giving me eight or nine hours a week. I got my paycheck, and there was no training wage in it. I thought that was odd, but decided to wait and see if the mistake would be resolved the next check. It hasn't, and on top of that, it says I've only worked eight hours this whole year when I know I 've worked more. 




There's a lot of other weirdness too. I applied to be a cashier but they don't let me use the cash register. When they say they need people to cover shifts, when I volunteer, they suddenly don't need anyone. I just got a text from the manager telling me and a few other workers that we suck (her words.)

I'm going to wait a few more weeks and see if the weirdness all resolves itself, but I can't shake the feeling that they don't really want me. I don't know if this is normal for working part-time in California, and I'm afraid other places would be worse. I just don't know.

2. The accelerated program is 5 days a week, 6 or 7 hours at an off site location, hands on training at a Habitat for Humanity home construction site.

I have a degree and worked in the corporate world for a few years and then decided to switch and pursue work in the trades. I am not working currently and living at home in order to take these classes, and to find work in the field after time, I am 28 years old.

Will working in home construction LEAD to specialization and/or good skills or would I basically be busting myself for a quick career that wont have too much progression ?

Thrown on reg without being able to study produce codes in a busy supermarket. My spotters could barely speak English so many of my questions went unanswered. Berated all day by customers (even the nice ones commented). Awkward set-up of reg counter causes agony in the lower back after a couple hours, took the bus home instead of walking because of the pain. Am I being a baby? I'm used to busting my ass (former waitress), but at the moment I'd rather physically run headlong into a truck than show up for work on Wednesday.


EDIT: Sorry for the length, really had to get that out.


Hello all! Today was my first day at a busy local supermarket and it was god awful: I mean, it's my first day so I didnt expect things to be perfect, but damn.

Anyways I came in and was handed 5 pages of codes that I had to memorize (plus an additional 50 more since mix nuts is self serve now). I was nervous, but knew I would get it down with repetition and would have some time to practice before I had to do anything too challenging...or so I thought. Without any time to even glance at the codes I was put on a register while an experienced cashier spotted me. It was okay in the beginning since the morning was slow, but everything started to fall apart once the rush(es) started coming in.

People would come through with carts filled with produce, most of which I didnt know the codes for, so I desperately tried to memorize all these codes as they came at me, but I struggled all the way through. My spotter got to the point where she basically was just telling me all the codes without letting me try to memorize because she got annoyed. About 80% of the customers I had were talking shit, and even the nice ones just had to say something to my spotter about me being new. Also, I should mention that the two people I was bouncing between all day speak really broken English so a lot of my questions weren't understood or were misunderstood. 

I was simultaneously told to slow down and take my time (probably had to call my manager 10 times today because I was anxious and hitting the wrong keys), but also felt a huge pressure to speed up because the place was packed, the lines were getting long, and I know I was slowing things down. One of my spotters was asked by a manager how I was doing and I told her to be honest; she said something in Spanish about my speed and the manager wouldn't translate for me.

I'm afraid what this job will do to my health. The cashier counter is set up in a way where you have to lean forward to be able to reach product and scan it or else you will hit the conveyer belt button. Within my first hour and a half my lower back was screaming at me; I was able to rest it during my breaks and lunch, but it wasnt long until it started up again. I was able to walk to work since it isn't far, but today I took the bus back home because I was in so much pain from leaning all day that I couldnt walk without hunching over. I also know carpel tunnel is a problem with cashiers and one of them was telling me how she had to get surgery for hers; this didn't help her and only made things worse. If I'm in agony after one fuckin day I'm afraid of what will happen to me in a month or two. I've been getting into running lately and I dont think I can run with pain like that.

I am finding this extremely demoralizing. I worked at this place as a courtesy clerk from 2014-16 and left because the workplace politics were toxic and the managers were in on it. Years later I have had to come back because the job I took afterwards asked way too much, but refused to hire the proper amount of staff to handle the workload (still did it for 2 years though). The job I took after that one hired me full time only to have me (and everyone else there) work only several 4 hour shifts a week and sometimes you only got one day for the week. I looked for full time work, for months, but NO ONE is hiring for full time, so I eventually had to come crawling back to this place; seeing that many others I worked alongside years ago are still here in the same positions makes me feel trapped and hopeless.

It just sucks you know? I messed up and was forced to go back to a toxic environment to help make ends meet. I resigned myself to it and was looking forward to saving up money to finally get started on the next phase of my life, but it's worse than I imagined and I cant afford to leave. Even if my back ends up shot and my nerves frayed, and my self esteem beaten into the ground I have to do this. I dont mind being a cashier, but I'm not suited to this environment. I feel like I'm being a whiney baby, so please, tell me its going to get better.

For PLUs, make a cheat sheet with receipt paper and put it at eye level with tape if possible. If that isn't possible, you can sit it at another empty spot on your register. When I was being trained, I was told to write the most commonly purchase PLUs (apples, bananas, potatoes, mixed nuts, self serve candy, etc, etc). It's a lot easier to look at a cheat sheet of 20 for a PLU than thumbing through five pages that has a horrible naming system (i.e. green beans being under B for beans green, but kidney beans being under K).

&#x200B;

The expectation for you to be fast on your first day is ridiculous. If a cashier is fast on their first day with no previous experience, they're doing something wrong. Believe it or not, it's a skill and like any skill, you get better with practice and you lose it when you don't use it. Also you are not a burden to your coworkers. Even with my slowest coworkers, at the end of the day, I'm just happy I got some help.

&#x200B;

For your health, shoes, a weight belt, and the most important move. Whenever possible, walk around your register. Also if you need to sit down go to the bathroom. At my old store there was a small seating area for breastfeeding slightly separated from the bathroom. On days when the pain was unbearable I would go sit there once the store died down for about 3-5 minutes.

&#x200B;

As for working in a toxic work environment, leave as soon as you can. If you can't then talk to your coworkers and build a friendly relationship with those who are trustworthy. Stay away from gossiping and be friendly to all your coworkers, even the toxic ones. Remember, this is not your permanent job. It will get better. ",2019-04-02 02:39:19

I realized what interests me the most is the Neuroscience field. I've been on hiatus from a university for about 4 years now and have been working since.

I worked as a restaurant line cook and even did a year of a culinary program at one point because I thought I enjoyed cooking enough to really learn as much as I could. I realized though, I no longer want to work in the restaurant industry. 

I currently work in the manufacturing field. I've wanted to explore jobs that are more hands-on just to earn a solid paycheck and maintain hobbies outside of work.

As background, I am the social media copywriter responsible for all the social media captions, giveaways, YouTube descriptions and everything related to online presence. Meanwhile my boss - who just quit - was the Marketing Copywriter and wrote product descriptions, sales, ad copy and more. However, I would often help out with her duties so I'm trained on all of it.

This week they hired a new Marketing Copywriter with 25+ years of experience, although none in makeup or e-commerce. I was fine with this and figured she would be a big help to me, until I found out I had to train her since I'm the only copywriter left in the company. 

It's been an absolute nightmare. I've tried my best to explain the work to her, but she just isn't getting it. She keeps asking the same questions over and over when I've answered them multiple times, or asking about things that aren't even relevant. ""Why can't I see this copy in the email?"" ""Why does it do that?"" ""Is that right?"" She also has no clue how to use technology. She straight up asked me how to start a new document on Google Drive - which is how we communicate at work - and doesn't understand the concept of sharing files. She doesn't understand Basecamp, Slack, anything.

Even when it comes to writing she's pretty mediocre. For instance, a recent sale had a theme of sparkly makeup and summer and she asked me ""How do we write it with a double theme like that?""

2372,co5wyl,False,Training,1,How to speak and write smoothly and articulately in both English and Russian and become employable?,jobs,"Hiyah. I'm 22 y/o Russian native guy. Just came back to Moscow after studying for 6 years in US Florida, and I kinda speak fluently both languages, but not really. Today I lost a Russian job offering on a really good position because my written test assignment had too many mistakes in Russian, which was ""unacceptable"", said by HR manager, who I agree with. I haven't practiced my Russian outside of chatting with friends and family members and I guess it's become a lot rougher. I mostly do everything in English now, but even that isn't perfect. As a non native speaker I have a lot of issues with pronunciation, accent, and word choice.

I would like to polish both languages and become employable, so I'm trying to organize my thought process and what my next steps should be. I'm going to start reading Russian literature, so as of today I'm picking up Dostoevsky! And for English, I need to read a lot more books too, and the area I'm lacking the most is speaking, so I need a lot of practice on that too, but I'm really unsure on how to do that in Russia. Maybe finding and hiring English native/fluent, public speaking specialist, but I don't know.

I don't have great education or experience, so I would like to sell my fluency in two languages as a skill to get some experience in corporate environment. I can't really do that if I can't prove it. I feel like a mess. I want to get my career going.

2373,cyfmgl,False,Training,0,"Please HELP! My new job lacks organization, structure, and training. How do I discuss the issues with my employer?",jobs,"Let me preface and say that I'm currently in the processes of changing my career field. My background was mainly in business and merchandising. I did exceptionally well in the field, but it wasn't fulfilling nor was it my true passion. So, a few years ago I decided to make the big leap and pursue my true calling in life- Nursing! I completed my pre-reqs as of June and I'm currently in the process of applying to different schools. I wouldn't start my program till the beginning of next year, so in the meantime I decided to start an entry level job position doing administrative work in a clinical setting. I was hired as an executive assistant for a behavioral healthcare facility for kids and this past Wednesday was my first day. I was so excited because I also have previous experience working with children and want nothing more, but to be a pediatric oncologist one day! This job would be a great way to get one's foot in the door!

The tasks of this job are nothing new to me. Create a marketing plan, make travel arrangements, purchase merchandise for facilities, schedule and conduct interviews, and support front desk as needed.  No problem I thought! Boy, was I WRONG. As mentioned, Wednesday was my first day on the job. 9 AM - 2 PM.  I arrived on time in the morning and the executive assistant (Helen, we'll call her) whose job I would be taking over greeted me. Helen is going on maternity leave in October and she is the directors right hand. The director informed me that she would be out of town for the week and that Helen had a wealth of knowledge to provide me. So, I expected lots of information and training from Helen.

My first day consisted of a tour of the facility, introduction to some staff members who were there that day, and brief information. I was then plopped in front of the computer to schedule interviews for various job positions that I didn't know much about. Helen assured me that I had everything under control while she left to support the front office in another room. I went  through the notes Helen provided me and realized that she didn't cover many things. What were the candidate requirements? Did they need a college degree? Certain amount or type of experience? Any certifications? What did the various job positions even entail?  Also, Helen was allowing interview walk-in's based on the previous emails she sent. Something I have not seen before. So, I made a list of questions and went to ask Helen. Helen was unclear and short with answering my questions. She looked annoyed with me and it was apparent that she didn't have many if any requirements for potential candidates. Also, the information on the various job positions were very brief. So, I went with the flow and tried my best to send interview requests to people I thought were best qualified.

The second half of the day, I was asked if I was comfortable interviewing the walk ins. I said no because I still didn't have a good grasp on what their expectations were as far as qualified candidates, various job details, and interview style they wanted. So, I took notes by shadowing Helen, the HR manager, and HR assistant as they conducted interviews. Well, what I learned was that although HR & Helen had similar interview styles, they had very different expectations on who is qualified for the various job positions. When I asked about this, they went back and forth with one other and came to no conclusion. By the end of the day I was confused more than ever and had fragments of information coming left and right. Helen then told me she would not be in tomorrow, Thursday. Nor would she be in Friday. She expected me to continue scheduling and conducting interviews, assisting front desk as needed, create a marketing plan, and request quotes for customized merchandise. Helen assured me that I had it all under control and that the scheduler at the front desk would be helping me out on my second day. HR would also assist with the interviews and if I needed anything else that I could text Helen questions. Before leaving that day I asked Helen to email me further information I needed. She agreed.

Thursday and Friday were complete madness. Two members of the staff had emotional break downs in the front office. One kept threatening to quit and ultimately did the same day. The other was the scheduler who showed up late and had received bad news the previous day. People kept calling trying to get in contact with the scheduler and were frustrated that she wasn't returning their calls and I didn't have the information they needed. So, instead of the scheduler helping me on my second day, I was helping her while she took constant breaks leaving me alone at the front desk. Then, I realized Helen didn't give me all the passwords I needed to access certain accounts and information. Nor, was I told where certain documents would be or materials in the office were stored. One of the front desk phones was broken on top of that.

Next, I had walk-in interviews show up throughout the day and that's when I realized just how crazy it was that they have open time frames where people walk in for interviews. In addition, Helen evidently did not have any of this under control because she was making errors such as interviewing the same people twice. Furthermore, no one ever knows who or when they are assigned to conduct an interview. HR could only help me to a certain extent and I found out they were asking interviewers illegal questions. So, not only was I more confused, but also falling behind completing my other tasks. As a result, I had to work off hours without pay to finish these other tasks.

Helen wasn't answering important questions through text and there were constant delays in whatever she did choose to respond to. On top of that, she failed to email some information to me that I requested Wednesday when I left the office. She then proceeded to argue with me that she did in fact send it to me. She did NOT. While trying to get quotes for custom merchandise on the phone, staff was yelling and screaming in the front office. Instead of working till 2 PM for Thursday and Friday as I was told. I ended up having to stay till 5 PM as requested the last minute because things were crazy. Therefore, I didn't have much of an opportunity to take a break because of the madness and had not brought lunch. I nearly fainted on Friday as a result of overwork and failure to take a break. HR manager was not understanding at first when I was fumbling over my words, until I nearly fainted. I let HR manager know when they came to check on me afterwards that I was very unhappy with the lack of structure, organization, and training. He didn't offer much of a solution and left for the day shortly after.

To say I was livid would be an understatement. I'm an individual who thrives in fast-paced detail oriented environments. But, this was absolute madness and I've never been more at a loss for words. The clinical assistant (Carrie we'll call her) informed me she was aware of the issues with the center and would request a meeting from the director next week when she comes back. Carrie let me know that the HR assistant and herself were also struggling with similar issues and that she did not want me to quit. So, here I am glad not to be alone, but questioning what on earth I just signed up for. I really want to make this work because it's not only a great opportunity, but the mission of this facility aligns with the values I espouse. I know there are many ways I can contribute, but I'm not willing to share my connections and sacrifice my health for a business like this. What is the best way that I can convey all of this to the director in the meeting next week?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cyfmgl/please_help_my_new_job_lacks_organization/,1,,2019-09-01 21:10:39

If you have experience with edX and their certificates, I'm would love to hear about it!
",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a08dqv/is_an_edx_course_certificate_worth_buying/,45,"edX certificates range in price from around $50-$100. So if you are just paying for the certificate I would say definitely not worth the price.

Like other said prospective employers and anyone else will believe you when you say you have done the course and you can show a screenshot of the congratulations page when you finish the course if you need proof.

I do think that in some cases paying for the certificate is worth it and that is because it also unlocks *more features* in the course.

Some skills are hard to learn. When you pay for a certificate you also get access to more of the exams and you will have your assignments graded.

This **feedback** is often invaluable to see if you are making progress or just following the videos.

Another good way to decide if you want to invest the money is to think of how much *your time is worth*.

Think of the money as an **investment** against your time, it will help you stay motivated through the harder parts of the learning curve.

* If the course is 48 hours over 12 weeks then $75 might be a good idea
* If you just want a quickie course then take the free option

Here is a longer break down of the edX [online certificates](https://www.theschoolbell.net/online-courses-with-certificates) if you are interested.

The most senior guy on the team who is also my manager doesn’t communicate much with me and often stays till and past midnight to get work done yet never delegates to me.

I know they need me because they wouldn’t have hired me, but it really feels like it I leave there will be a huge burden put on the team.

I have a great salary for my position, 1 year out of college. However, I really am not learning at all nor growing as an individual because most of the company is much older than me and there’s a sit and get your work done type office vibe.

His arguments confronts the claims that U.S. businesses are having a tough time finding and hiring qualified people because of factors like universities inadequately training recent graduates for the workforce.  He responded that such claims are exaggerated because employers, that used to provide training to new employees (especially in entry-level positions), have been cutting training budgets and are expecting new candidates to come in already trained for the tasks specific to their roles.  This was especially common during the recession when there was a surplus of seasoned employees competing for entry-level jobs.


 As a result, these entry-level positions, that used to serve as starting points in a career for recent graduates, now require multiple years of experience.


The author argues that universities training students for specific job roles is incredibly inefficient because of the rapidly changing demands for different skills in the job market:
>One problem with trying to get our educational institutions to produce the students employers want is that there is no guarantee that anyone will hire them when they graduate. Telling young people to major in, say, petroleum engineering, which was among the hottest jobs this decade, turned out to be bad advice when demand fell off. It’s also incredibly inefficient to try to learn work-based skills in a classroom setting.

My manager had come up to me ran by me a couple of questions he has asked me If I I was in school and whether or not I had another job. My answer was no. He offered to give me forty hours, something that a lot of people would be grateful for. He had asked me If I wanted to do the coffee position at my job. I use to work at Mcdonalds and making drinks use to be fun so I thought that this would be a nice opportunity for me. I had agreed to take the position but that I only wanted to work 30 hours, that way I could move up or down in hours depending on how I felt while working the new position. He was upfront and told me that I would only have my trainer for one day and that I would be all on my own from there. I saw that he had put me on the weekend and the trainer said that it gets really crazy with coffee and Im scared for the weekend because I know the servers are going to be frustrated with me because its going to be super busy and I will be slowing everything down for them.

It was my first day working the restaurant side of my job today. Usually I stick to banquets. Throughout the day I had been following my trainer around and one person that I know from banquet said ""cmon guy"" in response to me not knowing the table numbers and not knowing where to drop off the coffee and It was this comment that made me feel awful.

So I just finished my 2nd year as a civil engineer, and haven't gotten a coop work term yet. I applied to about 80 jobs but only got 5 interviews, and no offers. Getting no offers really sucks. It seems like my confidence lowers everytime after an interview. One interview that hit my confidence was an interview with the city of Edmonton. They were looking for 2 students and interviewed 3 people (including me), and I still didnt get the job. It really sucks.


I've been going to my university job office for resume/interview help, but still had no luck. Even before going for help, I realize the biggest weakness I have compared to other students is my lack of work experience (ie. I have no work experience at all). I thought that grades were everything and dint focus on getting any experience. And it's a mistake in my part, and probably should have tried to look for jobs during highschool, but no point in regretting in the past. 


With my lack of work experience, I have been volunteering and joined an engineering club to compensate for the lack of experience. With those, I gained amazing memories, but it still doesnt feel the same as getting a work term. 


I feel like a part of not getting interviews is my interviewing skills. I generally don't have very good experience with talking to people, but I felt that most of my interviews felt really good (only 1 interview felt unprepared). But I guess that wasn't the case since I'm still looking for jobs.

Also since about 90-95% of civil students got a job makes me even more depressed about it.


Being dropped out would kill me inside. I worked so hard during my first year since I needed a higher GPA to apply for coop, but I feel like that was just a waste if I end up being dropped out. In addition, if I don't get a job for my coop, what are the chances that I get a job after I graduate? Thoughts like this scare me. 


At this point, I kinda accepted the fact that I'll be dropped out of coop, but the future terrifies me. I basically don't see a future in what I do right now

4. Is your career center not actively helping you find a coop? Other than providing resume reviews?
5. The art of interviewing is just sounding confident and practicing. You can do this in normal discourse, spend a little bit of time to think before you speak and make sure you articulate well - even on a colloquial basis, this will go far.
6. honestly, see if you can get any presentation opportunities in classes. this will help your interview prep.
7. If your school expects you to find your own co-op how have you been networking with your peers. Can you get a mentor in this co-op program and get help that way?

My workplace consists of 2 different buildings with the same trainings administered by different staff (we'll call them Building A and Building B). When I initially started 16 months ago, I was assigned to split my time between both buildings, and completed all of my initial training at Building A; however, after 5.5 months, I was offered to work full-time at Building B, and have been there since the last 11 months. Overall, my workplace consists of frequently being short staffed due to mismanagement, miscommunication, inadequate trainings, low salary, burnout, etc. I have been searching for another job with a better work atmosphere, but haven't been successful in finding another job yet.

During one of my initial trainings, the training was supposed to taught for 3 full days, but ended up being taught for only 2 days due to a snow day happening that week, and subsequent time constraints at Building A. Despite the ""shortened"" training, I felt fairly well equipped with the presented knowledge, and passed. I was initially supposed to complete my recertification of this training 4 months ago, but due to the backlog of trainings and disorganization of my workplace, they decided to do my recertification just last week, after 4 months past the original ""deadline"". The recertification course is intended to be a 3-4 hour course summarizing all of the training from the initial 3 day course that's taken when you first start with the company.  I completed the recertification at Building B (since I now work there full-time), and have been noted to have several deficiencies, which has significantly caught me off guard, especially since the trainings are supposedly created to provide comparable information at both buildings. It is also noted that this training is not completed by my department supervisor; it is by another coordinator within the workplace.

The overall recertification training was only completed by 1 instructor at Building B (no other instructors agreed to show up to assist with the training, leading to mass confusion about recertification training expectations, improper abilities to fully teach material, etc. When I completed my initial training, it was done with 3 instructors present for additional feedback also, etc). I have never completed a recertification course before, and felt that the instructor heavily criticized me in front of the other trainees, and felt that the training was ultimately a very demeaning, humiliating, and discouraging experience for me, which I did not experience with any of my initial trainings at Building A. I also have not been noted to have any other deficiencies by my supervisor related to my job duties, etc.

Given that I completed all of my initial training at Building A, I am not sure if deficiencies are being noted because the trainings really aren't ""standardized"" like they should be between both buildings and I did not learn everything I initially should have, if it's because my shortened 2 day training really should've been a 3 day training when I initially took it 16 months ago, etc. None of my coworkers  or other colleagues have had a recertification or initial training experience like this. I spoke with my supervisor about this situation because I truly feel like a ""failure"", and she assured me that this is a result of errors and inadequacy by the training department that are beyond my control, and that is not my fault. My supervisor also mentioned that there seems to be ongoing issues of training consistency occurring between both buildings also. I am planning to meet with the instructor (with my supervisor present) to discuss my recertification training performance, as well as my previous training experiences, but am overall still feeling like a failure and really upset about this situation, even with 16 months of experience at my job.

Everything is still a mess...but it's an organized mess. Identify which one you want to do first and then do one pile at a time.

Those piles are the tasks you've identified that need doing. The silverware was tasks that aren't time sensitive and the pots and pans are big items that can be done later.

QA - Software Quality Assurance

So I am an IT person with 2.5 years of IT support work experience. I pursued a career shift to QA because I wanted that ever since before graduating from college. After six months of being jobless and countless interviews, I finally landed on a junior QA role. I was so happy about landing this job...

...until the training session began.

Basically, the purpose and goal of the training is to learn about three company-specific tools, and the endgame was to develop a working system using these tools. I was motivated at first, until the trainer began to inform us that if we fail the training, they'll have to ""let us go"" (it wasn't his intent to scare us in the first place though).

When I heard that, my motivation...became fear. So I had to learn them all by a bit of ""force."" (I was able to learn the use of these tools properly though)

Our training session only has two weeks overall, I am currently at the last week of my training, and we are now developing the system on our own hands. Most programming languages used in these tools aren't thoroughly discussed, and we had to use Google to even begin studying for it. In the first place, developing a system from scratch wasn't my forte, so I experienced so many difficulties coming from here and there, to the point that I am beginning to feel shy asking questions to my teammates.

Not to mention, the training session is still in the process of being improved. There were many VAGUE requirements and data dictionaries. We had to figure out the rest, according to our trainer. The two-week pressure was too much, and we had to resort to overtime just to finish one module from another (this OT is not paid and is not approved as an offset). Heck, we even had to sacrifice our weekends just for this.

The final day of my training will be next week, and I am already anticipating the results. I am particularly slow in developing a system, and I felt like I will fail the training.

Fast forward if I fail the training: I was thinking that I will need to put that company in my resume because they had my government numbers for taxation purposes (in our country, almost all companies required our government numbers). I cannot lie in my resume because it will just make situations worse when applying for other companies. 

So I was thinking: Am I complaining too much? I tried my very best, but everything becomes overwhelming for me. I would feel ashamed of myself if I only lasted in a company for less than a month and got fired because I failed in training.

Again, I would appreciate any advice, suggestion, or insight. I will try my best to respond to your post.

For the past couple of weeks I’ve been at least short/over 3.00 and it’s super frustrating!!! I do everything I’m supposed and I somehow still end up with my cash drawer being out of balance :(

Two months is, I'm trying really hard but when figuring it all out by myself, I might not write as many orders as they hoped. Though at least I brought in some new prospects. However, I heard no feedback so I thought I was doing alright and they would just cut me some slack.

Until last weekend, when i ""accidentally"" used the company credit card because I lost mine (did inform hr immediately!) for personal use, then got an email from hr saying this COULD be reason for determination but then I called her crying and we were alright. I felt like crap for the rest of the week, and in order to prove my thrustwortyness, sending all kinds of emails regarding my whereabouts, thus causing only more miscommunication. Then my manager send me a really pissed off email, saying I was making my own position hardly bearable and had to shut my mouth and SELL. So I freaked out.

To make the shit show complete, 2 days later I had a tiny car accident with a bump AND I couldn't work for three days due something stupid (which had nothing to do with the accident though) and now I'm freaking out in bed thinking what a complete idiot I am and how embarrassing this must be for the one who recommended me, hired me, and my network to whom I bragged about getting this job.

Basically, we built a front end in excel that is coloured up in company colours, and all the buttons on the GUI are hyperlinked to locations in a file directory. Within each linked file are 3-4 resources. 

1. the training module (i.e. excel sheet with data, explanation on what methodology is used to process that data, and calculation checks)

2. a tutorial video (I used OBS studio - it's free and seems to work well)

3. a notepad file that you add your initials to to check off that you've done it and also checked for errors (essentially acting as like a wiki of sorts)

4. any other relevant content

So, we've built this index, and now we're filling it up with content.

We're also going to record presentations from industry leaders and stuff like that to help pass on knowledge from company and industry veterans.

The idea is we're trying to make records of stuff that is known, and knowledge that has taken years to accumulate, then put it in an easily accessible structure, complete with full walkthroughs on how to actually *do* it.

So, we have, for example, field studies, tests, which generate data, so our breakdown (so far) is something like this:

* geotechnical -> subdirectory: analytics/field work/calculations
  


*geochemical -> lab testing/static/kinetic/field testing

*hydrogeology -> field tests/data handling/GW modelling

Etc. so each sub-directory has a new list, and you just keep drilling down until you find what you're looking for.

Hope that helps - eventually we'll replace the excel/VBA GUI with an actual app. ",2019-02-05 16:49:47

I've been unemployed for a few months. I have a good amount of money saved and it wasn't too big a deal. I quit my last job and made a big move across the country, so it was voluntary. Last week, after a while of searching, I received TWO pretty exciting job offers. I waffled between the two jobs for days. Job A was a job in my chosen career path, low stress, okay pay. Job B was slightly different from the path I've been on, medium stress and great pay. After much deliberation, I decided to accept Job B because I thought it might be exciting and to be honest, the pay was enticing. 

Today was my first day. First of all, the job I trained for today is not really the function I was told I'd be hired for. I was offered what I thought was an office position. However, today I shadowed the C.O.O. all day on a job site, being trained as if being on site would be my primary position (using language such as ""you'll be doing this"" and ""when you are in charge of this""). It ended up being an 11 hour day. I wasn't given a restroom break. I didn't have anything to eat or drink all day and even though I thought I was taking a white collar job, I spent much of my day doing labor tasks. Also, I'm a young woman being given a somewhat rowdy crew of men to manage out the door on my first day. 

The person who trained me today texted me just now telling me to come in even earlier tomorrow, almost guaranteeing a 12 hour day and I just don't even want to go. I feel terrible, but I want to just crawl in bed and turn off my phone. I feel like I made the wrong choice and I wish so badly I could go back to the day I turned the other job down and choose the other path.

2454,admdjc,False,Training,2,I keep making mistakes at my new job and am taking a long time to complete my work. How can I take more ownership of my performance?,jobs,"I started a new job in a corporate office about 4 months ago and have been working in my field for 5-10 years (i.e., not a newbie). My first month here was spent training, and, afterward, the person who trained me has been on a sabbatical for the last 3 months (and will continue to be so for another 2 months), so I've basically been on my own since that time.

My team's work is pretty siloed, and each of us work on our own projects without much overlap. In other words, my teammates aren't very familiar with the technical details of what I work on, although there is some overlap with some of our more general job tasks that everybody on the team is responsible for. My boss says that if I have questions on my projects, they would be the most knowledgeable person to go to. 

Onto my problems. I am basically making mistakes in my work, and, so far, I've always been the last person to complete their work amongst my team, sometimes going a few hours over the deadlines. When I started this job, my boss said they are looking for someone who can work independently. I feel like I can work by myself, but it just takes a very long time for me to find the answers when I look independently. I can go to my boss and ask questions to make things go faster, but I feel like lots of my questions would be very basic things that would make my boss ask, ""The information's right there. Why are you asking me what to do?"" I can work independently, but it just takes me a long time to find the relevant information I need. I also don't want to keep bothering my boss with every, little question I have, and I feel like I have a lot.

I'm also naturally a slow learner and need some hand-holding with new tasks (whereas hand-holding seems to be frowned upon these days). There are still a lot of things I don't know about my projects, lots of what I feel are basic things, like how they work in general. I feel like this is because my trainer didn't have time to train me on everything before they left, and my boss often tells me to just look at previous examples to try and recreate what they did. This leaves lots of gaps in my understanding about my projects since, while I can recreate the work, I don't really understand what I'm doing.


I feel like my boss is now starting to lose confidence in me. They continue to accompany to meetings about my projects and has started leaving me reminders about my job tasks on my calendar. (When I started, my boss told me they don't want to be have to remind or keep track of his team's detailed tasks and wants them to take ownership of their own projects.)

My team had most recently completed our most critical time of the year, and I made my boss stay late at night since I was the last person to finish my work, whereas all my teammates had completed their tasks and left for the day hours before I finished my work. I was finally able to complete my projects a few hours after our deadline, whereas the rest of my team was able to meet theirs.

My work quality was also not good since I was rushing to complete my work, and, sure enough, the next day, another team pointed out errors in my work, ones that I've made before. Once I have a chance to review my work in more detail, I expect to find more errors. My boss did not seem upset at me when the other team pointed out my mistakes, but I think they were starting to get a little irritated.

Many of them are nervous about employee hires in general because on the business end it is a huge investment of resources and time.

I've been at my current company for about 2.5 years.  When I was first hired on, it was so I could help the then project manager expand this new business line.  Long story short, that manager ended up being very hands off, and I ended up being responsible for leading the team, handling meetings with client, facilitating the manager's meetings, and doing the actual technical work.  The PM was fired and replaced, team shuffled, and throughout all of this, the company owner made it a point to tell me how he appreciated what I was doing, and that he saw me evolving into a partner at the company.   

Around this time last year I had to move departments to fill in a vacant position, and everything shifted at this point.  I got little to no interaction with the company owner or other managers, and when we did interact the dynamic changed.  Managers now talk to me like I'm an entry level employee without the benefit of anyone checking in on my status or progress.  I've tried to be patient over the last year and learn more in my new position, but nothing seems to be changing and I'm starting to feel like I'm needed to fill this role, but I'm not a valued member of the team anymore.

I was with my previous team for two years and I was a \~rock star\~ over there. I knew how everyone worked and was able to manage my six executives and team of \~70 on my own, which really impressed my new executive in my interview. I was hired with this team almost 3 weeks ago, and I feel like I've been *so slow* since my first day.

Granted, I haven't received any form of training with this team. I was basically thrown in to it from day one, and I feel like I'm learning how my new executive works by her telling me I'm making a mistake or doing things wrong. I'm really struggling with this learning curve, because her working style is a complete 180 from what I'm used to with my previous team, and I almost feel like I'm starting from scratch or having to rewire my brain and unlearn what I'm used to. I also feel like an idiot because I'm having my mistakes pointed out to me constantly. I was told that I was hired because they knew I was a great admin and that I could handle it, but I feel really discouraged after having mistake after mistake pointed out (which is really just preferential stuff of my current exec vs. my previous ones). 

My previous execs would essentially give me a long list of things to do, and then leave me alone to do them + answer their phones. My new exec is *extremely* hands on, requires a lot more ""assisting"", remembers exact conversations and things she asked you to do from two weeks ago, and likes everything to be a certain way. She will ask me questions about her calendar or meetings I've scheduled as if I have her calendar memorized, expecting a quick answer, and then I feel like a flustered idiot trying to remember what her meetings are or when I scheduled a specific meeting for.

She's SO nice and everyone tells me she's a great leader, but I can't help but feel like I'm falling short of their expectations of this ""master admin"" they hired. I think she's used to a level of service that her previous admin provided (who was with her for a few years) and I'm just not there yet.

Im a long time lurker and for months i have been picking up some of your advice, so thank you for all you that contribute to this sub. I have fortunately always been employed but recently after being redundant, I have job hopped a few times and got stuck in companies that don't push me, nor pay me adequately for my skills. I work in a county that is full of smaller companies that don't appreciate IT security and infrastructure and all the big players are moving out as its cheaper to set up elsewhere. Well after months of searching, 100's of applications and 10+ interviews I finally found a company who was willing to pay me the going rate. 

I initially got offered the job but 10% under the advertised salary with promise of getting that 10% after 12 months. However I retorted that for the job they require me to do, what they are offering well under the going rate for someone in that position elsewhere. I advised the recruiter of some sources that prove this (itjobswatch, etc). I also had an advantage of knowing that they have been without that role for over 4 months and there IT was in a bad state so I knew I could play hard ball. 

Anyway they rejected my counter-offer last Friday so I rejected their offer entirely. However today I got called by the recruiter saying they are desperate for someone like me and the MD has agreed to my counter-offer plus certification training. So happy days!

So apart from sharing this with you and hopefully giving you some hope that this can be done, I will share some of my experiences:

-For those of you that have a job already, be prepared to be comfortable for as long as it takes in that role until you find one you really like.

-Don't always go for the first offer you get, weigh up the benefits, travel, extra costs, also the feeling you get from other employees when you walk around

- Be patient, some weeks I sent 5 - 10 applications and got 0 back and other weeks I sent 1 and got a callback. 

- Don't sell your self short, do some research of what others doing your role are getting paid and use that to leverage 

- Go in with 'nothing to lose' and be confident. Remember they NEED YOU, so put your big boy pants on, research the role, apply that to your current skills

- Turn the interview into a conversation, ask questions and don't be afraid to interrupt when appropriate when they are asking you questions. Try and relate these questions to what you are being asked so conversation flows smoothly.

- Do not rehearse answers to questions, get some facts about the company and research the role and memorise them but don't memorise them in structured sentences as it comes of non-genuine.

- It's OK to pass on questions you don't know - just be honest

- For some of you this is hard because you've been out searching for so long but be positive, show you are enthusiastic even if you have to 'fake it to make it'.

That's where my concern comes in. The owner has told me that he absolutely wants to keep me on after the contract ends. However, I was able to take a look at my predecessors last pay stub (after reaching out to her beforehand, of course), and realized that she was getting paid a significantly less amount than I was expecting to get, which was really disheartening.

To be fair, from what I was told, she was very much a bare minimum person: punch in on time, out on time, no initiative (coming from other workers. not the owner).

It's not tactics. They are trying to see if you are affordable. They want to NOT insult you with a low offer. HR doesn't give a crap what you make. Their job is to make sure the hiring manager offers something reasonable. 

If you want $170,000 and the job pays $80,000? They're going to look for other positions and opportunities for you.

I have TWICE this week gone to bat for people who made less than I thought they should in their current position and both have offers out for at least 20% raises from where they are (both not internal candidates.... they were both shocked... but I looked at what the market pays them and got them to a reasonable level for their skill set) One of them is getting an offer $30K OVER what the hiring manager wanted to offer.

Why? Because the Hiring manager has no idea how much this person SHOULD make and neither does the person who applied - who is grossly underpaid at their current position. (I thought she was going to cry when I told her the offer today)

Y'all think HR is the enemy. It's not an ""us VS them"" game. We are both pulling on the same side of the rope. You want a job. I want to give you a job. The hiring manager is the PITA who is in the way.

I'm a clinical histotech with a BA, I'm the field for three years. Due to the work environment, unhappiness, and no prospect of moving up, I've been looking for jobs. My undergrad was in a hard science with a focus on research and I'd like to go back to that in preparation for grad school. 


I just interviewed for a position as a histotech in a research lab and I think I will get it. The only snag is the pay - which I understand. Research labs can't afford to pay as much for a Histotechnologist as a clinical lab can. After three years (Union too), I've worked up to a salary of 60K. Keeping in mind my long term goals, I expressed a range of 45  to 60 K, to encapsulate what I'm currently earning; I think I can go as low as 43,000 though. The job was posted as 30,000 plus DOE. They've been having a hard time getting qualified candidates with a histology background to apply for this position.


The PI said my range was too high and I'd really have to think about if moving to a research job will give me the benefits that I'm looking for (research experience, publications, growth). I understand this, which is why I'm not just looking for jobs in clinical histology or processing labs. 

However, according to the PI, my job isn't just a research assistant. I would be 'fulfilling an important role in preparing tissue for the other lab members who don't have time to cut their own tissue'. In this case, my technical skills are very important. 


I'm also worried that if I accept an offer that they still feel is too high, that I won't have job security. At first, I would be filling in for a research histotech on maternity leave and they're not sure if she's coming back. I would also no longer be in a union. I think they could easily let me go if my salary is a strain on finances.


I feel that, despite the benefits, 30,000 would be exploitative for my histology skills. What are your thoughts on how I should proceed?

I have no idea how much I should be asking for, and was able to stall with ""I have done a fair bit of market research into the pay range of those with similar titles and responsibilities and have decided on a range that I would be comfortable with.

2481,3nllcb,False,Experience,145,How I broke out of retail & got a 6 figure salary in 3 years,jobs,"This is a personal story.  Some details have changed or kept vague to protect my identity since I work for a ""high profile"" position now.

---

First, my humblebrag: I make over $100k per year working about 20-25 hours per week for a multinational corporation in the Midwest US.  I'm officially a ""business analyst.""  In reality, I look at Outlook and Excel for 10 hours per week and B.S. the rest.

Three years ago, I worked 40 hours a week on my feet doing retail customer service B.S. at a local grocery chain.  I made $10 per hour.  I have a liberal arts degree.

Here's what helped me make the transition (in order of importance).

**1\. Learn new skills on my own time**.  When I decided that I had enough of retail, I went to the library and picked up books on different office skills.  Excel, accounting, finance, project management, basic programming, and business leadership.  For me, these were the topics that stuck.  I came home every damn night and read and practiced everything.  I continued to do this even after my first office job.

**2\. Be a job hopper**.  I found job hopping opened many more opportunities.  Yes, some people will thumb their nose at your resume, but it's necessary to advance.  I've had 5 jobs in the past 3 years (not counting the retail one).  Contract positions were great because it taught a lot.

**3\. Keep in contact with old coworkers (aka networking)**. This didn't help me get my first job, but it did help me land my current gig.

**4\. Find the path of least resistance.**  Opportunities just came up organically that I was not interested in.  I would normally not be interested in programming, but a software development position came up in my company and my boss asked me if I was interested.  No, I wasn't, but I studied my ass off and took it anyway since it was a move up.  I'm not a developer now, but I have used a lot of those skills in my current job to get some street cred with the IT/tech department.

**5\. Be willing to stay late for a big project.**  My father gave me advice once that said: be the first one in the office and the last one to leave.  This advice is old hat.  Here's my version.  Stay late for a big project ONCE, then come in late and leave early afterwards.  Once you get the reputation of the one who got that big project done, you never have to worry about being on time to work again.  You get a lot of cred with leadership who don't give a crap about what time you came in today.

**6\. Keep a good relationship with a GOOD third-party recruiter.**  Third party recruiters are a dime a dozen.  And there are some shady ones out there.  But if you find a good one, they are really valuable.  Found 2 jobs through one.

Here's been my career path:

First job: admin assistant (aka secretary) for around $25k/yr

Second job: financial analyst - looked at spreadsheets for around $40k/yr

Third job: junior software developer - built some stupid internal websites around $50k/yr (only job where I moved within the same company)

Fourth job: project manager - a much better paying admin assistant around $80k/yr

Fifth job: business analyst for around $110k/yr",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3nllcb/how_i_broke_out_of_retail_got_a_6_figure_salary/,254,"The problem with a post like this is that you are setting someone up to get caught, denied a job or at the worst, fired after they got the job from lying.

I interviewed at a sports media company last year over the phone and the interviewer wanted to bring me in to test my CSS skills as I had listed it on my resume. Did I use CSS in my everyday? Yes, but not to the extent they wanted me to do so. Luckily I didn't have to do any hand coding, just observation and telling him what I saw. It didn't cost me the job as HR ultimately canceled the position, but I came away with a very important lesson.

The advice you listed can be found on any Business Insider/Forbes careers related article and it isn't necessarily good advice especially #5. If anyone is just starting their career post-college, DO NOT follow what he said.

I've worked with people like you so that's why it bothers me that you're advising others to follow your lead.

2482,3ub6lq,False,Experience,24,How to know your about to be fired in the IT world.,jobs,"## NOTE## Don't think of this as a bible here, more or less this is from my perspective and experience. ####

One thing that is great about IT is it's fairly easy to know when you're about to be shown the door, this often gives you weeks in advance to prepare for it and get as many resumes out into the internet as possible before the axe comes down.

One of the primary reasons for firing is the company owner is more often than not clueless about tech, and often will think of IT as a utility (sort of like an expensive electric bill) combine ignorance with bottom-line level thinking your job in IT is always hanging on by a thread; so the owner might not care you spent all weekend rolling out a dozen VM's or installing VPN's all throughout the state, and this is fine as it's also your job to educate them on that necessity, but still never be shocked when your time is up and more often than not it can be up fairly quickly. With this in mind I'll offer you some very common scenarios that foreshadow your tech demise:

1. You get a PIP

Generally this has nothing to do with your ability, more often than not this occurs due to the hours you work, how tidy your desk is, how often you travel between locations and inter-department communication; you might think these are minor things but since the owner probably doesn't understand everything you do on a day-to-day basis they tend to gauge your performance on triviality and something as simple as leaving too many Linux books on your desk can warrant a negative review. 

The first sign of trouble is the owner now wants you to consult with them on everything you do, be it how you send out emails, to where you are at all times, you begin to feel the sting of micromanagement as everything you say and every location you visit is now logged (and yes that office manager in that remote office WILL report that you got there at 11:15 as opposed to 11:00 when you said you would be there because your owner asked them to) so expect a litany of these issues on your outboarding papers.

2. Your suggestions are more easily dismissed

Remember when you first got there and the owner listened to your suggestion about purchasing a NSA2600 and a couple TZ400's to get the locations standardized and it was a done deal? But now the owner puts simple things on the backburner or you can't push much needed updates as easily and or they require excessive documentation (we'll get to this later) and approval? 

The sign here is that the owner while they still have confidence in your ability to do your job, they don't want to make costly purchases if they know you'll be out the door in two-weeks, and if this device arrives and your no longer there then it just sits in a storage closet and wastes money... No one wants to spend money on equipment if there are no operators for that equipment. 

If you notice the owner seemingly giving you the slight on recommendations that would've been a no-brainer three months ago, it's probably time to start looking on job boards.

3. Documentation Frenzy

Documentation is key to order for any organization, any good IT Manager knows this and should be updating all documentation pretty regularly; however if the owner out of the blue starts requesting a bunch of documentation such as tutorials on how you encrypt laptops or step-by-step processes on how to backup the systems then it's safe to assume that there is doom on your horizon.

Look owners hire you to do this stuff for them, documentation serves them ZERO purpose as it would serve you and your subordinates, the goal of getting all this documentation upfront and right now is so when you are shown the door the next guy to sit in your seat doesn't have to metaphorically re-invent the wheel that would slow business processes down.

If your owner asks for this, you're probably in trouble.

4. The Consultants

Every now and then the owner might bring in a consultant to help with certain IT functions that might overwhelm you such as setting up SQL databases and or some programming that is time-intensive, there is no problem with this but do understand a consultant is a double edged sword.

Consultants can't make any money unless there is a ""problem"" that needs to be solved, and often times that problem becomes you, the consultant will often tell the owner about how cheap his services are in comparison to your salary, he might bring up words like ""best practices"" and begin to cast doubt on your ability to do your job. 

Something as simple as ""the passwords aren't strong enough"" or ""The VM's aren't best practice"" is enough to cause reasonable doubt, even if under your watch there has been ZERO security risks and 99.99% up-time the consultant doesn't NEED to prove he or she is better, they just need to plant the idea in your superior's heads that A) you're expensive and B) your becoming a liability

If a consultant is hanging around longer than what would be expected for project completion, rest assured that he is whispering sweet nothings into the owners ears about how his company can do SLA's at a 30% discount; since businesses are bottom-line this is poisonous to your career.

5. The passwords, and the end of you.

Every now and then the owner might want a password or two for a few systems, this is pretty normal as a owner might want to see all the folders on your shared drive and a domain admin account makes sense for that. 

But if you come in one Monday morning and suddenly the owner wants the passwords for everything, the Wi-Fi, the anti-virus, the VSphere, the help-desk and anything and everything in between, then rest assure that you'll be boxing everything up by the end of the day.

The moment you start handing over passwords is the moment a hired consultant is on the other end changing them as fast as they get them, and within the hour you can count on your administrator credentials being nuked from the system and you can't login to anything... Feel free to take extra-long on that lunchbreak because the moment you return you'll be greeted by a powered off computer and a HR rep asking for your keys.

So what now?

The good news if you see the signs you can better prepare, and don't dwell on it too much. IT is a large field with a lot of demand and supply it isn't uncommon at all for entire IT departments to be swapped in and out year-to-year, you have a blessing of working in a high-availability career.

I just wanted to stop by to vent and share my experience.  I have been on the job hunt for about 10 months; 4 months unemployed and VERY actively interviewing, testing, and (as the title implies) getting rejected. 


I just finished the process of interviewing for a position supporting the Superintendent and Board of Trustees of a small, public school district.  Long story short, it was down to me and one other candidate.  I ""knocked [the first interview] way out of the park"" and met with the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent on Monday.  I just got a phone call from the Superintendent himself and I was told the following: 


* You didn't get the job, but I'm calling because you did very, very well in the process.

* You have incredible potential and your references/qualifications speak to that.


* There's nothing else you could've done; I don't want you to think that you could've done x, y, z or done anything differently. 


* You're at a great point in your career; there was nothing else you could've done. 


* It was a matter of circumstance. 


* We have some openings in the Spring and we really want you to keep us in mind.  We will probably be reaching out to you before you reach out to us. 


I've been in similar positions (i.e. getting to the last round and getting beaten out) probably about a dozen times in the past couple of months and I'm so **very** tired of hearing ""you have incredible potential *BUT* we went with another candidate.""  


I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe just an outlet to express my exasperation with this process.  But here I am.  I really have done everything I can to prepare myself for each interview; I just (stupidly) let myself get really invested in the idea of this particular position.  Has anyone else felt this way?

I'm so tired of constant rejection and (fake?) validation at the same time.  I can't help but feel defeated each time this happens.  I'm overall a more bitter, jaded person because of this experience.

**My story:**

I've been mega-commuting for three years. Two hours each way, on a small, jerky company shuttle (I experience some degree of motion sickness 95% of the time). I live in a major city, and my job is located 50 miles away.

The reason I do this is because I love living in the city. The people I care about live here (girlfriend, family, friends). I rent my own nice place for a great price. I explore the city a lot. And, I don't need a car and don't own one; I can use public transit or use a Zipcar if I need to get around.

However...after taking time off recently for the holidays and only having to commute from my bed to the kitchen—Jesus, it finally dawned on me how devastating my commute has been. I finally realize, and feel, the years of cumulative strain on my psychological and physical well-being. I've endured the discomfort, telling myself that I'm just paying my dues; after three years, I'm certain it's time to move on and find a job that'll only take me a 30-min bus ride.

I told the agency woman im interested in the job and what she said about it and told her if she can send my CV that will be great. So she sends the CV and tells me they guy would like to do a phone interview. I tell her thats fine and i will take 15 mins break next day to have the call in a local Costa coffee shop near my work place and it gets set up for next day 9.15am.

My former classmate, let's call her Julie, had her first phone interview about a month ago, it went well, she got to the next round which was the office interview, but didn't get the job due to lack of experience. (By the way, don't you just love this ""no job - no experience - no job"" vicious cycle?)


Julie told me she was prepared, read about the company, thought the possible questions through, so she was pretty much relaxed when the phone rang.


Now we know that the call went well, but **Julie made some mistakes**:


1) During the interview she was lying on a couch in her pajamas, that's why her voice was too relaxed and later during the office interview the employer said she didn't sound ""really motivated to get the job"".


2) She didn't turn off the Facebook notifications on her phone so during the talk she was distracted by the message sounds a couple times. Also someone tried to call her on Skype.


3) The other thing Julie regretted was that she didn't have all the needed documents handy. When the employer asked if she had any questions about the company, she remembered she had some, but had put aside her notebook and forgot what it was.


So **Julie helped me realize this**:

1) I better wear something formal and sit straight so that my voice sounds interested and serious, not demotivated.

2) I should eliminate all the distractions

3) My resume, my notes and company info should be somewhere near when I get the call.


Another friend of mine Mike said he got a call from a company when he was walking home. The interviewer asked if he was available to talk at that moment and he said 'yes'. Mike later regretted it because half way through the interview he got nervous and couldn't answer the questions properly. So his advice to me was **never agree to have an unscheduled phone interview**. Apologize, say that you're busy and schedule for later. That way you'll get an opportunity to prepare.

For some reason this makes me even more nervous since I don't know if I'll be able to have multiple takes, I would imagine I won't be able to. Any info or experiences with this would be appreciated.

2489,46g8bz,False,Experience,6,UPDATE: Boss wants me to hide that I quit,jobs,"My boss called me (she has been in contact with me at least everyday since I quit, which is new since we'd go weeks without contact whilst working for her) and told me that I am not allowed to mention my job on social media. She said that someone flagged up a post to her in which I said I was unhappy with my job and that things hadn't been going well and I was stressed, which she said was both embarrassing to the company and to myself (even though the company or specifics were never mentioned). She has said she is doing me a favor by asking me to remove this as a future employer would look down on this. 

I will be speaking to her supervisor tomorrow, but she keeps saying my contract came to a ""natural end,"" which is strange to me because I quit. She has emphasized that I don't say anything bad about her or the job once it is done, however, once my notice period is up, I am confused over what she can even do....and at this point since I'm within my notice period, I am still confused as to what she can do to me for vaguely mentioning my unhappiness on social media. 

Can't wait to be rid of this job.

My job and its shitty salary couldn't sustain me anymore. I was about to get kicked out. Then I had an idea. I live in an apartment or I used to anyway, and they have a huge garage. Parking spots cost $45 a month. I spoke to management and they told me that it won't happen. So I went to another apartment and asked them. I said I'll pay you the $45 a month for a spot but instead of a car I'm going to set up a little section for myself. Well, holy shit he said yes. I put up a makeshift wall so that no one will be disturbed by my presence, I'm only there at night really so the people aren't active while I'm there and I still have my shit job but now who gives a damn, my rent is $45. 

Remember folks, we live in a democratic society, lol not really it's an oligarchy but the important thing to remember is, society doesn't have to dictate how you find your happiness. I don't work hard at my job, at all. Hard work doesn't pay off if you don't mind living in a garage.

2492,3zr3y9,False,Experience,0,Best Job Boards to Find Niche Talent,jobs,"Everyone knows the job boards like Craigslist, Indeed, and Monster, but there are over 100 different other job boards that specialize in various niche industries.

As someone applying to jobs, this can be great because you can find a much more targeted list of opportunities based on your career desires.

Also, as a business owner, they can be a great resource to find a targeted interested pool of candidates for a low cost.

A few examples I've come across:

* Creative: [TalentZoo](http://www.talentzoo.com/), [Art Jobs](http://artjobs.artsearch.us/)
* Media: [MediaBistro](http://www.mediabistro.com/)
* Startups: [Angelist](https://angel.co/)
* Nonprofit: [Idealist.org](http://www.idealist.org/)
* Technology: [Dice](http://www.dice.com/), [Stack Overflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/)
* Legal: [LawJobs](http://lawjobs.com/)
* Restaurant/Hospitality: [Culintro](http://culintro.com/), [PoachedJob](http://poachedjobs.com/choose)
* Finance: [eFinancialCareers](http://www.efinancialcareers.com/)
* Government: [USAJobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/)
* Internships: [Internships.com](http://www.internships.com/)
* Sales: [SalesGravy.com](http://www.salesgravy.com/)
* Healthcare: [CareerVitals](http://www.careervitals.com/)
* Constructions: [RigZone](http://www.rigzone.com/)
* Retail: [WorkInRetail](http://www.workinretail.com/)

Sometimes it takes looking beyond the first page of Google search results to find these boards, but they are a great resource for job seekers and people hiring.

As an employer, you can also use sites like [Proven](http://www.proven.com) and [ZipRecruiter](http://www.ziprecruiter.com) to post automatically to a lot of these niche jobs as well as the big dogs like Craigslist and Indeed.

Anyone else have a good experience with a niche job board? Some of the intern ones have worked great for me in the past.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3zr3y9/best_job_boards_to_find_niche_talent/,2,,2016-01-06 18:32:05
