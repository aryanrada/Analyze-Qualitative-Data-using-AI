>*When it comes to skyscrapers and bridges and power plants and elevators and the like, engineering has been, and will continue to be, managed partly by professional standards, and partly by regulation around the expertise and duties of engineers.

&#x200B;

The other day, I was browsing Reddit and I stumbled upon yet another echo-chamber of deluded people who were encouraging these so called **S*****oftware Engineering boot camps***: ""*become a Software Engineer in* ***three months***!"" I kid you not when I say that the comments were along the lines of ""I got bored one summer so I took a three month course and I am now a software engineer!"".

Excuse me? Are we a joke to these people? Most importantly, have the companies that are allowing them to be hired under the title of ""engineer"" gone mad? (hint hint: it's so much cheaper to pretend programmers are engineers, pay them way less, make them feel important and allow the release of buggy, faulty software that one day might actually result in disaster - because to these people, software engineering = programming!).

In some countries, the title engineer is, for some arcane reason, not (as) protected (as it should be), meaning anyone can legally (find a way to) call themselves an engineer. Engineering is a serious profession and requires years of carefully regulated formal education to acquire the theoretical background and tools to support the practical applications of said theory.

It seems as if an alarmingly large amount of people believe that Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Software Development and Programming are all *synonyms*.

**They are not**. You **cannot** ""boot camp"" your way to becoming an engineer in the span of three months (and so many of these boot camps **do** exist, just google them) just as you cannot boot camp yourself to becoming a psychologist, a mathematician or a physicist. You can learn anatomy, you can learn to solve equations, but that is just a *tiny* portion of each profession. I feel like the same must be said about software engineering.

Engineers are supposed to have knowledge in Mathematics and Science, amongst many other things, enough so to apply them in the designing and manufacturing of systems and in effectively solving a problem.

**Please** stop calling yourselves engineers when all you have are 12 weeks of training in programming languages. Software Engineers are so much more than that! Understanding to its core how a computer functions or how neural networks are structured, applying differential equations to solving mechanical movements in robotic arms, designing a quantum computer system capable of running trillions of calculations in the blink of an eye without crashing or drawing too much power to black out an entire city. These are just examples of the many things engineers can do, given adequate time to **adapt** to each scenario.

**We do not work our butts off to learn how to program the ""Add Friend"" button on Facebook or the ""Order Now"" button on Amazon.** Sure, we can do that and a numerous amount of Software Engineers choose software development as their career path, which is wonderful and diverse, but the difference is in the **method**, the **attention to technical detail**, the management of resources. The difference is in the fact that **an engineer has the background to adapt** to changes, any changes. We don't simply code what we're told to code and go home. We take a problem, dissect it, figure out the most efficient, safe and practical approach, and structure a proper testing of said approach.

The Software industry is turning into a mess, where standardized approaches and international standards are thrown out the window. Do you see many buildings, bridges or satellites spontaneously crumbling or blowing up? Maybe a few here and there, but they are by and large well built, solid works of engineering. Notice how many websites, databases, and applications, save for a few lucky cases where true professionals are involved, are constantly broken, sloppily designed pieces of copy-paste code put together with duct tape.

Now, I understand that *civil* engineering, to make an example, requires more regulation due to safety reasons, but let's not forget the implications a poorly designed system can have on a rocket going to Mars, or in a centralized home automation system that can ultimately result in catastrophic failures and the loss of lives.

Software and Computer Engineering should be treated with the same respect any Engineering field merits. Software Development is a practice that Software Engineers should be capable of doing with excellent skill, but is in no way the only thing we do. When I see amateur programmers being given the title of engineer in companies, I die a little inside.

Ultimately, I believe the problem stems from the fact that in this oh-so-young profession, there is so much money to be made in developing websites for large companies that many engineers have shifted their focus towards this market. Just look at how much money FAANG companies are willing to throw at you. It has been forgotten that engineers do so much more than just basic Software Development.

Given that society is rapidly approaching a future where software governs our lives, I believe firmer regulations must be extended to all fields of engineering, including software. After all, automated-driving is a rapidly approaching reality and Tesla is already the top seller in many places. What would happen if these purported ""boot-camped"" engineers laid hands on the core self-driving software that ultimately decides the fate of so many lives? Let us never find out.  


EDIT 1: I will further emphasize this as I do hope nobody misinterprets me - I am in no way elitist and saying that formal education must be a requirement to do anything. That would be silly. There are infinite ways people can learn things and not everyone has access to the very fortunate avenue of University, for which I am eternally grateful. A certification from three months of summer camp is not enough, however.

I used to wonder if I'd ever reach that point. Here is some advice for any one just starting after I've been in it for some time.

&#x200B;

1. Your first job might not be the best fit, but is necessary to get your career off the ground. Don't be afraid to take a job that is not glamorous. Many people move on from their first job. Soak in as much as you can and get a feel for what you would want out of your engineering career.
2. Most engineering jobs have a reasonable pay attached to them and you may have some extra scratch laying around. Figure out how you want to manage your money early. Try to live within your means even though it might feel like you have gone up a tax bracket. Don't get too deep into vices.
3. Engineering can be a very fulfilling career, but not all aspects of engineering is glamorous work. You will have days that are just another day at the office, and have days you might not be doing any engineering at all. This is the reality they don't tell you in engineering school.
4. If you feel overwhelmed, that's okay. That happens to everyone at some point. Just stick with it, figure out your deficits, adapt, and improve. Skills like time management, negotiation, and so on are valuable and this may be the first time you've had a job where you have had to do these things. 
5. If your boss says you're doing well at your job, you're doing well at your job. 
6. There are jerks and dummies at every job, in every line of work. People will try and challenge you. Some people will try and pull you down. Figure out if you want to stay in that environment. Try not to let it get to you.
7. You may find out you want to be in a part of the business that does not have a lot of raw engineering in it. That's okay. 
8. Treat everyone with respect and don't say anything you might regret in the future. The world is small. You may not see this now, but as you go on in your career, an act of good will may help a lot in the future. 
9. Regardless of where you are or where you've came from, you're still fresh and you might not have credibility with your engineering ideas just yet. Just do a good job and you will gain that rapport with people.
10. Stick your neck out where it matters, but don't burn the candle at both ends. Burnout can happen quickly when you see all these people on social media doing everything in the world and you're just making paperclips. You'll find a place where your voice matters and you can make waves. Don't rush to do this so early. 
11. Be mindful with your mental health. Find a hobby that tickles whatever itch you don't get at your day job that you are looking to get in to. Want to do more design? Start making things. Get in to your local business circle. Read. Go hiking. These are all healthy. 
12. Don't spend too much money on beer. Seriously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/d0zbz4/advice_for_new_engineers_from_a_guy_whos_been_in/,1160,"I work and I will be spending so much of my money on that fucking beer.

I love teaching and sharing, and he had limited experience in my field (welding) so I was excited to introduce him to what I feel is some pretty cool stuff. 

I prepared a great project, that would challenge him, keep him engaged, allow him to do some work with his hands, and gather relevant data for our organization. I also put together some training materials to teach him about our welding and testing processes.

All I asked was that he get in at 7 since our lab mostly runs from 6-2:30 and I couldn’t leave him alone in the lab. 

He showed up every day at 9, took 2 hour lunches, and left at 2. No matter how many times I, or my boss, or anybody talked to him about getting here, his actions never changed. 

He blew off any attempt I made to teach him about what’s going on, and now he has to give a presentation to our upper management, mostly clueless, which reflects poorly on me. 

When he was here, he was mostly on his phone on Instagram. All told he completed about 10% of his total project. 

What he did do was attend every single intern fun event or plant tour that was offered by our company, of which there are usually 2 or so a week.

219,ef3xeg,False,None,81,An engineers view on Christmas,engineering,"There are approximately 2 billion children (persons under age 14) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan ) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 19% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each.

Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that, for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stocking, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house. 

Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks.

This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second -- 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour.

The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousands tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the ""flying"" reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them -- Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch).

600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip.

Not that it matters, however; since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo . Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now.

242,7ors1r,False,None,101,"Professional Tip: will you be looking for a new job in the future (hint: you always should)? Take a day every six months to review the latest job descriptions and see what the industry is looking for. Identify gaps, which will become your professional development goals in the next six months.",engineering,"NOTE:  This is my non-profit's reddit account, and the opinions expressed by the writer (Alex) are his own.  However, he is a pretty smart guy and you would be wise to listen.  END NOTE.

Indeed.com is a good source of Job Descriptions (JD's), and SimplyHired is an aggregator of multiple job posting sites.  Cybercoders are highly suspect, and their JD's might not actually be real.  Do your own research there.

I had incredible foresight when I was an undergraduate and would do a JD audit every six months or so.  My foresight was due in large part to my ABET mandated Industrial Advisory Board.  IF you have a IAB, you should consult them when they come for their annual visit.  Their advice is far more grounded than the professors, in general.  By doing this audit, I was able to focus my studies and side projects so I was ready for these new jobs.  I would also use the trends I would see to help identify if a new technology was the ""next big thing.""

Specifically, I saw that microcontrollers were going to be everywhere.  Further, I saw that ARM was going to take over the industry.  Platforms that use ARM such as the STM32F series became a focus for me during my undergraduate years.  I would choose my school/personal/side projects wisely so there was a good reason to use the latest technology.  This was considerably more challenging work, but was far more realistic than any of the normal classwork.

My professors did not like my lack of focus in their classes, but I would find jobs within 6 weeks rather than 6 months like my colleagues (this was just after the housing crisis).  This exercise caused me to go against the grain at my college since I would do the bare minimum to maintain a 3.0+ GPA.  

I am surprised by how few people actually do this audit, but I do it even while I am employed.  It helps me identify if my organization is lacking a core competency, which I will either fill myself or hire to be filled.  This audit also helps me stay current with the industry, just in case I need to bounce.  Using this method, I went from 64k per annum to about six figures per annum in 5 years.  If I were to do anything different, I would have consulted salary.com to aid my negotiations early on.

**Begin Rant:**
Now that I am on the other side of the desk during job interviews, I always eye a 4.0 GPA with some suspicion because we engineers are here to be 'good enough.'  Over engineering a parameter beyond its requirements, such as GPA, is poor engineering, but that is just my opinion.  What I do want to see is a TON of personal and professional projects in your spare time.

I hope this advice is helpful to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/7ors1r/professional_tip_will_you_be_looking_for_a_new/,777,"As someone who is about to graduate in May this is really helpful!! Thank you

I recently was awarded the ""Forbes 30 under 30 in Manufacturing and Industry"", I just turned 22 and have been programming machines/robots since around 14 years old. Thanks to certifications, I was able to join Boeing as what my Manager called their youngest robotics programmer at 19 years old (at least for their R&D Division.) My job title is now “Robotics Programmer” my primary focus is composite carbon fiber: utilizing machines called “Automated Fiber Placement”. All thanks to certifications!
 
I have a massive stockpile of links, and I thought that they would come in handy to others. It goes from Tool Engineer, Robotics, AI, Deep learning, Stress / Design Engineering softwares, PE, LEAN Six Sigma all the way to Programming in Python, CNC and more. 

Some may be faulty over time, feel welcome to update in the comments and I can update the thread 
 
If this is helpful to people, I will spend some more time and put updated prices on each item + format it by grouping related items.

Subsections of ISO60601 state the necessary design and manufacture criteria for respirators, I don't know what they are, it's not my area. You will need your design and manufacturing processes accredited by an independent body (in the UK, it's the MHRA). Your quality management system will need to be ISO13485.

(I recommend MMC specifically because of the large catalog and amazing site).

Just searching terms like ""valves"", ""hinges"", or ""bolts"" has given me so many options to click through. When you see a part you've never heard of, a quick Google search can get you up to speed.

This process is how I learned about countless parts that I can use in future designs that are not necessarily covered in classes. I didn't know about things like lag bolts, solenoid valves, vented screws (for vacuum), ball screws until I just started exploring.

Having a better idea of all the different components out there, even at a very general level, really opens up your ability to be creative and effective in your designs. Plus, it's fun if you're an engineering nerd.

Air is too elastic to flow in that fashion, the high pressure areas mix into the low and diffuse and even out, whereas in a liquid the lack of compression-diffusion elasticity causes the turbulance to stay constant as it does in this video.

Perhaps it was developed on top of a fluid library and it lacks the graphics to illustrate elasticity of air.

Hey smart, useful people!

My name is Katie. I'm a 22 year old university graduate, artist, musician, photographer, activist, nature lover...and quadriplegic. Before my accident, I lived for getting out in nature. It was my favourite thing in the world. I miss it.

And you know what's strange? One of the things i miss most is just being able to get on the ground. Just being able to feel it beneath me...

The challenge: Find a way I can safely get into and out of my chair from the floor

I am paralysed from the chest down, have no core muscles (zilch) and am not particularly strong... Easy right?

Go!

FURTHER INFO!

Man, you lot are amazing!

Some more info to answer some of your questions!

\- I'm a c7 quadriplegic. If I was a lower level injury i would simply be able to do a floor-to-chair transfer and lift myself back in my chair. My lack of core, strength and high tone in my legs make this impossible, at least for the forseable future

\- The ideal would be something I can set up and use entirely on my own as its the independence and spontaneity of this i really miss. Being able to just get out and 'be' alone in nature was my escape.

Currently I rely on my boyfriend to literally just tip me out of my chair and get me back in using the 'scoop method' (same thing in reverse) which most of us sci people are taught in rehab (but that takes a bit of strength on the behalf of my helper and often more than one person if not strong enough)

[How I can currently get out with the help of my boyfriend!](https://reddit.com/link/fig8az/video/vxx3s2i4qnm41/player)

\- If I could somehow find a way of throwing a rope round a tree branch (a problem) I \*might be able to pull myself up in my chair

\-I currently live in the UK (in the midlands)

\- I don't have anyone with the expertise to build anything complex so unless one of you lovely people is UK based or knows someone who is who'd actually want to help me, it probably can't happen sadly

\- I'm a broke, disabled student so don't really have thousands to invest in this

However, here's the thing, he is the only guy that touches any of it and has been there for 20+ years. 

I asked him about it and he told me it is so that when he goes on vacation, someone else can easily take over for him and he has no worries about things going wrong or getting called.  He really taught me a lesson that day since I've always been someone who thinks the office needs me specifically to handle everything and it makes taking vacation and truly relaxing pretty tough.

There wasn't a problem that was solved - just added complexity to something rudimentary. There wasn't anything abstract or novel in the execution or outcome that isn't more easily addressed through other means. And wow... the execution was lacking. The electrical components were simply assembled from off-the-shelf items, the mechanical components are rudimentary and sloppily made, and they have to hand-tailor the instructions for each song - so nothing apparently abstract or elegant in the software side of things either it seems. If it's a simple hand-off between the computer and system controller, then at least it's somewhat cool.

After all of that, the glockenspiel sounds horrible what with mallets bouncing and resting on the bars, and being drowned out by the solenoids.

Honestly guys, a wind turbine fixed on the ground can extract energy from the wind, why do you think that it would be different on the car? Of course you would need a wind speed with a component opposed to the car direction to be able to extract more energy than needed to move the turbine. In that case it's exactly the same principle as a normal turbine, the energy extracted is superior to the energy necessary to keep it at the car speed.

So the way the writers put their situation forward, they often say that ""the company"", or ""we"" are forging signatures, skimming materials, etc. But what I see when reading between the lines is that the poster has actually knowingly taken part of the activities, but has reached a breaking point, but don't know how to proceed.

This creates a problem for the ""document and report it"" advice - They would be implicating themselves. If I'm being honest to myself, I wouldn't report something that I was a part of, for fear of losing my job, and potentially gaol time. So when we see these posts, it's already too late; the poster dun goofed.

Now, engineers hold a very powerful role in society, and everyone in the developed world relies on our work in hundreds of ways that impact their safety and livelihoods, yet they dont even know about it. They don't get the choice of choosing which engineers (especially civil) built their apartment, or designed their traffic lights, or provided their drinking water. So ethically it falls on us. And then legally, there are many checks to make sure that these ethics are approximately upheld; even if one has different ethical beliefs. Which brings me to my point.

**The only way to win is not to play.**

Don't let yourself be put in this situation. If something feels or is wrong, don't ignore it; investigate it. If you're given a task that seems a bit 'off', ask the person if they understand the legal implications of their request. Under no circumstances take on something you know or reasonably suspect to be illegal, because then you're a part of it, and there is no turning back. This applies to many tasks, such as tendering, design, signing off, and worksite safety.

---

To show it can be done, even as a graduate, I have examples. I have occasionally questioned my site-manager when I suspected something was amiss. Half the time I was just young and dumb, but sometimes it was enough for him to think about it himself. It might be a quick question like ""what happens if the subbies build to a drawing that hasn't got that signature?"", and I would see the cogs turning in his head about time delays, safety issues, and up to legal issues if it fails. In many cases, that would be enough, because he had missed that self-check because he were given instructions and was following through without much thought, forgetting he was liable too.

Hopefully by having a bit of foresight, we can prevent some of these ethics posts by stopping them at their source.",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/atar5b/engineering_ethics_and_legalities_please_dont_let/,602,"It's very important to be honest and humble enough to realize and admit when you've made a mistake too. It's happened to me a few times where I've realized we fucked up, whether it's something as simple as a drafting typo, or something bigger that we've missed entirely. Most of those times the mistakes would most likely never have been found out, or at least not for some time so I probably could have gotten away with it. But I informed the client, took the heat, and it was dealt with. The client is pissed off a bit, but after that wears off they ultimately respect your honesty and it builds trust.

* Don’t mention that you “soften language about (problem X)” in an email. This will end up highlighted by the attorneys.
* Don’t save previous drafts with language you think is problematic crossed out in tracked changes.
* Don’t try to be sarcastic in written communication. This will be highlighted by the attorneys with question marks.

TL;DW: 50% solar and 50% wind, you can be just about 100% renewable with overcapacity of 120% and 12 hours of battery storage. You still have the issue of localization and extended outages (no solar for longer periods in winter, and there could be times of low wind that overlap). I think this could be solved in most places with on-site battery backups (especially for homes) that would provide 48 hours of local backup in addition to grid-level storage. On average, this would require 60kwh of storage per home for 48 hours of complete off-grid backup. With battery prices falling below $100/kwh soon, at scale, this might cost $8000 per home, or $27 per month amortized over a 25 year term.

484,gnpcn1,False,[GENERAL],106,What did you create as an intern that makes you cringe now?,engineering,"So when I was an intern as a sophomore I was tasked to design this skid to hold an electric motor for transport on a flab bed.  No biggie right?  I modeled it up in Inventor and did some basic stress analysis on the static weight of the motor which made me modify the design but ultimately I finished the drawing package and it got sent to the fabricator.  No reviews with the other engineer (yes 1).  No reviews with management.  I basically designed this thing off a welders napkin sketch and everyone was like ""ok, sure. Lets order some metal.""

So, the crazy part is this was a 20,000 hp electric motor.  Giant beast that barely fit on the flatbed.  The diameter had to be around 5 ft so you can see how high the CoG would be.  Also, it had to be under a certain width to fit on the highway without wide load restrictions so you know how skinny this skid had to be.

I did zero analysis on acceleration loads, braking loads, side loads, tie down supports, crash safety, vibration etc.   I don't work in DOT so I'm sure there is a whole slew of things that have to be analyzed and approved.  My analysis was also as if this thing was made out of a piece of billet and nothing was welded.

I kind of forgot about the project but 2-3 years later I was in a different internship during my final semester (yeah, it took me 6 years...) working for the power company and we just happened to stumble across this thing in the yard at the steel mill.  I immediately came to the realization that this thing was woefully under-designed and asked if I could talk to the guy who was in charge of that if it was ever needed.  The guys I asked (mill guys) laughed it off and basically told me ""it got here didn't it"" so don't worry about it.

I even contacted my original internship and let my old manager know the situation but he said the company wouldn't touch it.  The product was already out of their hands.

Still haunts me to this day.

Each notebook in the series is going to have a cover that represents different engineering disciplines (Mechanical, Civil, Aerospace, Electrical, etc). Each engineering discipline will be represented by a simple graphic on the cover, as well as inside cover art that explores that discipline further. Here are some mock-ups of works-in-progress:

I've been working with other engineering sub reddits this past week to help me better understand what symbols could represent their whole field. I'm now coming to the r/engineering mothership for suggestions on what fields I'm missing. For this project I'm looking to make between 10-12 unique notebooks that represent major branches within the field of engineering. The series of notebooks is constrained in 3 ways: page size (8.5x11"") , Binding (hardcover sewn layflat), and inside paper type (engineering grid - [https://imgur.com/qYzaxtM](https://imgur.com/qYzaxtM)). So I'm looking for fields that, a) use notebooks, and b) use engineering grid. In subsequent product launches we can explore other options, but for now these are the project constraints.

**Here is a list of the current notebooks in the series:**

* Mechanical Engineering
* Astronautical Engineering
* Aeronautical Engineering
* Chemical Engineering
* Electrical Engineering
* Civil Engineering
* Material Science (proposed in thread)
* Software (proposed in thread)
* Marine (proposed in thread)

* a sextant
* a steam locomotive
* a pushrod engine like what you'd see on a boat
* power plants (the entire field of thermodynamics is mechanical)
* the Mars rover
* control systems... hard to illustrate, but like a spacecraft landing or something
 
For engineering in general you could use:

* a compass or other variation of drafting tools

In fact, this is the first semester that I'm taking these courses, and I'm paying completely out of pocket through tax breaks and credit cards.  Just last semester I achieved my first scholarship and brought my GPA back up to a 2.8 and was back in good standing with the school from years ago when I dropped out.

I feel a little cheated, because I was under the impression that this was an Engineering degree.  Only after I paid for these classes and made a resume including ""Engineering"" as my degree, was I corrected that this was an ""Engineering Technology"" degree.  I feel like I'm out a few thousand dollars and I'm not completely sure if this will be the right decision for me!  I have absolutely no problem with the math or science of an engineering degree.  That's why I decided to switch to engineering!

But they referred me to a school for an ABET accredited ET BS in Florida, and I think that would qualify me for the PE license?

So do I rip the bandaid now and switch back to an Engineering AA??  I don't even know if I'll be able to afford an ABET accredited BA without obtaining a job in the field with some kind of tuition reimbursement, and that will put me another semester behind!   ",2017-03-19 23:36:27

As engineers we are blessed to be in an extremely lucrative job market.  Even though it’s very tough for employees to find solid engineering talent or pays dearly for it, it’s still uncommon to offer non-managing engineers retention bonuses.  

If you’re lucky, HR and management at your company is in tune with the job market and is compensating you at market rates.  If you’re unlucky like I previously was, HR views their job to keep costs down by doing just enough to keep you around then using other motivational methods to boost retention.  Eventually I found myself managing engineers who just graduated school and made more than me out of the gate!

I used to feel a sense of loyalty and tried for over a year to work with HR to fix this obvious mistake.  It turns out the mistake was I was being loyal to a company that had no interest in loyal employees other than underpaying them and milking them along.  Someone pointed out if they were so loyal we’d have contracts to make sure we didn’t leave.  No contract?  Don’t feel one once of guilt if you’re looking.  For me I found a job I like much better, get paid much better, and work for a company that uses their HR department to make sure their valued employees stick around.  

Corporate HR departments will frequently set up systems that make you believe you have no control.     “Raises are capped at 4% which is industry standard”, or my favorite “we want you to always be below the midpoint in the system so you can continue to get larger than average raises”.  This is all BS if you’re a good performer and not being paid at least average.  Systems like this tend to leave loyal long term employees behind the market. Just remember the most powerful tool you have is your free agency.  If you don’t love your job or they aren’t paying you what you’re worth go out and get it!  

I truly hope you love your job, have a great employer, and can mutually benefit each other with a long term relationship.  Reward those employers! Those employers deserve us  to look around so they can get the best ones!",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/7m4acz/always_remember_youre_a_free_agent/,527,"I think only a few specific fields are lucrative (Software, Civil).

It seems to be a $10 subway ride isn't the end of the world, considering how expensive a cup of coffee is in that town.

Also, the other issue I had, it seems that if I took the train, it didn't matter if it was just a couple stations or all the way up to Harlem from the Financial District, I paid the same price unless I changed lines.
That doesn't make sense from the cost to the system my ridership incurs: weight, volume on the train at rush hour, etc. 

It seems that a short ride should be more affordable than a long one, as an example. Prepay a full-price fair, but if you exit early, then you get some back into your account.

Even if the center can counteract for any minute disruption it can only send the ball out of the center.  My point was, by translating the surface during the impact, spin could be induced.  This effectively dampens translation forces, creating a “pull” towards the center.   The spin can then be negated on the next bounce by translating the surface opposite.

It’s only an idea, the feed back loop sounds horrendous at this point and given the sensors may be secondary to the delay.  How do you infer spin?  ",2019-03-30 06:49:29

Inigo:  I think it would work best if the Flux Capacitor used a single 1.21 GW power supply rather than the two 605 MW power supplies that we've used on similar machines in the past.  It will simplify the design and halve the maintenance requirements.

Project Manager:  Would the Powers That Be even allow that?  I've never even heard of someone doing it that way before.

Inigo:  I agree that it would be an unusual configuration but I believe the only reason it hasn't been done before was availability of 1.21 GW power supplies.  Tell ya what, I'll take the action item and talk to Head Honcho to get his buy in.

569,fl9brm,False,[GENERAL],203,A Primer on FDA Regulations (USA) because Manufacture of Medical Devices is HIGHLY Regulated,engineering,"\[EDIT 1 - Added some MAUDE reports so you can see what failures can occur in ventilators that result in them being pulled from service or that result in providers being pulled from patients.\]

I've seen a LOT of posts, including an entire subreddit, about how engineers can help ease the strain on the healthcare system.  I don't want to dampen the innovative spirit, but discussions about open-source ventilators and other medical products NEED to consider or be aware of FDA regulations surrounding the manufacture of medical devices.  I'm currently in the legal field but before that I spent nearly 5 years as a product development engineer of medical devices.  The majority spent with Class III devices (life sustaining), devices that face the most stringent regulations.

Before I get on my soapbox of why these regulations are important and which regulations could be suspended, [21 CFR 820](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820) (link to table of contents) regulates the manufacture and design of medical devices.  Specifically, the following regulations will be the toughest to suspend (and in my belief should not be suspended):

* [Subpart C - Design Controls](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1&subpartNode=21:8.0.1.1.12.3)
   * This is key for DIYers and Open Sourcers.  If a Ford or GM decides to manufacture a device, they'll likely receive an approved design from Medtronic or other major ventilator manufacturer.
* [Subpart G - Production and Process Controls](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1&subpartNode=21:8.0.1.1.12.7)
   * G, H, and M are where Ford et al., are not prepared.
* [Subpart H - Acceptance Activities](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1&subpartNode=21:8.0.1.1.12.8)
* [Subpart M - Records](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1&subpartNode=21:8.0.1.1.12.13)

The remaining regulations in 820 are important, but most large ISO certified manufacturers will have some version of these controls in place.

I'll keep my reasoning for keeping regulations in place short and encourage you to read through the regulations if you are interested.  NOTE: This is not to be a complete buzzkill for all the great ideas for innovations, but a word of caution that the ideas generated right now are likely most useful internationally or as a starting point to prepare for the next pandemic or global health crisis.

1. Patient Outcomes - life sustaining devices like ventilators and diagnostic tests that would inform a medical decision of hospitalization when the hospital systems anticipate strain, NEED to be made properly for the sake of patients.  Ask yourself, if you could be treated by a device made under the controls of the regulations versus a device that might malfunction (and cause electrical shock, not alarm when it needs to, etc.) what would you choose.  I know the third option is that there is no device available, but the risks of a faulty device are very high (I would go no device rather than a potentially faulty device).
   1. *See edit below for reported adverse events*
2. Traceability - ventilators, respirators, and diagnostic tests must be developed and manufactured properly and with appropriate traceability.  Medical device manufacturers DO make mistakes even in the regulated environment, manufacturing defects are minimized by traceability.  Because of the traceability, if an EMC gasket of a certain lot is found to be faulty, the manufacturer can trace every machine with gaskets of that lot and fix them.  Without this kind of traceability, you need to do mass recalls like the auto industry does.
3. Acceptance Activities - Every ventilator will need to be tested.  All the test equipment must be validated, calibrated, verified, and recorded, among other things.  This takes time.  A ventilator that runs for days or weeks at a time will likely need a test to simulate continuous use for each lot (if not each unit).  Such tests require time.
4. Records - This goes to traceability, but one thing that is different from most large volume manufacturing is that EACH device has a record, not just each lot.  We do not want to suspend this rule.
5. Costs and Reuse - Post-pandemic, devices made outside of the regulatory framework will need to be disposed of.  Perhaps thats a just another casualty of the pandemic.

There are more issues, but these are the big ones for me.  There are legal issues for liability and intellectual property that are also of concern but thats for another post.

\[EDIT 1 - 13:05pm\]

I'm not going to do a full cost-benefit analysis of using unregulated devices versus regulated devices or ""emergency"" devices versus standard devices.  However, you can look at the [FDA's Adverse Reporting System, MAUDE](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/Search.cfm?smc=1), for how ventilators fail.  Failure of ventilators is not just a risk for the patient and isn't always a risk of life or death.  Failure of devices pulls healthcare providers away from other patients.  Failure of devices also results in them being pulled from service.  This is not a debate over whether failing ventilators are better than none, just providing additional information.  If you search on your own, you'll see 500 events from the last year, MOST of these are the result of issues found during servicing.

619,97j16i,False,[GENERAL],125,Why Public Speaking is the MOST IMPORTANT SKILL for ALL engineers; Even if you don’t talk to groups,engineering,"*I wanted to share a post I just published on my Quora Blog. The entire article is cut & pasted below, please enjoy and let me know what you think*

**Why Public Speaking is the MOST IMPORTANT SKILL for ALL engineers; Even if you don’t talk to groups**

As an engineer with 16+ years experience in the mechanical/energy engineering field, I can honestly say that the single most important course you can take and skill you can develop is . . .

**Public Speaking.**

Yes, you read that right.

Public speaking is one of the most important classes I took while I was an undergraduate mechanical engineering student. It really helped me gain a skill that has served me well over the years.

I already hear the push back . . . “but I don’t plan to speak to groups” . . . “it’s just not my thing so why bother”

Here’s the thing, when people think public speaking, they think Tony Robbins getting in front a whole crowd. They think about the Sunday morning speeches given by the pastor in church or perhaps a stand up comedian in front of a room full of people waiting to be entertained.

However, that is a very narrow view of public speaking. In my mind, any time you are talking and others are listening without any back and forth, you have moved from a conversation to public speaking.

Giving a company overview to two potential investors? Public Speaking.

Presenting your firm to potential employees at a job fair? Public Speaking.

Discussing your team’s latest project at a staff meeting? Public Speaking.

Therefore, this is a useful skill even if you never give a speech to large groups. During your career, you will have to present your projects, your company, and yourself to your team and/or clients. If you don’t have the ability to push your ideas forward and gain buy-in from others, then you are setting yourself up to often be a step behind.

Being able to publicly convey your ideas is one of the most powerful ways to gain that buy-in and flourish in your career.

When it comes to job or internship interviews, you will have the ability to present yourself better and will you to shine once you land the interview and once you get into the position.

I consider this to be one of the most important “peripheral skills” that has helped me have engineering success.

Ok, so now you realize the importance of public speaking, but is it really more important than technical skills? I would answer a resounding “YES” to that question. There is often a way to set up your career to avoid certain technical skills that are not to your liking.

This does not mean that I think that public speaking is more important than technical skills in general.  Rather, I think as a single skill it is more important than other single technical skills.  Of course, you need to have sound engineering skills to land the job in the first place.  However, to advance up the ladder and gain success in your engineering career you definitely need solid public speaking skills.

For example, I have avoided both calculus and chemistry and last used them when I took my professional engineering licensing exams. These two subjects are not really of interest to me and I am able to avoid them in my professional engineering career.

However, you CAN’T AVOID public speaking (as I defined it above) and that is what makes it the single greatest skill for your career.

Best of luck, Sol Rosenbaum, PE, CEM, CPMP

The end product is less portable and requires a lot of effort to make...barley enough airflow to fill a car tire in a reasonable amount of time.  And running air tools is out of the question.  Also you have electricity to power a lathe and a welder, but not an air compressor?

Also if you want to make a bike powered air compressor, why not just make something like what's commonly used for cyclists to train at home: https://vigorouspart555.guphotos.com/i/w?u=/images/Y/2/Y2362/Y2362-1-db6b-rLxE.jpg

Connect the output roller to the compressor with a simple belt and pully setup.  You could then also change the gear ratio by simply shifting gears on the bike, rather than physically disassembling everything and cutting up another bike for parts because you didn't bother to do the math the first time.

Geared turbofan is not a new idea, it's obvious that if you make an ""ideal turbine"", it's rotation speed will never match the ""ideal fan"" speed. A gearbox fixes that but such a high power high speed gearbox was not economically viable before. 

Most of that 30 years it was not ""in development"" as much as on the back burner.

Also that 16% figure is highly suspect. It's more efficient than a similar sized turbofan, not more efficient than all other turbofan designs, that reduces the competition a lot. ",2015-10-20 01:32:49

650,f01bky,False,None,95,How to find an engineering job,engineering,"This is a guide to searching for a job. It’s intended for people seeking an engineering job, and assumes some experience, although it may be useful in other cases.

**The Resume**

This is the primary document that an employer is going to read. It defines your education and experience. It must be clear and logical, get right to the point, and use a standard format. Employers have a limited amount of time, so don’t waste words with irrelevant stuff. Every word should be about your engineering skills, not sports, church, hobbies, or anything else that isn’t relevant to an engineering job.

Your resume should start with your experience in reverse chronological order, followed by education. Some people put a summary at the top; if you do that, it should be a single sentence, and avoid useless jargon. Probably exclude teenage jobs, unless you have no other jobs.

Use more words to describe you recent jobs. If you worked on several projects, describe each of them. Older jobs can be summarized more briefly.

Probably skip high school in the education section, unless you were valedictorian or something. List your bachelors degree GPA if it’s good (maybe >3.2/4); otherwise skip that.

Don’t do anything goofy or clever. Don’t put in pictures, banners, charts, colors, jokes, etc. That only works in the movies.

**Cover Letter**

The resume tells about you experience and education, and the cover letter is more of a story about why you are good for this job, what you like to do, etc.

Some people consider the cover letter irrelevant these days, but write one anyway. Don’t just re-state your resume; say different stuff that makes you seem just right for the job.

Some job sites don’t allow you to include a cover letter. Move on.

**Finding the Job**

Some people will say that job ads are useless; that you need to know somebody to find a job. That’s obviously untrue, because thousands of employers pay money to list jobs online, and have elaborate processes for applying to those positions.

If you have contacts in the industry, hit them all with a message explaining what job you’re looking for. But many engineers, especially younger ones, don’t have a good network, so job ads it is.

Indeed.com is an excellent place to find jobs. LinkedIn is also good, and there are many other sites. Also, once you find a job post, you can then go straight to that employer’s career site and see what else there is. You can also search for firms in your target area and go right to their career sites.

Recruiters can be useful, but they often have limited knowledge about your skills and what jobs are appropriate. Some of them are useless idiots. It would probably be a good idea to get a personal recommendation for a recruiter, if you don’t want to waste time.

**Execution**

The plan for a deer hunter is to take one good shot and achieve success.

Job hunting never works that way. You can do everything right, and not get the job. Often, you will never know why it didn’t work. Job hunting is more like hockey: you hit it again and again, and sometimes you will score.

Don’t take it personally if a job application is rejected, or you get no response at all. And don’t waste time crying about it. Expect this to happen a lot of the time. If you get an interview from 20% of your applications, you are awesome.

You should start by applying to every job post that is even semi-appropriate. Sometimes jobs are poorly described, and they might be more appropriate than you think. It’s not your job to back away from a position that isn’t a good fit; the employer will take care of that.

Make a spreadsheet to keep track of whom you applied to, what response you got, the contact info, interview notes, etc. It’s easy to lose track of these details once you have a dozen applications in the air.

Make a folder for each job application, with the job description, your cover letter, and the resume that you sent. You may want to edit you resume a bit for each job, to emphasize the right skills.

**Will it Work?**

Your odds of success are a function of how good your skills are, how well you speak in an interview, how well you track down the best jobs, and how many applications you send out. Those first 2 things may be hard to fix, but those last 2 things you can start on today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/f01bky/how_to_find_an_engineering_job/,447,[deleted] ,2020-02-06 23:32:10

706,2o9dho,False,[GENERAL],73,The empty toothpaste box problem,engineering,"This is kind of a repost from /r/pics  

http://i.imgur.com/0HMuaPx.jpg  

This guy was noticing beer cans not feeding properly and attached a red wire to act as a guide, which reminded me of a story:  

A toothpaste factory had a problem: Due to the way the production line was set up, sometimes empty boxes were shipped without the tube inside. People with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming off of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which cannot be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean quality assurance checks must be smartly distributed across the production line so that customers all the way down to the supermarket won’t get frustrated and purchase another product instead.   

Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory gathered the top people in the company together. Since their own engineering department was already stretched too thin, they decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem.   

The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP (request for proposal), third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later a fantastic solution was delivered — on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. The problem was solved by using high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box would weigh less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box off the line, then press another button to re-start the line.   

A short time later, the CEO decided to have a look at the ROI (return on investment) of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. There were very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. “That was some money well spent!” he said, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.    

The number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. How could that be? It should have been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers indicated the statistics were indeed correct. The scales were NOT picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.   

Perplexed, the CEO traveled down to the factory and walked up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before the scale, a $20 desk fan was blowing any empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. Puzzled, the CEO turned to one of the workers who stated, “Oh, that…One of the guys put it there ’cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang!”  


Moral of the story? If there's a problem on the line, talk to your line workers BEFORE going back to the design table. They truly are your most valuable resource.

My idea would be to create a course to show how to build practical software to solve problems that engineers have at work. This would help being more effective and efficient with your time at work. It would also allow you to help colleagues with programming problems and become an indispensable team member at work. 

The things I want to be sure to cover would be:

- interface with excel (get numbers and data in and out of excel in a breeze)

- call programs and simulation from a script to automate the repetitive stuff

- build a quick smartphone and tablet ready web app to display result

- automate report generation (you just generated new graphs and don't want to copy-paste them all in a new report, no problem!)

His first point concerning luxury is completely off base. Luxury does not necessarily mean durable. It mean high quality. High quality items can still break because they’re a lot more complex. It’s the same reason Toyota’s last a lot longer than expensive luxury cars. If you want to go buy a Nokia brick phone I’m sure it’ll last you for as long as you live if thats what you’re after.

Also, his point saying how as a repair person he sees a lot of Apple products is obviously going to be true considering Apple products are overwhelmingly owned by consumers. There’s way more Apple products being used than other brands and that means there’s more chances for a person who needs a repair to have an Apple product. 

Many of the “problems” he brought up weren’t even really true problems. I’m sure a select few encountered the iPhone 6 bend/flex problem, but everyone in my family and a lot of my friends have owned an iPhone 6 and not one of them have ever showed any signs of bending. 

He also likes to bring up the fact that people were unable to turn on their laptops because of a problem that could only be fixed under warranty if they turned on their laptops - which happened to be a very very old laptop, but he conveniently forgets to mention that Apple fixed iPhone batteries that had problems or MacBook keyboards for very little to no charge at all which I found out first hand was a very easy and simple solution. Not once did I feel like Apple was screwing me unless it was due to something I caused like dropping and cracking my screen. Again luxury doesn’t mean it’s built like a tank. 

Finally, as an engineer which I assume you’re not, you can’t expect to have a 100% success rate with everything especially when it’s on the cutting edge of technology. You seem shocked to hear this as if every single brand out there doesn’t have these problems and has an equal or better product.

We're usually the guys that no one remembers exists.

I don't work at VW, but at a contemporary. As soon as I heard about what they were accused of doing I thought about how I would do something similar. I can't guarantee this is *exactly* how VW does it, but just looking at [Indeed it's how a large number of companies do it.](http://www.indeed.com/q-Calibration-Diesel-Engineer-Engineer-jobs.html)

1. IMHO, forget any ""it was an an accident"". It's hard enough to make things work the way you want them to as is. This went through no more than a dozen people for multiple stages of development.

2. There are really only 3 OEMs for Diesel ECMs: [Bosch, Denso & Delphi](http://imgur.com/pPpn1DC). VW isn't running their own custom hardware, they outsource it to Bosch. The latest Bosch diesel ECM is the EDC17.

3. The EDC17 is running a [Infineon 32-Bit Tricore uC](http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-tricore-tm-microcontroller/channel.html?channel=ff80808112ab681d0112ab6b64b50805).

4. The ECMs is most likely through [Simulink](http://www.mathworks.com/products/connections/product_detail/product_35878.html) (Ours is). There are a few companies that provide [Simulink/Matlab support](http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/development-tools-software-and-kits/tricore-tm-development-tools-software-and-kits/simulation/modelling/channel.html?channel=ff80808112ab681d0112ab6b596207e5).

5. ECMs are tuned through [VectorCANape](https://vector.com/vi_canape_en.html). Everyone I know of uses CANape. As far as I know there isn't really any competitors. [Here's a youtube video showing the 'latest features' of CANape12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrlCRuHr0XQ&list=PL36EEEC4559038DF6). (When I started we were stuck with CANape 6.5 for ages).

6. A decade ago there may have been 10-20 adjustment maps. Temperature, boost pressure, barometric pressure, coolant temperature, etc. Now there are dozens if not hundreds of maps. At $10k/hr+ for test cell time you don't 'accidentally' calibrate a map that you don't need.

7. The EPA has mandated that I have to try and defeat you defeating me. This includes encrypting everything, checking if you try and remove the DPF or EGR, etc.

Edit: Some more things.

8\. Not sure who VW uses but there are only [3 compilers for the Infineon Tricore.](http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/development-tools-software-and-kits/tricore-tm-development-tools-software-and-kits/compiler-tool-chains/channel.html?channel=ff80808112ab681d0112ab6b55d607d9). All of support of any of those compilers doesn't come cheap either.

9\. I've found *some* documentation that the EDC17 is [AUTOSAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOSAR) compliant. However a lot of this documentation is under NDA so it's hard to find decent information on Google.

10\. The EDC17 is *9* years old. Once you get something working you stop trying to be the 'newest'. You can't just toss a RaspPi or Adruino under the hood to run these things. Under the hood with diesel engines in one of the worst environments. It shakes, it's dirty, you have to be able to handle a lot of stray voltages. 

11\. If this is stuff that interests you and you want to go into this industry as a living:

- EE's look into the [ST SPC5-32bit](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/sense_power/FM2098/SC963?icmp=sc963_pron_launch-eiger_apr2015&sc=spc5-pr1) chips/boards or the [FreeScale e200](http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/white_paper/E200CORELCNWP.pdf)/[Freescale MPC56xx](http://www.freescale.com/products/power-architecture-processors/mpc5xxx-5xxx-32-bit-mcus/mpc56xx-mcus:MPC56XX?cof=0&am=0).

- ME's, [learn Simulink](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=AircraftPitch&section=SimulinkModeling). Inside and out. [Model based control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_design) is becoming the industry standard. As far as I know everyone uses some variant [of what Caterpllar published](http://www.mathworks.com/tagteam/20303_91198_Caterpillar_2004-01-0894.pdf) they do in 2004. That stuff is mature enough to be in the [Aerospace industry](http://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/airbus-helicopters-accelerates-development-of-do-178b-certified-software-with-model-based-design.html?by=product). Those non-Free compilers [go ""out of their way""](http://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/vxworks.html) to support Simulink. [Boeing](http://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/matlab-and-simulink-help-land-unpiloted-boeing-spacecraft.html?by=product), [Bell Helicopter](http://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/video-using-model-based-design-bell-helicopter-creates-the-worlds-first-civilian-tiltrotor.html?by=product), [ABB](http://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/abb-accelerates-application-control-software-development-for-a-power-electronic-controller.html?by=product), [Daimler](http://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/daimler-designs-cruise-controller-for-mercedes-benz-trucks.html?by=product), [NASA](http://www.mathworks.com/company/user_stories/nasa-marshall-space-flight-center-internship-program.html?by=product), etc.

12\. Learn about eTPU's. [FreeScale has some precompiled](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/etpu/) functions. As far as I know there isn't a free eTPU compiler. There's [Ashware](https://www.ashware.com/) and [Bytecraft](http://www.bytecraft.com/eTPU_C).

Also, if there are any EE hardware engineers out there that would like to develop a modern diesel ECM for 4-6 cylinder engines. From rotary pump, [Pumpe Düse""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_injector), to[Common Rail](http://de.bosch-automotive.com/en/parts/parts_and_accessories/motor_and_sytems/diesel/common_rail_injection/common_rail_diesel_motorsys_parts)...

The post says that the writer is a student at UPenn. **I'd like to know if others find this anecdote to be accurate regarding the difference between the two fields.**

""I'm currently pursuing degrees in Mechanical Engineering and in Physics. Perhaps this personal anecdote can shed light on the difference:

When I was a sophomore I was taking a waves and oscillations course housed in the Physics department along with a statics / strength of materials course housed in the engineering department. This rarely happens, but the material lined up across the two courses almost perfectly for about one week. Even rarer was that I was assigned the same exact problem in both classes!

The problem, for those interested (skip without loss of meaning if not), was to determine, for a cable clamped at two ends, the displacement at any given point if the cable were subjected to symmetric, asymmetric, and random loading. The problem was fairly complex.

In the engineering class I began by drawing diagrams, applying some fundamental physics laws, and seeing where it would take me. It took me down a nasty path full of nonlinear equations. After getting to these equations, I complained to the professor that it was almost impossible to find an exact solution to the problem. His response: ""Ya I know. We're engineers we don't care about exact solutions. Exact solutions don't exist in the real world. The best we can do is approximate."" He then advised that I go write a MATLAB script to apply some numerical methods to the equations I derived. I did just that and got a pretty good solution.

In the Physics class I handed in the solution that I had received full marks for in the engineering class. My physics professor was not impressed. ""Drew, Physicists build mathematical models, not numerical models. Go back and work through the math so you can find a general Mathematical solution for the displacement"". I complained that no one could solve the derived equations, that I had to use the numerical methods. He told me to use some sneaky math tricks to simplify the equations. After applying some of these tricks (for those interested, I used a bunch of Taylor expansions + limit elimination) I boiled down the final equation to a fairly routine  equation that I could easily solve. The final solution wasn't even that bad looking. However, I looked at the assumptions I made to arrive to the equation and I realized that it described nothing in the real world. Yet, this model ended up helping us derive some complicated wave equations later on in the course. 

Thus, for a physicist, it made sense to come up with a simplified mathematical model so that it could be applied to other systems and built upon for greater use. For an engineer, it didn't make sense because these simplified models would not have accurately described the immediate system they were working with.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/4ws9ma/excellent_anecdote_explaining_how_engineering_is/,411,Later ,2016-08-08 20:21:42

747,dnfau3,False,None,9,The Material Science of Metal 3D Printing,engineering,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBRYsiyxjI,408,"I have a few things to add on to this video, which were touched on briefly, but not necessarily in the scope of the video. 3D printing \*is\* a new process and we're learning more about it, but for some parts, it is definitely a cost benefit.

Consider both RelativitySpace and SpaceX -- both of these companies currently 3D print their rocket chambers. These get very hot during operation, and you could definitely destroy the chamber within seconds if you don't have a way to cool them. Conventionally, the process is that you have to mill the cooling channels. The larger the chamber, the more channels you have to mill. Sometimes these channels can have bifurcations which can even further increase machining time. Then, you have to close out the channels somehow. 

1, you can try electronickel plating, a process that takes a long time (and requires a large bath). 

2, you can try laser cladding (a process similar to DMLS - requires a machine). 

3, you can try to ""shrink fit"" a jacket onto the chamber - but if your tolerances aren't exactly right, the jacket will not properly bond to half of the channels.

Something that was touched on in the video was the cost and number of machines required to make 3D printing sustainable, and used the chambers as an example -- then proceeded to use injection molding as a counterexample for kicking out parts quickly. Try to MIM a bunch of finished chambers at one time -- go ahead, I'll wait. 

The fact is, making these chambers with conventional manufacturing techniques also takes a long time, and also requires multiple machines (for each process step) if you want to increase part output. For these chambers, if speed is of the most importance (think about it -- delaying launch dates ALSO costs money), I think 3D printing is the way to go. Hell, for a lot of smaller parts, 3D printing could save a lot of money. 

Of course, you wouldn't send your model of a conventionally machined part and ask the vendor to print it. The part should be designed for 3D printing (and hopefully, with the idea of no machining to light machining afterwards -- otherwise you haven't done the process its justice). As you would design a part for conventional manufacturing, you would design it for 3D printing -- perhaps you could include a non-solid ""in-fill"" to reduce part weight while still retaining overall strength. You wouldn't design a part to have an ""overhang"", where it has to build solid material on top of loose powder; and if you did, proper support structure would be put in place so that it could be built effectively. To maximize output, you could include multiple parts on the same build plate (and they don't even have to be the same part) -- the video showed a few frames of impellers being stacked on a build plate, but didn't really talk about this point.  

Also, The stress relief process is so extremely important in all 3D printed parts. When you print, you have to attach the part to something (a build plate) and in the process of fusing the layers together you create so many internal stresses. The video talked about trying to remove internal stresses with different scan structures (5 mm squares are pretty big, if you think about the fact that the powder grains are 40µm big in diameter), but the most important part is the annealing. Obviously, you have to separate the part from the build plate at some point, but if you try to bandsaw or EDM the part off, parts (especially larger parts) are more likely to ""potato chip"" or warp.

I'm sorry if your field didn't make it on this list, once we see how the series sells we can add more designs and sizes in the future. There were a number of  suggestions that I wasn't able to use mostly due to copyright  infringement, so I'm sorry if there is some important circuit diagram or  graphic that didn't make it -- believe me I tried to incorporate every  single suggestion.

845,6kxowt,False,[GENERAL],267,Engineering Brain Teaser Interview Questions?,engineering,"I had an engineering interview once where they asked some engineering brain teaser type questions. I will list the questions I was asked below, but what are some others? I think these are very good thought provoking engineering questions.

**Question 1:**
There are 2 balls a few inches apart on a flat table. Give 3 methods for getting ball #1 to touch ball #2 without touching any of the balls.

Answer I gave:
1. Lift edge of the table to cause balls to roll
2. Blow one ball into the other
3. Depends on material, but use of electrostatic or magnetic forces to move balls

**Question 2:**
You live in a world where everyone weighs at most 100 pounds. You are an engineer at a simple chair manufacturing company. The chairs are simply designed - 4 legs and a seat. Nothing fancy. You want to design the most cost efficient chair. What weight do you design each of the four legs of the chair to support? 

Answer I gave:
100 pounds each + some factor of safety....because people like to lean in chairs and sometimes they might even lean back and balance on one leg. Thus for 'idiot proofing' 100 pounds is required per leg.

**Question 3:**
My friend Mario owns a pizza place. The pizza place has an awning sticks out of the building horizontally, 90 degrees to the building, and only supported where it attaches at the building. *(this wasn't stated, but it's basically just a cantilevered beam)*. The top side of the awning is constructed from steel and the bottom side of the awning is constructed out of concrete and they are bonded perfectly at the neutral axis. 

*On a whiteboard the awning was simply drawn*

Now it comes a big snow and the awning is covered in snow. Draw on the whiteboard how the awning would deflect.

I take the marker and draw something along the lines of [this](https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/thermal-expansion/images/cantilever.gif) without all the text and such. Just the lines.

Now since the awning is deflected, all of Mario's customers are hitting their head as they're trying to get into the pizza parlor. So Mario goes to Lowe's and buys a 4x4 and props up the awning. Now with the support at the end of the awning, show how the awning deflects with the support and snow.

I take the marker and draw something like the bottom of [this pic](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3591a7cb9f2b6a4fbbeabb0dd62e7a35)

Okay, now as Mario's friend, do you recommend that he leaves the support in place or remove the support? Explain your answer.

Answer I gave: He should remove the support because steel is great in tension and concrete is great at compression. By leaving the support in, you're putting the concrete in tensions and it will likely break under load. 

----------------------------------

Anyways, those are the questions. I thought they were fun and forced critical engineering thinking. 

Got anymore questions like this? 

Edit: this particular interview was for a mechanical engineering position, but I have the flair for general because I'm looking for general engineering questions like these to ask to my friends and for myself.

932,hdvvwb,False,[GENERAL],149,"""Working from Home as Engineer could lead to subbing work overseas because it's cheaper""",engineering,"So I want some more seasoned people's opinions on this:

I currently work from home at my engineering consultant firm and have honestly transitioned quite well. So well in fact, I actually wouldn't mind doing this full time (maybe once a week going to the office for meetings and coordination).

&#x200B;

But I was told by an older associate that he worries if people just ""telecommute"" (i.e. work from home) it could lead the industry to just send the work overseas and have people who are paid pennies do the work while the company spends most of it's money on the manager's salaries. He argues that companies would have overseas people do all the CAD and modelling, as well as data analysis and what not and the managers just serve as reviewers of the work. 

So essentially all the E.I.T. work would be done overseas.

I had a problem with that because of the following:

1. Coordinating deadlines that frequently change would be a hassle with dealing with 8+ hr time changes.
2. I work in Civil infrastructure design, and I can only imagine the shit-storm politically that would happen if the press gets wind that ""Pakistan and Indians are designing our bridges and roads"". Not to mention the security risks of plan sets detailing our nations infrastructure getting into the hands of foreign countries.
3. There's an inherent trust issue with sending work to be done by someone you've never met or never will (as most 3rd party subcontractors can be).
4. The argument for this transition would be to save the company money, but wouldn't the other argument be that you're already saving money by reducing the office footprint?
5. How would you train future project managers? Because essentially, doing this would erase the middle step transition between clueless new-graduate/intern and P.M. Because most EITs do ""busy work"" to *learn* what it takes to be an effective engineer. So how would you train them?
6. We could *already* send work overseas, as the prospect of doing that is viable even if the option to work from home was never available due to this pandemic, and yet the industry *still* has clearly decided against it?

&#x200B;

I don't know, what do any of you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/hdvvwb/working_from_home_as_engineer_could_lead_to/,360,"Ultimately,  you need to have a pretty good sense of what your team's design skills are to trust them to do cad and design work while adhering your seal to the final documents.

That implies that it may partially be relying on the surface traction to be consistent and of a friction level within whatever tolerance range it assumes dry pavement to be.  It does not seem to gradually bleed off speed nor accommodate any significant difference in tire grip.  What happens in rain, on a gravel or sandy surface, in snow, on ice, etc?  I assume it just rear ends everything every time in any situation that isn't ideal.

With the modern and quite functional adaptive cruise control, I would VERY much expect the system to blend to the traffic speed and maintain a moderate driving distance, especially due to the very high differences in braking distance between cars and semis.

As much as this is supposed to tout the tech, which is interesting, I can only think of all the ways it could fail horribly just because it doesn't operate defensively and with high margins which is the ONLY way a semi should drive if autonomous in any way.

991,asnsw5,False,[GENERAL],26,"Recommendation for the book ""What If"". It's perfect for inquisitive engineers",engineering,"I just finished up the book What If by Randall Munroe and think it is a book a lot of those in this sub will enjoy.

The subtitle of the book is Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions and it does not disappoint.  He gives real engineering analysis to situations that are clearly out of the realm of possibility.  Some might start as possible situations, but he takes everything to the next level and goes well beyond the realm of possibility.  

Some of the questions he deals with are what would happen if the earth stopped rotating, what happens if you swim in the pool where they put spent nuclear rods, what would happen if we all aimed lasers at the moon.

The author is the writer of the Xkcd comic if you recognize the name.  

In any case, just wanted to share the recommendation here.  The book is also available on audiobook for those that prefer that mode.  

btw, one more thing that is great about this book is the real reader emails he includes at the end of some chapters.  You gotta wonder about some people based on these questions.

**EDIT - For those interested in buying the book, I was just on thriftbooks.com and did a quick search for it.  They have a few copies available for around $5.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XggxeuFDaDU

The damper is always in motion and I know that first hand.  I have also been to the top and that is in motion a lot more than I would have liked it to be after a week of eating sushi.

The damper acts like a capacitor in a circuit.  Your rigid parts are more like the resistors.  But they built the building as an engineering marvel.  While they were building that every plastic toy in the US had 'Made in Taiwan' stamped on it's bottom.    

So that damper swings forever like a pendulum.  And unlike the very rigid twin towers in New York and surrounding buildings Taipei 101 was built to flex and move with it's surroundings.  There are frequent wind storms and earthquakes.  

And building a building like that where it was.  It put it self in the way of strong winds.  From an engineering perspective it was a nightmare.  But it just so happened that everyone who lived on that street was an engineer.  

TL:DR  The ball always moves and it was designed to. ",2015-07-19 09:28:44
