There are so many legitimate complaints to make but college applications isn‚Äôt one of them. You could say ‚ÄúJunior prom‚Äù or talk about upperclassmen experiences, you could talk about varsity that everybody is suffering from. Like, please talk about something legitimate instead of a college process that‚Äôs been the same for years. Oh and college visits?

But that's what you get when we let money-hungry monsters control out secondary education."" - yours truly

""This app is an underrated gem. It cuts no corners and delivers savage, cutting gameplay, while simultaneously making you feel like a stressed out AP language student. Ever since I used this app, I no longer find horror movies to be scary, instead I find them rather comedic. True horror is . . . the right, claustrophobic mazelike corridors of the UI, and the dark secrets the fated ""exam"" will hold. That is, if the app stops crashing."" - [REDACTED]

""College Board is incredible. How a corporation can simultaneously have a 100% market share monopoly in a field, whilst also parading themselves around as non profit, is truly amazing.

ckhc0n,High School Survival Guide: Advice from a graduate,"Alright so I'm bored and I figured I would make this post to help all you guys starting high school within the next month, whether you be a freshman, or a senior, this will help you guys out.  Well, maybe not seniors, y'all are a lost hope if you haven't gotten your shit straight yet lmfao.

&#x200B;

Alright so let me tell you a little bit about myself, and then I will start with advice for underclassmen and work my way up to upperclassmen.  So my name's Nick, and I graduated high school last May in the class of 2019.  I'm from Massachusetts and am continuing my education at a state school here in MA for a major in marketing.  I attended a vocational school here in MA, studying in business.  Essentially trade schools, in my case a trade high school, teaches you certain trades such as business, electrical, cosmetology, etc. as well as regular academics to prepare students for the real world.  Moving on...

&#x200B;

FRESHMEN

Yup, your time has come.  All those years in elementary school pickin your nose, and coming home and masturbating every second of your life in middle school, now you're here in high school.  You don't know what to do.  Maybe you moved to a different area or a different school system so you won't see your old friends.  What do you do?

&#x200B;

My advice: Don't worry.  I know that it's easy to say that now seeing that I've already had to deal with it, but seriously the worst thing you can do walking into your first class on the first day of school is being so worked up about people looking at you and thinking about you that you shut yourself out from everyone else.  Believe me, all the others turds in that room are just as nervous as you are, and did the same embarrassing shit that you did in middle school.  On the other hand, however, don't be too overconfident, because people will just pass you up as being a tool, and that sticks with you forever.  Stay in the middle, be confident about who you are, and try to make connections with people that look like a good fit for you.  Also, don't come into first period math class thinking that you're going to find the love of your life either, any ""relationship"" that starts within the first month of school freshman year 10000% of the time fails.  Wait it out, the right person will come.

&#x200B;

UNDERCLASSMEN

Alright so this is for both freshmen AND sophomores.  Listen, these two years are WAY more important than people think they are.  These first two baby years of high school are going to determine who you are in the school's eyes, which means that if you act like a mongoloid freshman and sophomore year, and finally get your act straight during junior and senior years, schools that you are interested in are seriously going to look at that, especially some of those top-dog schools.

Another thing, if you're a sophomore or a junior, or whatever-the-fuck, and you're wondering why you still don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, well first of all, the essential, take a damn shower.  I CANNOT STRESS HOW MANY PEOPLE SMELL LIKE SHIT IN HIGH SCHOOL.  Didn't we get over this stench phase in 8th grade, I mean god damn.  Soap and water my friends, it makes a big difference.  

Another thing, wear PROPER clothes.  I've fallen victim to this, and it is VERY easy to do so.  I know how easy it is to roll out of bed at 6:30 a.m and just want to put on a sweatshirt and jogging pants, but I can't stress how much of a bum-ass loser it's going to make you look.  Listen, once and a while it's okay to dress like a wearable sleeping bag, but to do it EVERYDAY is a major issue.  People are going to think that you're gross, lazy, and have morning breath, and that shit's nasty man.  Honestly, just get some jeans (yes, it took me a longggg time to get used to jeans, American Eagle has the most comfortable pairs I've found) , buy a few flannels with a couple graphic and plain tees to throw under, and even get some nice buttoned party shirts (a really nice brand for mens shirts that I love is Target's Goodfellow, quality shirts for under $20.  H&M also has some nice button party shirts that'll make you look fly af). 

Finally my underclassmen, your GPA really DOES matter.  For high school and college admissions at least, after you get accepted to a school it doesn't mean shit, BUT, in the meantime, keep that up.  It's not that hard to keep a good GPA, especially if you take regular classes.  Keeping your GPA around 3.2 and up means that you are GOLDEN my friend.

&#x200B;

INCOMING JUNIORS

Yep, you think you're the big man on campus now.  You are officially an ""upperclassman"", and you can treat freshman and sophomores like your slaves.  Don't get too cocky though, it'll bite you in the ass.

First of all, let's get this straight: If you're a junior in high school and are over 16 years old, GET A DAMN JOB.  I can't tell you how many lazy asses I went to school with that didn't have any job coming into junior year or even senior year.  It's about time that your parents stop paying for that new pair of $600 Nikes, it's pathetic.  I wanted to put this in the sophomore section but I do understand that it is hard to get a job before you can drive, but you still can.  I mean, I did it and both my parents worked all day, sometimes I had to walk to work before I got my first car.  If I can do it, so can you.  Don't apply to these crazy jobs either that have specific qualifications, and whatever.  Do something normal for a teen; Grocery store, fast food, clothing store, something to get you some spending money.

And most importantly from that last section SAVE YOUR MONEY:  You don't truly understand it until you get older and older how much that saving at least 30% of your weeks paycheck will help you as you get older.  And if you are already working before you have to pay bills and insurance, save almost all of your paychecks, seriously.  I've seen so many people who have worked just as long, and sometimes even longer than I have who have a small fraction saved in the bank compared to mine.  And I'm not saying that you can't spend your check at all, absolutely not, believe me, I go on little spending sprees once and a while, but don't let it become a habit, and don't buy everything that you pick up, it will make you into a monster, just like your mom Karen, see what it's done to her?  The thousands of dollars she's wasted on silverware that sits in the cabinet, never to be touched.  That'll be you if your not WICKED SMAHT with ya money, alright? 

One final note, and this ones big.  Going into junior year, their's probably a bunch of bullshit teachers that are going to push you into taking AP classes.  Now, in some instances, this is a good thing.  If you plan on going to a top tier school, or are a kid who is always involved in school and constantly pushes yourself to do more challenging things, then maybe it is a good thing to take these classes.  BUT, AND I MEAN BUT VERY SERIOUSLY, if you're an average Joe like me, who goes to school at 8:00 a.m and leaves at 2:00 p.m, and goes to work 4 days out of the school week from 5:00-10:00 p.m, and is only interested in state schools DO NOT TAKE AP CLASSES.  Once again, if that person previously listed is you, DO NOT TAKE AP CLASSES.  They are an absolute waste of your time.  First off, if you plan on working, forget it, that shit's pointless, but if you are going to a regular state school, they don't care about AP classes, honestly they don't.  They are such a waste of your time and can seriously hurt your GPA if you don't have the time for it, which in turn will lessen your chances of getting a financial award for having a good GPA.  And especially if you work everyday or almost everyday of the week like myself, you really won't have time for AP classes.  During my senior year of high school I had to juggle around, school, TWO part time jobs, AND landscaping on the side ALL AT ONCE.  Their is no way in hell that I would have had time for some bullshit 10 page nightly homework for AP math.  

&#x200B;

SENIORS

All right, so now you gotta decide whether or not you are going to work or go to school after this year.  My advice, if you have a connection to someone who is in a trade field, like plumbing, electrical, HVAC, etc. AND you enjoy the work yourself, skip out of school and go for your apprenticeship.  Their are so many kids that I went to school with who did that, and just after a short couple of months after graduating, already have stable jobs they love, with livable pay, and some even have their own apartments that they share with their friends.  (They of course had the upper hand by going to a vocational high school of course, if you go to a regular public high school you won't have this easy of an opportunity unless you are related or close to someone in the field.)

If you really don't know what you want to do, I suggest going to a continuing education school, whether that be a vocational school (New England Institute of Technology, for example), or a community college, which is dirt cheap and will in many cases cover your regular academic courses for college, as long as they are connected to the state school you plan on attending.  This is a very smart choice for those who aren't sure where they want to go in life, or for those who simply cannot afford university costs for 4 straight years.

Finally, if you are currently choosing a school that you wish to go to for the next four years, I beg you to be smart about your choice.  First of all, we live in an age where almost every kid goes to school for a bachelor's degree, which means that going to an Ivy league school doesn't always mean jack shit unless you're going for a really specific major that said school you are looking at is most recognized for.  Also, with that said, don't go to school for a bullshit major like ""Eastern Asian Historic Studies"", you will literally be homeless before you graduate if you choose something like that.  If you live near a state school that has good credentials, and is known for sending many of their students off with careers, stick to that.  State schools have excellent professors, and are extremely cheap.

Another thing, I know that it sounds exciting to be able to live on campus for college, and you wish to do that for at least your first year, but if you are attending a state school that's less than an hour commute, don't waste your money.  You can still be extremely active with your school and stay close with your friends even if you commute, you're just going to save way more money than they will.  Believe me, most of the kids that live on campus are broke, while you drive to school, going to your part-time job, and looking like a king while your friends look like your peasants.  Plus, if you're chill enough with your friends, they might even let you crash in their room for a few nights.

I think we were in the same boat and I‚Äôve got to tell you that high school shouldn‚Äôt be about stressing.

We  were both successful and we‚Äôre both heading to good colleges in the fall. 

If you‚Äôre stressed about getting good grades to get into college, don‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm sure you know already but colleges look for many other things besides grades(extracurriculars, leadership opportunities, etc). I for one definitely didn‚Äôt get into college with just my grades. 

I‚Äôd you‚Äôre stressed about getting good grades to prove a point or impress others, don‚Äôt worry about it. It‚Äôs your high school career and not theirs.

All in all you don‚Äôt need to take stress inducing classes to succeed in high school. There are a lot of factors and I find that doing something that you are passionate about like an elective is rewarding as well. Plus it gives you something genuine and unique to write about for college essays. You‚Äôve fought more for grades than I have, you aren‚Äôt a failure in the slightest. ",2020-05-07 01:31:19

gvhafy,Hate my Competitive HS,"tl;dr - I go to a crazy competitive HS and I hate it, even though I'm a good student. 

&#x200B;

Hi All, I am a rising senior who goes to a highly competitive public high school in the Boston Suburbs. We probably send around 15-20 students to the Ivy League each year and maybe another 50 to T-50s. Needless to say, there is a lot of competition. I really hate it all. It seems like everyone (in my honors/AP classes, at least) is a straight-A genius who barely studies and does 10 extracurriculars passionately. If you don't match the top students in terms of AP's taken or grades, you feel pretty badly about yourself and that you are failing even with a 3.9 GPA. Every lunch period seems like a time to bash people who say any concept or test is difficult. Worst of all, the counselors always tell you to have a balance in life even though it seems nobody else has one and is busy 24 hours a day. It always seems as if you aren't constantly busy and at school until 9PM every night you are lazy. Honestly, I just want to get out after senior year and never see the Ivy braggarts again. I wish I went to a worse district where not going to college was common - my perspective on the world is terribly warped due to the competition and I feel like if I don't go to a T-20 I'm a stupid person. Does anybody else have a similar HS **and** **who is not the braggart with a $15,000 tutor?**",highschool,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/gvhafy/hate_my_competitive_hs/,False,,26,"Sophomore, average (mostly) white male from Toronto, aka the most ethnically diverse city in the world. School population is maybe 80% Chinese, Middle eastern and Indian, 15% African Caribbean, and the last 5 is white, which kinda makes me a caucasian minority. This leads us to being one of the best public schools in ontario.

Anyways, due to the overwhelming amount of ethnics at my school, you can also assume that their parents are really strict, meaning everyone is serious and not fucking around when it comes to grades, which also means my school is boring af. I've tried transferring so that I can relax a bit but my parents already refused and now i'm stuck in a competitive school where they hate on white kids and take all classes seriously and we have shitty sports teams. And when I say that I mean all common sports teams such as basketball, track, and soccer, which are the sports I like. Although we do have excellent volleyball, ping pong, badminton, even cricket. Yes, cricket. fucking CRICKET teams. Trust me, I have nothing against ethnics, if anything I like ethnics. However fitting in with them is a whole other realm cuz some of them really hate white kids because they are apparently all entitled and this leads to my issue with lack of friends. Honestly, i've given up on the topic at this point. fml. ",2020-06-03 06:21:37

etr1md,Best way of cheating,"This ones for all of y‚Äôall taking a foreign language class.

So in highschool I took Latin and was pretty decent at it.  However, my lazy ass hated studying and our class gave A LOT of vocabulary to memorize.  However, our tests usually consisted of us translating a single passage that was in the textbook we had.  Normally, it would be impossible to figure out which passage was being used on the test cuz the book has hundreds of passages.

However, our teacher gave us a vocabulary sheet with key words we had to memorize. Big mistake.

Instead of studying vocabulary like any sane person, we would scour the whole book looking for the one passage which contained all the key vocabulary words from the sheet she gave us (they were given in order).  We found the passage every time and walked into the test with it memorized and basically got 100% on every single test.",highschool,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/etr1md/best_way_of_cheating/,False,,10,Not cheating ,2020-01-25 21:55:35

These zip files contain pertinent and various amounts of review books, textbooks, and released exams in PDF format so all of you can study for the AP tests and SAT (no ACT) without having to spend money. For APs, I have gathered the files and FRQ links for the more popular subjects throughout students and high schools. I would also like these zip files to stay exclusively for this subreddit, but I cannot stop you from spreading them.

fes1ok,I Hate Highschool,"I (F 15) had such a bad day today, I just need to rant. I hate highschool so much, and I‚Äôm only a freshman. It‚Äôs dumb. Everybody cares too much. About themselves, and about what others think. And I‚Äôm not going to lie, I do too. I‚Äôm a teenager, how can I not? But it‚Äôs getting to the point where I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôm a girl, so I do what almost every other teenage girl does before school. I straighten my hair, put on makeup, make sure my outfit is cute, etc. But to be honest, I would much rather wear a comfy oversized sweater and sweats. I mean, we‚Äôre at school to learn, right? 

Also, the people. I can‚Äôt stand them. I can‚Äôt even stand my own friends. Yes, I have a good sized friend group, but I only have one or two friends who I genuinely connect with. And even then, I don‚Äôt have a best friend. Somebody who I have tons of inside jokes with. Somebody who I can talk to about anything. I feel so alone. I just want to leave this place already. 

It‚Äôs so hard to focus on your grades when it feels like hundreds of people are judging you. When really, it‚Äôs just yourself. I still manage to maintain good grades. But sometimes, it‚Äôs a lot. And I still have a whole other 3 years here. I‚Äôm already tired of it.

frfz26,Contemplating dropping out," 

Howdy. I am a senior in my last semester of high school. Due to an extremely stressful home life (addicts in the family) and needing to get 2 jobs to support myself and my family I had to transfer from the early college I was at to the alternative school near me (all the schoolwork is online), the only other option was dropping out. The school uses a very dated system called A+LS that shows you a picture of a bus or something saying ""good job"" every time I answer correctly and a lot of the information it tries to teach me is either blatantly biased or oversimplified and it makes me feel like a dunce. The alternative school isn't difficult but it's still very time-consuming and due to coronavirus one of my 2 workplaces is closed so I've had to work more at my other job to make ends meet. The workload for my school hasn't changed and at this point I'm really contemplating dropping out. I'm tired. I mean I understand that getting my GED isn't quite as good as a diploma but I'm really just done with having to come home after work every day and doing school work just to be told I did a good job by some stupid bus.",highschool,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/frfz26/contemplating_dropping_out/,False,,20,"I know I‚Äôm late to the thread, but I‚Äôve had family members drop out of high school.

OP, you are so close to finishing. From someone who‚Äôs seen the outcome and had it affect my personal life, I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy. If you can‚Äôt find a reason to finish, do it for me. Please just push through. You have a month and a half. You made it this far, you can make it 45 more days. Keep up the hard work!

I then had horrible carpal tunnel in grade 11 and had a brace on for a solid month. I had to wear it a few times after that for flare ups.

Now, 3 days into the new year I bent my hand the wrong way at work and had multiple xrays, nothing broken though so idk what‚Äôs wrong with it.

egdje2,Why are so many girls at my high school spoiled about what car they get/have? Is this the case at other people‚Äôs schools?,"I don‚Äôt know if this is just my school, but the guys and girls seem to be opposites with cars. The guys are all grateful for their cars whether they‚Äôre new or old or what they look like. Hell, I drive a 2006 Corolla and I love my car and it warms up super quick too, but the girls seem to be much different than the guys. So many of them make fun of us guys who have older cars as they drive off in their brand new Jeep Wranglers. I also talked to a girl in my school who said she‚Äôs asking for a brand new car for her 17th because ‚Äúher grandparents got her a used Nissan and she hates being seen driving around that piece of sh*t‚Äù. There was also a girl who said she wanted to total the used car her dad got her so he could buy her a brand new car instead. I swear, is this how they are at your schools or are the girls at my school just crazy?",highschool,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/egdje2/why_are_so_many_girls_at_my_high_school_spoiled/,False,,24,"Do you honestly think very single teenage girl in the world is the same? I don't even *own* a car to crash for god's sake. I'm from a pretty affluent community and a lot of kids here do have cars, and nice ones at that (BMWs, Teslas, and the like) but most of them are responsible and grateful for what they have. And my parents will *never* buy me a car or even give me one of their's, even though they have the financial means to do so. So no. Teenage girls are not all the same. Obviously.

You only give anecdotal evidence of *2 girls* who have made these sort of comments. There are probably, at max (based on my knowledge of the average size of a US public high school), a couple thousand other girls attending your school. That is not nearly enough to warrant such a question. 

And there are nearly 4 billion women in this world.  16%, or 640 million, are adolescent girls (according to UNICEF).

Statistically, it is probably *pure chance* that all the spoiled kids you have interacted with are female. Your sample size is minuscule. Let's say, to give you some benefit of the doubt, that *every single girl* at your school (which I am assuming to be around 2000) complains about their car and *all of the guys* don't. Even though you only gave evidence of 2.

That's still only 2000 girls/640 million, which is literally only 0.0003125%. This number is so small that, in stats, it might as well be zero. Like I said, *pure chance* that it is *just* the girls at your school seem so stuck up. They are by no means whatsoever representative of all teenage girls, and your assumption that they could be is ridiculous.

Sorry if I'm being derisive. But you're on reddit. There are a ton of high school girls on here. They are obviously not all like that. You shouldn't have to ask this question. And you have the internet. If you think the whole world is full of spoiled, entitled kids, read the news. ",2019-12-28 00:54:14

Lol here's a tip of what not to do if you actually like her and want to take her on a date one day, I'm a senior girl and in my sophomore I feel like something similar happened to me? haha ofc idk your exact situation but I wanna help

\-go up and start talking with her, it doesn't have to be anything crazy, but actually get to know her over some time, and let her get to know you!! There was this guy in like 2 of my classes sophomore year and I knew he liked me cuz I always caught him staring ,he would always clam up when I talked to him, and I could sense his friends nudging him towards me and whatnot. He was that shy not so popular kind of guy and I actually thought he was pretty cute, and he did have a chance, but didn't do it the right way. 

we walked to our 2 classes together just cuz we had some mutual friends (but I hardly knew who he was before that year) and were going in the same direction, BUT HE NEVER LET ME GET TO KNOW HIM! Every time we talked, he would ask me about how I was doing, if i had tests that day, what classes were stressing me out and other surface level crap, and all I wanted to do was stop being in the spotlight and know more about him! At the end of the year, he asked me on a date and I said no, not because I didn't care about him at all, but I didn't want to give him a pity yes and lead him on. 

He was so nice and sweet, but just seemed like a good friend that cared; even after a whole year of our walks to class, I barely knew him.

I love Derrick. He's a very nice guy. He's quiet and a little socially awkward, but once you get to know him he's really cool.

I like Julian because he's funny, but he can also be an ass. He's an ass to Derrick.

Julian talks crap about Derrick behind his back. He says things like, ""Derrick acts like a punk ass, etc, etc."" I call him out like, ""Why are you talking about Derrick like that?"" Then he goes, ""Oh I didn't mean it like that.""

He disrespects him. One day when we were sitting in class, we got an assignment back. Derrick didn't do so well on it. He told Julian and I what he got and Julian goes, ""Oh wow, you're stupid."" Derrick just sat there. I should've stood up for him, but I didn't. Another time for another assignment, Julian asked him what he got on it. Derrick proceeded to tell him and Julian goes, ""Wow you are terrible.""

I remember me, Derrick, and a couple of our other friends were standing outside the classroom before class started. Julian comes up and gives each one of us dap. When he comes to Derrick, he was about to give him some dap, and Derrick was to, then Julian just disses him and waved his hand off at him.

One day when the three of us were on our way to lunch, Julian once again was teasing Derrick, and Derrick told him, ""Shut up Julian!"" Julian fired back and told him, ""Shut your faggot ass up!"" I started laughing but then I grabbed Derrick in a bro friendly kind of way and told Julian, ""Don't come at my man's Derrick like that!"" Then Julian goes, ""I was just playing with him. You're getting so serious.""

He didn't sound like he was playing.

I don't like how Julian treats Derrick. I'm not really sure how I should come up to Julian about it.

dyqp3t,I've never studied in my life. Is it too late now?,"Ok, so, I'm gonna try to tell you my story really quick. When I entered 1st grade, I had family problems so I didn't start off school with the right foot from an early age. I continued to never do my homework or study all throughout elementary and middle school. Whenever I tried to study, the teachers wouldn't even notice because they hated me (I talk a lot in class and I suspect I have ADHD, because I have all the symptoms) so it really crushed my self esteem and I‚Äôm still sure I‚Äôm dumb. Now after 9th grade I entered High School. I was supposed to study but idk what happened... I had no motivation to do anything. After being called dumb by everyone in my life I felt like it wasn't worth it because my work wouldn't pay off anyway. Now I‚Äôm finishing the first semester of my second year, and let's just say it hasn't been going well, and I only have the next year left. Now, one of the reasons I was never motivated was also because I didn't plan to go to uni after hs, but now I've realised that I wanna do something with myself but I also feel like it's too late, but for the uni I want to go to I need a 8.5 and up grade average, and my last years grade average was 6. I‚Äôve fallen behind on so much, idk how i‚Äôll get on track with subjects like math, chemistry and science when I've missed out on the basics. Should I try to get to uni, or is it too late. I need to choose now what I'm gonna do with my life.

enswfl,i‚Äôve lost all my friends,"i am a 15 year old girl. i‚Äôm fairly popular and i used to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with all the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù kids in my year level for a good couple of months. i had about 7 close friends and now it‚Äôs down to 3. 
basically, i became pretty popular last year and there was this boy let‚Äôs call him jacob. jacob has been bullying me since year 8, telling me everyday how i‚Äôm flat for no reason at all i had done nothing to him. then year 9 came and we became friends for like a month and then the day before school started he turned on me. i was friends with the popular girls but they started to become really rude to me so i ended my friendship with all of them.
everyday at school jacob calls me a disease and if he sees me hanging out with my friends he makes fun of them for hanging out with me.
he turned the whole year level against me!
now my best friend let‚Äôs say his name is chris, lives down my street so i see him basically everyday and have become friends with his friends but not close enough to just ask them to see me one day. 
i had this other best friend tim, who turned on me aswell one day and talked a lot of shit about me, and last night we had a fight because i posted a video of me and my friends listening to a song and he posted on his story saying ‚Äúwhen someone ruins such a good song for you‚Äù and i had enough and was like what is your problem.
now last night i was at chris‚Äôs house with all his girl-friends (chris is gay) and was meant to be home at 10:45 pm, but i decided to stay longer and ended up coming home at 1am and my mum woke up cause she heard me sneaking in. now i‚Äôm pretty sure they will ban me from seeing chris (which they have done before) so i basically have no friends left.
i‚Äôve asked to move schools but there are no schools i can attend since i‚Äôm not in the zone and my mum doesn‚Äôt take me seriously when i ask, she thinks it‚Äôs a joke.

e7u2y6,Why my best friend had to leave my school.,"Apologies for bad format I‚Äôm on mobile.

I am now in the 11th grade and things aren‚Äôt really as bad as before. The worst that happens now is just people growing apart and classes getting harder.

Grade 9 however was like the epitome of hell. School ruined me to be honest but that‚Äôs a story for an other time. I started out a really outgoing and excitable kid but turned much quieter and more shy in nature, this incident is actually one of the reasons why. 

My best friend used to be known for being ‚Äúthat kid‚Äù. The girl who always started things and wanted to fight other people all the time, things like that. Luckily enough she actually changed her behavior ( for herself ) and turned into a really great person. 

At the time this story takes place is actually in the middle of the last fight we‚Äôd ever had and we both decided we where not friends anymore. To make a long story short, she stole my boyfriend and it wasn‚Äôt very pretty. Anyways, as she was dating him a soft spoken usually known to be nice girl began going around and saying that my friend told her to kill herself. 

My ex boyfriend even told me about it as we where fighting about him leaving me for her because of.. gross.. reasons. Somehow, even though I was mad at her. I knew she didn‚Äôt do it. To be fair at the time she was mean but.. Suicide hits close to home with her and even speaking about the topic at all sends her to tears. I knew something was up so I ended up messaging the girl. (Me:me g:the girl) (this conversation may not be completely. Correct word for word but it‚Äôs what I remember happening)

Me: hey, I heard from some people that BF(best friend) told you to kill yourself, is that true..?

G: yeah it is.

Me: well.. do you have any proof.

G: yeah I have proof.

Me: okay well show me.

G: you have no idea how mean she was to me.. I didn‚Äôt even do anything but she just started yelling at me and telling me to kill myself.. and I cried myself to sleep after.

Me: honestly, G, I don‚Äôt care about your feelings right now I just want the proof.

G:oh..

Me: what?

G: I don‚Äôt have it..

Me: then why did you just lie to me 2 minutes ago that you did have proof, huh? Unless you‚Äôve been lying about this whole thing to get attention. 

G: You‚Äôre a b*tch.

Well.. after that conversation she blocked me from everything and I knew she was lying. I have a pretty good idea why to. She was quiet and wasn‚Äôt known for getting a lot of attention, good or bad. She was kind of known for just being there. I think she just wanted the spot light for once and used my friend for bait because she knew everyone would turn on her without a second thought. As well as she actually did call me a b*tch and I was pretty mad about that.

Even though my best friend and I weren‚Äôt friends then I still stood up for her. The ex ended up leaving her too and we realized that argument was ridiculous and we both moved on. 

The girl though did not stop. She continued saying it and turning people on my friend and that resulted in them turning on me. After I went home one day my friend calls me and tells me she saw the girl at the park and decided to confront her on her lies. She asked her about times and proof and even showed everyone around them all the messages they had together ( where my friend had been nothing but nice to her ) and people finally questioned her. The girl slapped her. Right in the face. At this point my friend was absolutely livid and kneed her right in the face. 

The police where called and the girls dad came to pick his daughter up, screaming lies at my friend that she‚Äôd been bullying his daughter for years and that he was gonna bash my friends face in. Luckily everyone around got every word he said on film.

Court day came and despite my friend having all the proof in the world and that girl had nothing but made up sob stories she won. She won the case and got a restraining order on my friend which meant she had to move away.

Well after that the girl tried turning people, including teachers, on me despite us not talking for a year after that incident and me not being one for confrontation. Eventually though she lost all her friends and had a horrible reputation and was forced to move away. My best friend is coming back next semester and is gonna make a grand entrance. Honestly the best kind of revenge. I always say karma does it‚Äôs best work alone.

d10hkl,My friend blames me for calling the suicide hotline on her,"Recently, I called the suicide hotline on one of my friends Jessica. The problem is that I asked advice from one of my close friends on what should I do. He told me to call the hotline on her because Jessica recently cut herself, and I was scared as hell to lose a friend in high school. To me, I did not want to remember Jessica as the friend who I could've saved in high school but she died due to my inaction. Anyways, he told me to call the hotline instead of the police because I was initially going to call the cops on her (that would be very stupid of call the cops).

So, I called the hotline on her, and they gave me tips on how to calm my friend down and be a good friend for her. Basically, the hotline just told me tips on how to ease her situation without sounding selfish. However, my friend ended up telling my friend Jessica, which was against my wishes. I told my friend not to tell Jessica because this is highly serious.

Her reaction was awful. I was just casually sitting alone in the school library, minding my own business. Then, she comes up to me and starts to scold me for calling the hotline on her without telling her first. Her reasons was that she wanted to keep this information between me and her privately. Also, she said if I were to call the hotline I should've asked her first. Then, she left the library, and I chased after her, which was wrong because I made a scene in the school library.

Now, I don't know how to apologize. Am I the asshole? First, I told my ""friend"" that he is an asshole for telling her. However, he said that he doesn't have anything against me but calling a hotline on someone is damn serious and that she has the right to know about it.  However, the worst part is Jessica says she doesn't want to talk to me until she calms down.

g7jple,Complicated friendship with my teacher,"Before I start, we are both the same gender(females) so nothing weird here. She first taught me in grade 10. We got really close and on the last day of classes she asked me to find things to do together in the summer. We stayed in touch and went to the movies once. In grade 11 I wasn‚Äôt in her class but I visited her in break every once in a while & we went out a couple of times. In the summer, she went radio silence unless I texted.
In grade 12, I was back in her class. It was awkward for me because I thought of her more as friend. On her birthday that year, I arranged a surprise party for her with the class and got her a small gift with a note telling how how I loved her despite us growing apart. She responded by promising me never to grow apart, that she will always be there and that she loved me like her own kids, very close friends & sister. We had lunch afterwards and she said she‚Äôd like that we do this more often. She would always check on me by texting or calling. 

However, by mid-year I was the only one initiating conversations and it really hurt me. I expressed how I felt to her (maybe not in the best way possible) through a long message, she said she felt lost & confused and was really sorry I felt the way. And that she does truly love me and care about it. She said that love and hurt don‚Äôt go together and it seemed that she genuinely felt sorry. I waited for her to say or do anything for the following 2 weeks but nothing... she continued to treat me like a stranger at school. 

I was really hurt and couldn‚Äôt take it so I sent her another message telling her I wished we talked things out but i won‚Äôt disturb her if that‚Äôs what she wants. She told me we could meet up in an hour to talk. We met and she said she never got into such a ‚Äòfight‚Äô ever before and that she won‚Äôt take any more accusations. We cleared some misunderstandings on both sides. And she told me that I expected too much from her and that it‚Äôs best not to expect anything from anyone to avoid misunderstandings. She told me to ask her anything at the time and she won‚Äôt take any of my inquiries again. I asked her if she was okay with us being that close and she said I was impossible and that of course and relationships just happen. But I still felt distant and unfortunately hurt. So I tried to lower my expectations cause I feel like I‚Äôm just another student to her and she means more to me than I do to her.

Covid19 came and I didn‚Äôt think we would talk but surprisingly she texted to check on me and has been nicer to me. However, I don‚Äôt want to get attached to her and get hurt again cause it still hurts tbh and I don‚Äôt think I can take it anymore. Also, a week ago she was having a problem with my class and asked me to help and I was there for her and she she thanked me for it and said she loved me and referred to me as her daughter and it really hurt. I don‚Äôt want to get attached to her and I‚Äôm not completely over her either. So, what do you think? Is it possible that she loves me? Should I keep distance?

anj44k,This is something very important that everyone should read,"EDIT: It turns out that he did not bring the gun to my school. That part was just a rumor. However, he still made the threat using a picture of a gun on Snapchat and was still arrested. Idk why but he was released later that afternoon after I had already made this post. Also, he dropped out of my school last year.

So today, someone brought a gun to my school. He posted a picture of it to Snapchat at around 10:40 saying he was going to shoot up the school. He was arrested behind the school. Some people say that he is a junior, some say that he doesn‚Äôt even go to my school, some say that he once brought a knife with him in middle school, etc. I only heard this from other people so I don‚Äôt know how much of this is true or how much is just rumors, but I do know that someone came to school threatening to hurt a lot of people, and that is very scary. Whether or not he meant what he said, I have no idea. However, I am thankful that nothing bad happened. This could have turned out so, so bad. If nobody said anything about it, I don‚Äôt know if I would be sitting on my couch right now typing all of this out.

I said all of that to say this: IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING! I cannot stress this enough. If someone didn‚Äôt speak up, people could have died today. This concept does not apply to only potential shootings, it also applies to anything that tells you that someone might be intending to harm someone else or already is. You should also speak up if you believe someone is planning to harm themselves. If you have any reason to believe that someone is going to hurt others or themselves, SPEAK UP! Call the police, tell a parent, tell a teacher/boss/coworker, or anyone! You can be the deciding factor between life and death for someone.

* If I were to get B's sometimes (in freshman year), would it matter much in the future to colleges and GPA?
* What are some things I can do during 9th grade that would be worth it in the future for me?
* If I'm struggling in middle school (my grades aren't bad but it's not great either, and I have bad anxiety that makes me struggle with sleep, procrastination, etc.) should I get a tutor?
* For those who improved their grades, what exactly did you change in your life? Did you get tutoring, change your mindset, join a study group?
* Does anyone have any general tip? (academically, socially etc.)
* What should I do during 9th grade that would impress colleges/teachers?

This is my first year in highschool and I really want to find some friends and to have a good a time :)  What was the way you got over the anxiety and how did you make your friends? Can you give me some advices please, I am very nervous

Edit: thank you all for your comments and advices ü•∞",highschool,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/cdjyo0/first_year_of_highschool/,False,,34,"Be nice to teachers, pay attention, and don't be afraid to ask questions. I'm a rising junior, I was super anxious my freshman year. I found that the best way to do good in high school is to find enjoyment in it. At least in my school the people who hate it the most do the worst. When you enjoy something you are more likely to remember stuff about it. I ended up getting 101% in biology my freshman year because I found a way to enjoy it (Nice teacher help too). 

I don't know about all school but high school teachers seem a bit more chill to me. As you start getting in higher grades the teachers get calmer. In my 2nd year, I took a college-level history class and we would watch old musical/movies and most class periods were lecture based. We didn't do any worksheets or stuff like that. 

Don't be afraid of your grade. Your first years depending on classes your GPA may seem low. It's always the lowest those years because of the basic classes you take. 

Take notes, your teachers may not ""underline"" what could be on a quiz. Anything and everything could be put onto a test. Even if they repeat themselves writing it down will help you remember. 

Keep old tests, quizzes, and notes. You may need them for corrections if your teacher does that. Plus they will be super useful for testing/finals.

For math keep a piece of paper with every formula your teacher tells you. Do not throw it away, laminate it. It will be gold.

Do not make enemies. I made one, then she got busted by her parents for smoking weed and sent to London.

Use binders. They allow you to be better organized. Teachers love an organized student plus it will help in general. You can add new paper and take away ones that aren't needed.

Take new classes. Depending on the school you may have optional classes. Mine had a college theater and I loved it. You need to take a variety to graduate and it can be fun.

Community service looks good at colleges. If your school has community service events or trackers (to track hours) do it.

Don't be the kid that comes in late every day

Don't talk back to teachers 

Let me know if you have any questions? ",2019-07-16 00:54:09

If their work is completed and they understand the material why should it matter that they‚Äôve been sick for more than 10 days throughout the whole year. Obviously if schools didn‚Äôt make any attendance policy kids would abuse it, I understand that. But attendance shouldn‚Äôt be so strictly enforced. For some reason this year I‚Äôve been getting sick almost every other month causing me to miss quite a few days of school. Even with all that happening I made up my work and caught up. The school finds this an issue and feels the need to mail my mom a letter detailing my absences and this just annoys her because every time I‚Äôm absent she‚Äôll call AND write a note (she says leaving a paper trail is important). And I know this sounds crazy but life happens sometimes things like funerals unexpected happenings ,friends, and family are possible reasons a person might not be able to attend school and miss a few days . I won‚Äôt lie a few of my absences are for family reasons(that are none of the schools business) and somehow because I have I life outside of school ,I‚Äôm put on the attendance watch list. Even better my teacher felt the need to tell me this out loud in class so all my peers can hear. it‚Äôs none of their business.Yes there are cases of poor parenting and bad behavior where the schools send letters and warnings in order to help the student improve.

ezk0c2,chemistry sucks,"Hey guys. So I‚Äôve been in honors chemistry my entire sophomore year. I don‚Äôt know why but for some reason, I just can‚Äôt do it. 

Hear me out. I go to tutoring every single week. I‚Äôve spent time everyday, actually studying, going over practice problems, looking on YouTube, getting my own personal tutor, talking to the teacher, asking my classmates yet I still bomb EVERY SINGLE TEST. I‚Äôve never tried harder in my entire life. 

Our teacher uses a YouTube video and 5 minute lecture teaching style and gives us homework everyday. The homework is manageable but when it comes down to tests, I‚Äôll take one look at the paper and be completely lost. Or I‚Äôll think I understood the homework but run out of time to actually finish my test. 

My motivation to study is plummeting. Even though I‚Äôll spend hours trying to master our concepts over weekends and spend at least an hour & a half everyday with chemistry homework, I can never be as smart as my classmates are. I‚Äôm so tired of bothering everyone and asking them for help. I even have my own tutor yet with my test scores, you couldn‚Äôt even tell. I‚Äôm genuinely scared I‚Äôll fail this semester of chemistry and at this point I don‚Äôt even know what to do. 

I can barely get myself to study for the makeup test tomorrow and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve tried so hard yet constantly failed so why bother studying anymore. I‚Äôll raise my hand in class and ask questions but nothing seems to help.

eg1xps,Grades as a Determining Factor,I‚Äôm currently a Sophomore in high school and I always constantly dread when I don‚Äôt get an A or even the thought of getting a low A. I have never had to live the reality of getting anything but an A until today when my grade in AP Seminar dropped to a B. It stressed me out a lot and I‚Äôm not sure why. I always tell people that grades do not define them as a person yet for some reason I can‚Äôt swallow that myself. People at my school are always so keen on being competitive. I don‚Äôt know why grades are such a big factor. I started to feel what others felt after my grade dropped because I realized I put in so much effort into my work and underperformed by a lot.,highschool,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/eg1xps/grades_as_a_determining_factor/,False,,6,"Used to look through this subreddit a lot, but now I'm just a lurker since I graduated already. In high school, I used to be the same because everybody in the area was brought up the similarly (parents would use grades as validation), and it just created a super stressful and semi-toxic environment. In hindsight, college has treated me better in a number of ways, including mentally and relationship wise. It's hard in the moment, but I found that as I transitioned into college life, grades have definitely taken the backseat with internships and extracurriculars being more important. Plus good habits from high school translate into good habits in college most of the time, so I'm pretty grateful for knowing good ways to study. Just remember to let yourself breathe!

cryye2,I'm going to high school as a freshman being super freaked out about it and need some help,"My old school was very small and everyone knew everyone else, (I probably knew 50% of everyone there) and now I'm gonna go to a much larger high school than my middle school and I'm worried. I have to miss the first week because I'm travelling to space camp, but I'm not to worried about missing the first week because everything will probably be very easy that first week. what I'm more worried about is PE. I'm not a very athletic person and struggle with doing simple exercises and My old school was pretty relaxed about PE as long as you wore shorts or sweatpants basic athletic stuff and no flip flops or other non-fitness shoes then you were good. I never changed in the locker room, because I am very shy person (plus I could pretty much always get away with it) and I feel like I made a mistake because I have no clue what to do.

6r90ig,Finally caught up with kid i bullied in HighSchool,"I hung with a very messed up group of people growing up. There was this kid ""Johnathan"" and we tore him up everyday to pass the time in boring school. Nothing physical just verbal abuse. Sarcastic responses. Getting hot girls to ask him out then ghost him.

Anyways, i saw him 5 years after high-school and i went thru drug addiction & now recovery so i changed a whole lot. I saw him in line at a movie & began to make amends to him. I came really close to getting misty eyed. After my 100 words or so he responded with silence. And he said, ""are you messing with me again?"" i said ""no"".
And he then went on to tell me that his perception was very very very very different. He saw us as frends. He literally thought that's just how our group acted with friends. And he perceived all those girls we set him up with as a favor we did for him. And that the girls were assholes for ghosting him.

I realize now that even though he was delusional, that delusion kept his ego safe. He's now a very successful business owner. We had no impact on his life, other than giving him the opinion that addicts are weird friends. I also learned that i shouldn't judge religious people so much for being a tad delusional. Their delusion makes them happy & safe. Plus my perception of their beliefs doesn't affect their beliefs. Anyways.

elvxcf,The pressure is TOO much!,"Yesterday I stayed up ALL night trying to do this English assignment and when the morning came I felt so stressed. I am one of those people who have an extreme hatred for school and I CHERISH the moments in which I can do nothing and just be! Yesterday was a shit show cause I worked from 4pm to 5:30am in the morning. What makes things worse is that I was already running on 5 hours of sleep from the night b4 so I was feeling extremely drained. It would have all been worth it if I finished the assignment and handed it in today but guess what, even with staying up the entire night I still wasn‚Äôt CLOSE to finishing. I came into school and I finally thought I had my entire project done until some girl in my class alerted me that several parts of my assignment was missing. I checked the syllabus for the project and this info wasn‚Äôt their but then a small memory came back to me of the teacher asking for a specific piece of the assignment. With the way this English assignment was structured all I had to do was print out my source material but it would take me at least 20 minutes to get all the papers sorted back into order and stapled and I had class in literally 30 seconds. To cut my rant short I contemplated skipping class for the first time in my life or faking an injury at the nurse. I even thought about going to the guidance counselor and just freaking CRYING! Somehow i just sucked it up and walked into my class. Also throughout my teachers convo during class I realized that I have to do 70% of my whole assignment over again so this whole thing was for nothing. I feel so stressed and I literally did zero of my other homework last night just so I could finish this one.

He looked at me and said ""Why did you do that for?"" I said ""Because I thought it was funny."" We tried to clean the ceiling pieces up by using a boxing glove but it fell and made more mess and he said ""What made you this was a good idea?"" I told him ""I don't know"" I started to blow the ceiling particles off the floor and made some luck to cleaning it. Then he said ""Put the pieces up the hole and we'll get out"" I laughed and we proceeded to do so and then once the pieces were up there we walked out without anyone even seeing us go out and we both agreed to not say anything about this to anyone.

dp64nc,Dear High School,"*Thank you*, high school, for being the greatest four years ever, and sadly the fastest. 

It feels like yesterday I was just entering the high school as a freshman asking teachers where classrooms were, making sure I wasn‚Äôt tardy, and hoping to see at least one of my friends in one of my classes.

People say high school is the best four years of your life, and I agree with this *a lot*.

If it wasn‚Äôt for high school I would‚Äôve never realized how cool going to dances were and getting involved with the whole crowd of people dancing, or how fun going to Friday night football games were cheering on your team while sitting in the student section, and meeting new people and being friends with the upper class men. 

Talking about meeting new people, I played for the soccer team and it is one of the best decisions I ever made. Not only was it a team but it is also a **bond**. Meeting new people and establishing a relationship is so pure, 

that bond can *never* be broken, even after high school.

Some people don‚Äôt realize that their time is limited. High school is where you are supposed to try new things and see what you like because it‚Äôs going to get more difficult afterwards.

It is crazy to think after you graduate you may never see some of your classmates again, or for a while, just the certain friend group that you have.

Taking advantage of spirit week to dress up all silly and funny because no one will judge you because they‚Äôre doing the same thing.

Realizing your bully means nothing to you and why you shouldn‚Äôt let that bother you, those four years go by way too fast to be worrying about the little things.

Also, do not take the moments with your friends for granted.

Therefore‚Ä¶

Taking group photos and videos of you and your friends at events and save them, because those memories will be there forever.

Look back at the memories and allow yourself to smile.

Because those are four years you won‚Äôt get back.

bxsgzm,Sick during finals,"I'm a sophomore in highschool and on my last day of finals. Yesterday I had my 3rd period final (Paiute, a dying native American language in my area) and 4th period (chemistry). I got home and started to feel that unbearable tired that makes you go and lay down because you cant function. I fell asleep, and woke up 5 hours later with the flu. Headache, sore throat, cold achyness and just alround feeling crappy as shit. I took 4 tylenol (the limit is 6 in 24 hours) and ate some ricearoni with some water and cheese. After that I was ok enough to function and be ""normal"". It is currently 2:12am and I cant sleep. When I do, it's broken sleep and I wake up in pain so bad I'm crying. I'm currently trying to not fall asleep again even though I know I need it to heal. Today, being the last day of finals, I'm still going to go. But in prepared. I'm bringing my 40oz hyrdoflask with cold water, cough drops, a pillow and blanket and asking if I can sit as far away as possible from my peers. I have 5th period (world history) and 6th period (film and arts). My 6th period final is watching a movie I've already seen and grew up watching and answering questions on it. The questions are simple things like: Why would the director choose to use the birdseye view whilst panning from right to left? Or why would the director choose to go from a medium shot to an extreme close up? Or anything along those lines. Simple. I'll just ask to take it immediately and ask if I can sleep on the floor. Because my finals are 2 hours long I'll get a good 1hr and 30 minutes of sleep or at least an hour. I'm gonna be waking up soon, (5:45) and I'll take 2 tylenol and eat some rice, cheese and a banana with water like my nutrition break.

dh3rxs,I did a thing...,"Tbh I doubt anyone will actually read this but here goes...

So as many high school students know, most schools do an absolute crap job of helping when it comes to mental health issues. Because I was really triggered over some of the stuff they were telling us about how to manage our stress, I did a thing and wrote an editorial on some of the issues I had with how they addressed mental health issues and students' stress levels and sent it to the principal, vice principals, and superintendent. 

I got a response from the principal begging me (his words, not mine) to tell him who I was so that we could discuss my perspective (it's not unique, Jeff, it's the same perspective shared by all of your two-thousand-some students) and connect me with a mental health professional if I so desired (again, Jeff's words, not mine). There's stuff I said that I probably shouldn't have, and stuff I didn't say that I probably should have. 

So I'm not totally sure why I felt the need to post this, but whatever I guess, here it is for anyone who's interested.

I'll put a link to the editorial, but there's a couple things to note first

\-So I mention this thing they call ""connections"". They randomly assign each student to a teacher, and we're stuck in these groups for our entire high school career. You can't request to switch classes or anything. Every Wednesday, the schedule changes so that we go to our connections class for thirty minutes and are force fed some bullcrap about mental health, bullying, and other stuff. I do believe that they had good intentions in implementing this program, but it's done much more harm than it has good

\-Potential triggers surrounding suicide/self-harm. If you're sensitive to these and still want to read, please be careful, just in case!

\-Finally, I'm not that great of a writer, so please don't be expecting some sort of masterpiece. This was a long-winded rage-fueled rant that was slammed out on my laptop around 11:30pm, and my only goal was to share a message with my school's administration, not to create some wonder of English literature.

Like, extremely overweight, messed up skin, crooked dirty teeth, and she would always come in with junk food. I was always quite nice to her because I always thought that maybe she just had it hard and struggled with health or finances or something, idk. Anyways, one day we were reading in class and my friend and I were at the back table. We always sat at the back table, but the substitute didn't want us to. She got mad and said ""You two need to sit at the desks."" So we did. We realized that my friend left her notebook at the table so she went back to get it, fell, hit her head on the edge of the table, and didn't freaking get up. So I yelled ""Oh my god, are you okay?!"" and she got up and said she was fine. The sub didn't care that she had just hurt herself and instead yelled at me for being loud. Later that day I got a notification from the school saying that I had been ""written up"" (this was a form of punishment in my school). And that I had also been marked absent for that day. I had to go in and talk to the principle who said he would clear it because I've never disrupted class before and it seemed unlikely I would randomly start. The next day I went in to apologize to the sub and she ignored me. Just flat out ignored me. I had her again like a week later for a different class.

au9shh,How do you manage to prepare for each school day?," 

I don't know if something like this exists, but I got a school phobia. Basically I spend every day except the Saturday, worrying about school, checking out how much time I got left before I will have to go to sleep. This causes me to have trouble falling asleep, basically making me very nervous all the time.

The same problem persists while in school. I keep worrying about every single class during breaks, so I just keep studying whenever I got free time, without relaxing. Other kids don't seem to be having so much trouble with this, and this has driven me to conclusion that I'm not properly prepared every school day.

So my question is, how do you manage to prepare for each school day, and relax in your free time at the same time?

I got lots of free time on my hands since I have no hobbies or after school activities, yet I fail to relax.

emqn98,I feel like I'm having a mental breakdown,"Highschool is hard. 

There's no doubt about it. Everyone knows it. We've all suffered from rath of high school. 

But this year, Grade 11, has done a number on me. 

I'm taking 3 classes, English, Biology and Anthro/Sociology/Psychology. All at the University level. My marks in all but biology are great and no concern to me. However my biology mark is a level 1 (so around a 53?) and I've never been so stressed. I try hard, I listen (as much as possible this teacher is the worst and everything drags on), I take notes, I read the textbook, I do all the homework. I do everything. The homework is \*mostly\* right. theres a few questions I dont understand or get right but thats human nature. However, the quizzes and tests I struggle with and they bring my marks down. 

Anyway, I just got back from Christmas break this week and our teachers are already on us about exams and preparing. I attend an Ontario high school so we are having strikes, which makes attending school harder seeing as we don't know if we'll get a full 3 weeks before exams (rumour has it that there will be a multi day strike RIGHT before exams). 

My biology teacher has given way too much homework. We've been given the following: a textbook chapter to do questions on, an essay, diagrams to label and answer questions about, exam questions, and over 300 words we have to study for the exam.

Today (Friday) and the beginning of next week we will be given more textbook questions, more diagrams, a text review and then we will have a test. 

In addition I have 4 projects for English and a project in my anthropology class worth 15% of my over all grade. 

Most of this is due Monday or Tuesday. 

I'm so tired, I cannot think properly, I cannot say awake. I have trouble forming sentences because of how tired I am. my body is over run. I'm not the kind of student who will stay up and finish all their homework even if its until 5 in the morning. I will gladly put down the pencil and paper, and go to bed at a decent hour so I can try and get some sleep. I make sure I get a good 6-7 hours. But my body still feels horrible.  It just feels like crap.

I need help. I dont know what to do. I'm so tired and stressed. I wanted to go and spend time with my grandma and mom this weekend but it looks like I cant with the amount of work I have. This amount is too much, way too much. it stresses the hell out of me. I think this is going to lead to me snapping and losing it.

I dont know what to do.",highschool,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/emqn98/i_feel_like_im_having_a_mental_breakdown/,False,,11,"I think there‚Äôs a lot of students who feel like this as well. You kind of just have this overwhelming exhaustion over you no matter how much rest you get. Your brain is just that tired. You are just THAT drained from everything. You are so so stressed. I think you need to think about your body first. 

Are you eating enough? Are you eating right? Are you drinking enough? Maybe try to get 8-9 hours of sleep instead. 

Do you have a stress reliever? Writing short stories, drawing, working out..? Try to find time to do something that reduces stress. 

Another tip... use some free time to do some work. At lunch, try to get half an assignment done. While eating dinner, finish the rest of the assignment. Try to get showering and cleaning out of the way and then cram all your homework. Try not to get distracted. Maybe ask your biology teacher for more help since you‚Äôre struggling, or maybe get in touch with a tutor. 

Next year, or whatever comes next, don‚Äôt take as hard of classes. You need a lighter load, as much as you may want to challenge yourself.... you can truly only handle so much. Idk how ur managing a job if u have one...

xutgl,Good Luck in the 2012-2013 School year!,"Hard to believe I and other redditors of the class of 2012 won't be going to high school anymore. Here's some quick advice for the year!

Seniors! Work hard and finish strong! You Keep an eyeout for college deadlines since by now you should know what college you want to attend. And for lords sake, Do your homework and don't get behind. Don't you want to graduate? 

Juniors! Be sure your taking the right classes you need to graduate. You don't want to wait till Senior year to find out you need a certain credit. Study for the SAT/ACT! And don't forget about the PSAT. This is the time to begin the college search.

Sophomores! Congrats on surviving freshmen year. It's not so bad now huh? You should of got the hang of things. This may be the time to begin taking honor classes and challenging yourself. Join some clubs if you haven't. This is the time to figure out what interest you.

Freshman! Welcome to High School! Your probably a bit nervous, but be sure to attend your freshman orientation and practice looking for your classes and getting there on time. It's not like middle school. Some schools have transition camps where you meet new students and get the hang of high school. Other schools have freshman academy's where your all group together for your core classes. Yes, your freshman year does count so do your homework and start getting the idea of what you want to do in the future. Don't worry too much about the SAT or colleges right now, just enjoy growing up. Please don't be a nuisance and crowd the halls. Don't get involved with seniors either, not to be nasty, but they like them fresh.

I will be hanging around remembering my high school days and giving advice to those in high school. Don't be afraid to ask for help!

Have a amazing day,,highschool,33,https://youtu.be/3hboNYg0ag0,False,,31,"I get the concept and vibe that you're trying to create completely but I have some criticism. You have a great voice which would sound amazing live, but I really think a tiny bit of autotune would help in this song, because..Idk how to describe it but it makes perfect sense in my head. Like not much, a tiny amount. Something Adele would use. 

Also for the rap, when you rap quickly, can you try slowing down the beat and rapping on the slowed down beat and speeding it up? Just so everything is *perfectly* on beat. People don't notice these things live but things like this can take away from the vibe of the studio song. 

Could you also increase the volume of the adventure time scene? Not enough for it to completely overshadow the beat but enough so that people don't have to strain to hear what Finn is saying, because I had trouble with that.

Could you also add repeats and mindless singing nonsense in the beginning at a low volume with reverb to add to the slow, sad(ish) effect you're going for in 0:38-1:00?

Some adlibs would be nice in the chorus ""I don't wanna fall for you etc"". In general I think this song could be better with adlibs because what adlibs do is that it takes the boringness away from repitition and you repeat a lot of the same tune ->""I don't wanna fall for you no more no more"" sounds like ""I don't to fall with you"" and you repeat that chorus throughout the song and you say stuff like ""yeah yeah"" and ""oh wow"". At a point it gets boring, like obviously the consumer isn't going to be like ""wow this tune is getting boring"" but that is what they'll be thinking subconsciously.

I believe *a bit* of autotune would help a lot when you start singing in 2:50 to add in the *slightly* futuristic vibe of the beat. Just enough for the autotune not to be noticeable on the first listen. The same way the listeners' first opinion on the beat wouldn't be ""futuristic"", but it's there - inside their subconsciousness.

I like everything else about this song. I know close to nothing about mixing and mastering so I might not know what the fuck I'm talking about but I think you should try these stuff. You said you wanted criticism so there you go. ",2019-07-28 10:08:33

akg3qm,I need girl advice,"I (17 m) am in high school and have a crush on a girl. I've liked her for years but this is the first year we really started talking. The problem is, she is really popular and I am not. We only have two classes together and talk a bit in those classes, but, her best friend is also in those classes. I know she talks to a bunch of other guys but she isn't in a relationship. I also miss out on talking to her at parties/out of school functions because I don't get invited/don't want to go. I have her number from a group project and sometimes text her about class or homework but don't know how to further the conversation without being awkward. I also would never just flat out ask her on a date because I don't have the balls. I'm not the hottest guy but I'm not unattractive (I work out 4 times a week).

duij8s,College anxiety,"I know this isn‚Äôt the most appropriate forum for this to go on, but this is more of just a high school issue, and hopefully other high schoolers or anyone on this forum can relate and provide some guidance. 

So, I applied to this school Early Decision, and I did the whole thing: researched it like I was going to write a thesis on it, toured it, talked to people, and basically I fell in love with it. I loved everything about it, even if it wasn‚Äôt the best school in some areas. Just overall, it has first rate academics, first rate dorms, first rate students and job opportunities and everything. For the past year, all I have wanted and aspired for has been to attend this university.

But recently (I submitted my early decision app a few weeks ago) I have been questioning how great this institution is, if I had sold myself short, and if it was the best for me and if I really could see myself there. I KNOW I belong there and the stats and rankings and all this other BS are what I have always wanted in a school, yet I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about my decision. It‚Äôs like cold feet with marriage, but with college. I can‚Äôt tell if this is happening because I‚Äôm so anxious for the decision day, accompanied with the stress I get from school, my parents, and myself, and this is my subconscious mind finding a way to release this anxiety in a new form or if I made a mistake applying early and should withdraw my application. 


I hope there are others who have been in this situation and could provide some guidance on what to possibly do.

d1e85a,I need your help!,"My wife is getting deployed overseas. She will miss most of our oldest childs sporting events. He will be a Senior in high school. This is her 3rd deployment overseas, and in the past, I have always used facebook live. The problem is that Facebook live is now super buggy. I was live streaming a football game last Friday, and it disappeared.  Unfortunately, it was one of the best games my son has had. 10 tackles, 1 sack, a fumble recovery, and an interception that he returned for a touchdown. The video disappearing left a bad taste in my mouth as far as facebook live is concerned. The problem is that in order to be able to livestream from mobile on YouTube,  you have to have 1,000 subscribers. Look folks, I don't care if you never even watch the channel, I just want to be able to livestream my childrens accomplishments with my wife while she is deployed overseas. If you do watch, be prepared to watch some exciting Football/Basketball/Softball/Baseball at the high school level. Our football team went to the state playoffs last year. This last friday, they had already scored 44 points in the first half before the game was called due to lightning and thunder. Over 475 yards Offensively, and a defensive touchdown and a safety contributed to that score. This is a small school in Eastern Oregon, and they are playing 8man football. If you want to watch some fast paced action, subscribe. If you don't,  then please subscribe anyway so that my wife does not miss out on a year of athletics. Thanks in advance!

By just filming the games you won‚Äôt have to deal with the problems of live-streaming (network issues, connectivity, low quality resolution, etc.). I would film the game, burn it onto a DVD (to archive for your family), and send the video file via email to your wife so she will be able to watch it the next day or at her convenience. If she cannot receive emails, I would just send her a copy of the DVD. Now I understand that your wife will not be able to see the game live however the long term effects and quality are much better than the hassle of live-streaming a low resolution video. Also by filming the games you will have something to potentially give to recruiters given your son wants to play college ball. The only reason I say filming better as well is in my personal experience live-streaming hasn‚Äôt worked well with my own swim races. ",2019-09-09 01:49:09

fzvfw4,Is there any point in having mandatory arts classes?,"So get this, I'm a 16 yr old in high school. Just finish my first semester and then I have to take *ba da ba dum* pottery. A fucking pottery class. Personally ive never taken any interest in the arts other than music but over all I think most high schoolers can say they hated taking art class. Its not a good place for people who dislike or don't take an interest in art imo so making it a requirement to pass is pointless. I'm currently planning on going to a trade school to be an electrician and we have an early trade school program through our high school called gci where we can get legitimate trade skills and graduate with a job. Now I dont know about you guys, but something tells me I'm not about to go fix a transformer and then give the lady who called in the power outage a pinch pot lmao.

For those who just wanted to read something for a bit, stop here. For those who wish to debate the topic at hand, Continue.

A few things I noticed during the 2 months I spent in my pottery class before quarantine (yeah thank god coronavirus saved me from making more paper mache molds) the first was maybe 6-8 students there actually cared about art/the class itself. but the rest either blew the class off or half assed everything they did since there isn't any way to gauge a high school students artistic learning except for seeing if they know how to do it (your skill can be ass as long as you can do it they cant really fail you for just being bad at art) the next thing was its a major waste of resources to have 20 uninterested students using clay, paint, tons of paper, and whatever the hell goes into the weird adhesive for the paper mache molds when it could be used by someone who actually wants to do art and will make something out of it that reflects some aspect of who they are. Art imo derives most all of its meaning from the artists personal affinities, thoughts, and emotions that were put into it. Its a waste to make someone who doesn't take any interest in art to take an art class if everything they make is just for a grade. It will be devoid of meaning, it won't have any sort of personal value to anybody especially the artist. Art is a hobby, a passion if you will for the people who truly enjoy it. If arts classes were made elective choices, everyone who joins will be contributing art with value and all the artists in the school will now have peers with mutual interests to learn and grow from. BUT, ya know what's the real kicker in all of this? What the mainnn reason it should be an elective is? Its cause I DONT NEED KARENS FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL ASKING ME FOR PINCH POTS ON FACEBOOK WHEN IM IN MY 40'S CAUSE SHE REMEMBERED ME TAKING A POTTERY CLASS MY SOPHOMORE YEAR.

I wish we had more classes that would help us run our own businesses and manage our finances considering most graduates from my school want to own their own business.

e248tw,advice?,"Hey, I was looking for some advice about this situation.

I (F15) used to hang out with this group of friends (all F15) back in my grade nine year. They were nice and were my only ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends I had as I was brand new. I had a lot of memories with them and thought of them as great people. However, we began drifting during second semester and faced bumps because of some insecurities I had about them, which was feeling left out and like I had to be quiet so they could talk. I ended up leaving that friend group near the end my of grade nine year as I had found new friends who I felt better with. I thought we ended on decent terms with one another, I‚Äôm only close with one of them nowadays.

Now fast forward to yesterday, after a couple of months of not talking, I find out that three of the four girls in that friend group all unfollowed me at the same time. It hurt. I can‚Äôt tell if it was planned or not but I do believe that it was intentional as one of them who was following my spam unfollowed as well. If this was planned, they definitely didn‚Äôt tell the fourth friend and probably have been talking behind my back about this.

My question is; why? I thought we were okay, sure not as close, but I didn‚Äôt hold any grudges against them and I thought they didn‚Äôt as well. Some close friends gave me advice of not giving your time towards people who won‚Äôt reciprocate, but it‚Äôs definitely rough to suddenly be punched after what you thought was doing okay.

I feel like I‚Äôm just slightly venting but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do in this sort of situation. Do I say anything or nothing at all? Do I pretend everything is good? I have classes with one of the three girls and it felt like she was trying to avoid me.

8b4m3t,Am I that socially awkward?,"I'm 16 and a high school junior. I have a few friends who tell me that I'm am really socially awkward and that I don't understand social cues. Its mainly in this one class- in my economics class, we were going over market/command economies and I started this debate on whether this one nation was socialist, and all my classmates hated me after that because they just wanted to use their phones and do their homework but they couldn't. And then this one time, the teacher said this assignment was due on Thursday, and I said ""isn't it due on Wednesday"", and everyone groaned- I know what I said was stupid but it was an accident. Mostly, I asked a lot of questions in class that aren't exactly ""smart"" questions (mostly questions like I don't understand this...) but I still get good grades so I'm not that stupid. And sometimes, I try hard to be friends with someone who doesn't like me. 

Some of my friends say I'm not that socially awkward, but a few of my friends (especially the ones who care about popularity) call me socially awkward and tell me that I don't understand social cues. They told me that everyone in my economics class made fun of me, snickered when I talked, and called me socially awkward. Am I really that bad? Will this affect my life, or is it a small thing?

I honestly can‚Äôt hate on you for being yourself and the same goes out to others. Most of us are quiet because we care about what others think about us so we try not to do anything weird. Some people either don‚Äôt care about this or don‚Äôt think about it at all. People usually ignore what others think about them when they‚Äôre with a group of friends, this is why some people say they‚Äôre quiet around people they don‚Äôt know but they let themselves go when they‚Äôre with friends. As for you, it sounds like you have just started thinking about what others think about you. There‚Äôs two ways you could approach this: you could continue to be yourself and express yourself freely around everyone, or you could control what you reveal around people that you don‚Äôt know and be yourself around people you‚Äôre close to. The bad thing about the second option is that you will feel repressed and sad sometimes, but you will at least seem less awkward to people. Personally I am in between both of them. I‚Äôm a very out going person sometimes but I know my limits because i don‚Äôt want to make people uncomfortable. So you have to decide at this point what you value more, yourself or the comfort of others. At our age, people are easily annoyed because they‚Äôre overly-conscious of the image they put out, so if you choose to acknowledge their opinions of you, you‚Äôll end up concealing your personality greatly.

So many rumours are going around that I‚Äôm gay, I‚Äôm hooking up with guys. How can I shut these rumours down? Will people ever even care for what I have to say or will they just disregard me.

Student: ""Ms. Derpette, will this assignment be graded?""

Listen, bitch. We have been raised to worship our education.

So you telling me not to worry about my grade because you're concerned that I won't take your arbitrary assignment seriously is not only infuriating but also offensive. If you're going to decide my future based on the letter you mark on my transcript or the number printed as my GPA, don't tell me ""not to worry about it"" when I ask if something is graded.

fdtyfm,"Advice needed for the future, help with motivation and will.","I don't really use Reddit altogether that much, but I do enjoy browsing it and have found many answers to countless queries and personal conundrums.

To give a bit of contex, I go to a privileged swiss IB school, i have never studied nor revised for a single test. Ever. I have an IQ of round 130 ish, I have AD/HD and I have not done homework since my 4th year at school, somehow leading to my achieved grades of A's and B's. (I am also in my 12 year/junior year).

I find homework to be extraneously boring and a particular waste of time, and although I know it can expand my knowledge to great lengths, the underlying problem is that I cannot find a way to do the given work. I have no genuine ambitions, no interests and no areas of which really interest me particularly. When I write my essays I leave them as they are without editing, as I also find it repetitive to reread.

I often see people doing better than me purely because they memorise the entire schoolbook. It's frustrating because I know I could do 30-40x better than them. Whilst I am certain I will easily make it into college without much effort, I would like to find some sort of purpose or interest. 

Whilst this, of course, is all extremely pretentious I do not think I am a genius whatsoever, I have many friends who are less intellectually capable but achieve leagues more, merely because of will. I am critical of myself because I realise these facts, however I struggle to find a way to improve.

I would be extremely appreciative of any help.

fa07tl,I feel like I‚Äôm working so hard in high school for nothing.,"Hey everyone,
This is my first post on reddit. I was a little nervous at posting since I feel like everyone is going to think Im exaggerating and ungrateful but here it goes. Background info: I‚Äôm currently a junior in highschool. I‚Äôm Hispanic, and come from a low-income family. I‚Äôll be the first one in my family to graduate from college. I‚Äôve always loved school. Ever since I was little I knew I wanted to go to a  good college and help my family.  I did well for most of my school life. I was accepted into a  middle school that helped low-income students in getting into the best high schools in the state. The middle school had a rigorous curriculum and most students  dropped out because they couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure. The school was from 7 to 5 PM. I did well and graduated with mostly  A‚Äôs with a few B‚Äôs. I was accepted into my first choice highschool in which I receive SO MUCH financial aid  plus books and transportation to school. The school is an hour away which means I have to wake up very early in order to reach my bus stop. If I miss the bus I can‚Äôt go to school, which was already happened once. I return home in the evening. I don‚Äôt even relax after school. I do homework, eat, shower, than sleep. Currently I am doing so bad at the school that  I think have a GPA of less that 85%. I won‚Äôt be surprised if I‚Äôm at the bottom 20% in my school. My school has honors and AP classes, however if you want to take honors or AP, you have to apply. I have applied many times to honors and AP classes but i have never been accepted into one which is embarrassing when everyone around me believes that I take all advanced classes. It‚Äôs embarrassing when everyone around you has taken at least one honors class except you. It took me till junior year to make friends and even then i feel lonely. I wasted my entire freshman and sophomore year by myself studying for tests just to get a B-. I told myself why try to make friends when you can study, yet that made me miserable. I took the SATs and ACTs in the fall and my stats were very horrible. I did 70% better than other students in the test scores. One of my dream schools was Uchicago, but I don‚Äôt have a chance anymore.  It just  hurts to know that you worked so hard at school since the age of 10 just to know you‚Äôll never have a chance to get into your dream school. I feel like I wasted my time in  middle school studying when I should‚Äôve been having a fun time. I hate waking up to school very early . I hate being in the bus for more than an hour. I hate having to be at home by evening  desiring  to relax only to know that i still have homework to do. I hate my grades. I just hate...everything. I don‚Äôt regret  applying to this school but the school stresses me out a lot. Dropping out and going to my public school isn‚Äôt an option to me  because many people that I know will humiliate me for it and I just can‚Äôt throw away a lot of financial aid in the trash. The only thing working in my favor is affirmative action, my extracurricular activities, and the fact that  I love humanities. The only excuse for my bad grades is that  something  occurred during my sophomore year but that‚Äôs about it. Currently I‚Äôm  studying for the SAT and ACT to raise my scores a little. I honestly just want to graduate highschool by this point.",highschool,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/fa07tl/i_feel_like_im_working_so_hard_in_high_school_for/,False,,13,"‚ÄúThe only excuse for my bad grades is that something occurred during my sophomore year but that‚Äôs about it.‚Äú

No, your schedule is insane. If I remember correctly it‚Äôs like the schedule in South Korea, where 60% of the students reported suicidal ideation.

you don‚Äôt have to enter indentured servitude just because of the money you were given. In what world is it normal to thrive when all you do is work, when that isn't what you want to do?   


Is there another school you can transfer to, besides the public school? Does your school have a dorm you can move into?

Its good to to have your eggs in different baskets, but you‚Äôll never be able to fill up all baskets with eggs.

consider cutting back on some of the more difficult classes, and focusing on a few, that way you can get a few honers and ap classes in your desired subject, as well as a higher GPA.

‚ÄúI took the SATs and ACTs in the fall and my stats were very horrible. I did 70% better than other students in the test scores‚Äú

At least you better then that 70% of trash. JK. But sort-of-seriously, you don‚Äôt have to save the world, gain a noble peace prize, and found a field in Medicean. You need some perspective. Your already doing pretty well.

And if you mean you did 70% better then your classmates, in your selective school, then honestly, what the frick- ",2020-02-27 05:03:46

By that I mean that teachers won't be demanding that you study for their quizzes and they won't ALWAYS give review packets. You'll need to figure out how you suited best and manage your time. Try to start your homework a few minutes after you get home so you don't get distracted or tired or lazy (speaking from lotsss of experience)

Also, people say that you shouldn't freak out about college, which is definitely true, but you SHOULD start exploring extracurriculars. Freshman year, your workload isn't as bad and college is farther away so now is your chance to try out lots of different clubs and research different programs for things your interested in. Pick a couple of things you'd be willing to spend time on every day or week and stick with them, so by sophomore year you can commit even more and maybe get leadership positions. If you're going into high school with a talent and you're passionate about it, then great! Stick with it and put most of your energy into that but still make *some* time for other stuff you want to try.

Finally, have an AMAZING summer before high school starts, because after that it starts to get serious. Enjoy it and come back to school rejuvenated :)

alukil,What does it mean if my friend/girl who I like sent me this letter/photo?,"So my fried/the girl who I like sent me [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/qGDNqcf). 

What does it mean... ? 

For some context, for the past 2 weeks, I‚Äôve been talking a lot with her lately again after 2 years of not talking to each other. Long story short, I liked her in middle school and we use to be really close but once high school started, I distanced myself from her and was basically an asshole by doing that and didn‚Äôt like or even talk to her. 

2 weeks ago, I reconnected with her since it‚Äôs been a while and we both had a History Day project to do and I wanted to see how she was on it (I also wanted to just see how she was in general). 

Ever since 2 weeks ago, we‚Äôve started texting each other a lot. She said ‚ÄúGoodnight u/GodofWar1234, sweet dreams‚Äù (with emojis) once and messaged me first for the last 2 (well, now 3) conversations we‚Äôve had so far since I talked to her again. And just today she sent me that picture. 

(If it adds any further contexts, 2 days ago, I also confessed to her that I like her. She didn‚Äôt say much about that but we then had a really nice and engaging conversation that night and she‚Äôs been really engaged to our conversations ever since I confessed that I like her).

djedji,Would you switch history/English for an extra math/science?,"Disclaimer: this is a social experiment to which I intend on extracting interesting data. If you are a die-hard English or history student, great! Give me your opinion. 

So my curiosity began when I asked a few friends at school. Then I asked a lot more people after that. Ever since, each and every person claimed they would swap their history/English for an extra math/science if given the choice.

Now, does that mean history/English are useless subjects alone? Of course not. The two subjects are crucial (truthfully, until about maybe 10th grade). But what my data has proved so far is that they might be minority classes (but there might be bias of course). 

So that‚Äôs why I am here. I‚Äôm just simply wondering if you guys, if given the option, would swap your English and history subjects for an extra math/science. 

And to those who will argue that people will grow dumb in English and oblivious to history, I want to point out that this choice should be a highschool decision. English reaches its prime at about 9th grade. After that it neglects teaching the actual language and shifts to humanities (literary techniques and what not). After doing research, the content taught after 9th grade English is only relevant to English majors or AP elective credit (college apps truthfully don‚Äôt require that advanced literary techniques, although it would be slightly advantageous). 

After all, the most popular majors are biology, health, business, marketing, communication, and nursing. So why is English and history the most heavily endorsed subjects in America? (My highschool and plenty others only require 3 years of math/science but demand 4 years of history/English). 

Upvote if you would swap them, downvote if you would resist it.

d79j1q,Stressed about a girl and idk what to do,"This is probably the wrong subreddit to be posting this but idk where else to post this on. 

So in 8th grade i was a huge fuckboi, looking for any girl who was hot that i could lose my virginity to (i really regret those times). Among the 12 girls i had my eyes on, there was thing 7th grader, lets call her sarah (no that is not her real name). Sarah was in my 5th period algebra class and we sat right next to eachother. The other place we would meet would be in our theater teachers room during lunch. I had a lot of fun with her in that class and i think thats where i had my eye on only 4 girls at this point and she was still on of them. 

Ffw to the end of the year, to when the 8th grade party was. I said goodbye to a lot of my friends, exited the gym and screamed ""FUCK THIS SCHOOL"" and then i made my way to our theater trachers class. Sarah was the only one there as well as our teacher. We talked about how it was the last day and we hugged like 2 or 3 times in our conversation. At the very end i asked for her number bc i didnt have any contact with her (slick right). Ffw to that very same night and were talking on the phone and i say how i had a crush on her for practically the entire year. She said she also had a crush on me for quite a while now. This is big to me bc i was under the impression that i was ugly and that no one would talk to me and then this 9/10 starts liking me. That summer i fell in love with her. Albeit over the phone, i still cared for her to the point ill die for her, i still do. That same summer we kept talking about how much its gonna suck for us to see eachother bc of the grade difference. We both planned to go highschool A for our highschool years and i could see her at the bus stop, cool.

Until at the very end of the summer i was told ""we have no choice but to put you in school B"". Weve been talking ever since over the phone but we still love eachother a lot and want to see eachother.

Im now going into my sophomore year at school B and shes now at school A. Bc of the long distance, she started dating someone that idc to say that his name is ben. Ben is like how i was last year. A porn addicted freshie fuckboy. Ben, has been trying to get sarah to do stuff that she isnt comfortable with and i keep telling her how toxic he is and how rapey he sounds. Problem is, she doesnt know anybody at School A that is in her classes and without him she'll be lonely. 

(This is to clear a few things up bc im not the best writer.
1. The things that ben does is make ""bet"" that she has to show him her in her bra by the end of the week. Or try to touch her boob on the first date. He also says how much he loves her but he also talks about other hot girls. Keep in mind this 1st half of 1st marking period. They didnt know eachother before highschool. 
2. Me and sarah talked over phone at first but we talked over her house phones phone number. Ever since we talked through Illegally downloaded instagram and wattpad. And thats the problem, she has super strict parents that check her phone and history and which apps use battery. They check her location when she goes out and doesnt let her go to friends houses, only letting friends over to her house. And they are all female
3. Me and sarah have agreed that dating is okay bc of the long distance. The problem i have with her dating ben is how creepy he is.
4. An extra reason as to why her parents dont allow guys over is bc she had a brother that impregnated his gf when he 16)

I dont know what to do. Sarah has been unresponsive lately and whenever she does respond its really only on the weekends and in short text convos of how much we miss eachother and how horrible ben is.

This is an IB HL Math course and the 5 points i lose from her basically make my 4.0 GPA to 3.8 overall. I think I have one last thing i can resort to because at this point shes ignoring me. The teacher of the other HL Math class only graded 10 homeworks while we had to do 18(everything is the same between classes so I don't know why this is different) , is it possible that I can call this out as unfair to the school so they can change the way it is graded?

I dont know how to study efficiently. I spend a lot fo timneme studying bu ti dont know do.

How should I study? I dont know how to. I need to be efficient. One of the reasons for my lack of motivation is that i need to study a lot of time and i just cant.

g2yvrt,Questions about the two last week in high school before graduation,"Hello!

I am a Swedish girl that need to know some things about high school in America. I am working on a book that takes place in Fairhope, Alabama and my main character will have about two weeks left in high school when the book begins. I have decided that she will graduate the day after the classes ends and that the prom will be the evening before graduation. She has already passed all the important tests before the book starts. So I was wondering what students in high school generally do in school when they have about two weeks to graduation? Do they have like some lectures left and some submissions left to do? I want her to go to ordinary classes too before she graduates from school. I do not really know what you do in school after all big exams are done and you are close to graduation. 

That is why I am asking :)

This is fiction and I can do kind of whatever I want to, but I want it to be somewhat accurate. And when is the finals exams anyway before graduation? Does it sound logically that all her exams are over when she has less than two weeks left in school? And I want to know a bit more about the prom too. I know that the prom can be months before graduation, but my book circles around the prom as a big event, so I want  it to be in the end of school. I want all kind of info what you do the last two weeks as a senior in high school. It will be really fun hearing from you! :)

d5fj3k,A teacher got me really angry and I feel wronged.,"Today during the first break I was in the classroom with anither classmate. She was holding her phone and playing games (I guess). In my school phones are forbidden. Nobody was in the class though so I took out my phone but hided it (so that nobody sees it and I read a message in my notifications. Then a teacher came in the classroom and asked my name and my surname. I told him and he said to me "" WHAT DID WE SAY?"" and then he quickly left the classroom.

I have never had lessons with him so I dont recall ever discussing anything with him. At first I felt that he might be overreacting but then... I got VERY ANGRY with what he did. After the end of todays classes I met my brother in the schoolgates and as we were returning to our home he said to me:"" I learnt that this teacher caught you using your phone. He told me in front of the whole class.""

Then I raged but I held it in trying to be calm. He told in front of my brothers whole class that he caught me using my phone.

Let me tell you something


1. What I do with my phone is none of my brothers or even more his classmates business.
2. He never said anything to my classmate who was very obviously using her phone. 
3. Even if it is forbidden to use a phone at school I am not the first nor the last person using it so I find it very unfair to only lecture me because I read a notification.
4. He should have spoken clearly and not talk to me as if I am a disobeying toddler.

bszrzp,Is this schedule too much for a high school senior?,"1. AP Literature (involves hours of reading)
2. AP government alternating with AP Economics (I have no idea about the workload in this one)
3. AP Calculus AB (a lot of work)

7. AP Chemistry lab alternating with study hall
8. Physics Regents
9. Gym alternating with physics lab

cic3vj,How I improved my SAT reading score by 200 points without a prep book // SAT reading tips/strategies: ),"Hi guys, I made a video with SAT Reading section tips that helped me improve my reading score by 200 points! I started off with a **540** on the reading section but eventually I began to consistently score in the 720 to 780 range on official practice tests and ended up getting a **740** on the real test. People say you can't really improve your reading score by much but that is NOT true! You can improve your score in the math, writing, AND reading section. And unlike the math and writing section, you can actually have fun ""studying"" for the reading section!

While grinding through a bunch of practice problems helps, that alone won't do much for your score. You have to make sure that you actually understand what you're reading in the passages in order to correctly answer the questions *consistently.* That's where the prep comes in. In the video below, I go over the ways I ""prepped"" for the reading section (in addition to doing practice tests) and I share the strategies that I used when tackling reading section questions/passsages.

[SAT reading section prep/tips/strategies](https://youtu.be/WNOw8TQcnKo)

cewc53,Is Junior Year That Bad?,"I was an A to low A student and started sophomore year doing marching band and taking APWH (along with all 4 honors classes). It was my first year marching and was totally unprepared for how little time I would have to finish hw/study. I ended up getting a C in APWH and B in 2 of my honors classes by the end of the first quarter. Eventually as marching band ended, my grades began to improve. APWH was still a difficult, but I took the ap exam and got a 4. I ended sophomore year with a 3.8 GPA. 

I‚Äôm now a rising junior who is going to take APUSH and APENG11 along with all honors classes.

Besides the dropped marching band, I‚Äôm taking 10th year of piano and I volunteer during the summer at the local hospital.

amlito,I'm Confused Too," 

**A Letter to Whom It May Concern**

I‚Äôve thought about it for a while. As a high school student, I have no idea what I am doing. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm an adult or a child, responsible or immature, smart or dumb. I have no idea what I am or what I will be. What I do have is a slight path. A hidden thoroughfare that sparks off the side of a gravely main road. Something so carpeted with loose leaves and coarse dirt, you can barely make out the edges where the road stops and the grass begins. I have an idea of direction with the road. I have an idea of direction with my life. The time to choose approaches as a rapid freight train, shining its harsh light on my eyes. The time to choose what you say? The time to choose what I will do for the rest of my life. Three months before, I am asking to use the restroom. Three months before, I am eating lunch made by my mom. Three months before, I would die if I left the state without my parents. Three months later I‚Äôm an adult. Three months later I‚Äôm expected to choose what career I‚Äôd like. My parents decided the trivial things in my life. I couldn‚Äôt even choose what I was going to eat for dinner yesterday! What was for dinner, when I would stay up till, when I should get a haircut. Now it‚Äôs up to me to decide what‚Äôs for dinner. And what I want to do for the rest of my life of course. It‚Äôs the little things they leave up to me, you know? I have a slight path of course. I still have that dirt road that veers off into an unknown forest filled with delight, deceit, and dreariness. This forest contains an entire lifetime of adventure. But I think I‚Äôm going to go in feeling hopeful. I‚Äôm going to try to continue to feel that optimism and fight my way through the forest. I‚Äôm going to try to live a life where I can feel fulfilled. We all know it‚Äôs not feasible to aim to be happy all the time. We all have our off days. We all can feel like we don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going. We can all feel hopeless, aimless, forlorn, or defeated. Isn‚Äôt that the point though? Life isn‚Äôt Disney World, as much as I hoped it would be as a kid. I wanted to grow up and feel magically content all the time. For me, it‚Äôs not always like that. I‚Äôll be going to college in a year and I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt know what I am or what I will be. No, I don‚Äôt know very much, but I have an idea. I have that thoroughfare. I have that beaten, barely visible path that I‚Äôm willing to jump on and follow with hope in my heart. So to all those that don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre going to do, if they‚Äôre going to be happy, or to anyone who is lost in general. I‚Äôm right there with you. I don‚Äôt know very much but if I know one thing, it‚Äôs that you‚Äôll feel better. If you look, you‚Äôll find that broken, run down, janky path that stems off the road. The one with no signs or guidance. Just a path to follow. Now that may not seem fun. But hey, who said we can‚Äôt have fun on it? No signs, no rules, right? I promise to all of you, I‚Äôll have fun. I promise I‚Äôll do my best to make my younger self happy and fulfill his wish. I hope you guys do too. But what do I know? 

Best,

aeefaz,Really need help with school right now,I had been doing very well in school up until about 2 months ago. My grades started dropping and I have a really hard time focusing in class now. I feel no importance to any of my classes and have no urgency to get any of my homework done which causes me to be behind with late assignments. Sports takes up my night and so I don't get much sleep so occasionally fall asleep in class also. I just really need advice on how to do better in school and how to take advantage of the little time I have at home with studying. Thanks!,highschool,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/aeefaz/really_need_help_with_school_right_now/,False,,6,"I struggled with the same problem. I lacked motivation, was watching tv when I‚Äôm supposed to do hw and thought it was fine. But I knew I needed to buckle down and try harder. The decisions you make today create the choices of tomorrow. And i new I needed to make better decisions so I had better choices. Here are some things I‚Äôve done to motivate my self: 
1. Watch blog videos of people you want to be like - I watched lots of aesthetic note taking blogs to improve my note taking, I watched blog videos of students who went to the college I wanted to go to, I watched all kinds of tips and tricks videos such as ‚Äòtips for staying motivational‚Äô ‚Äòthings I wish I knew in high school‚Äô or ‚Äòwhat really matters in highschool‚Äô these can be very motivational and helps to watch them when you begin to feel lazy 
2. Make sure you have a personal personal life you take care of - make sure your  health physically and mentally is stable enough for you to handle school and other activities. If you‚Äôre doing sports make sure it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of your classes and if it does, set out your priories and cut back on sports to make sure you can pass tour classes. Take really good care of yourself. Dress in a way that makes you feel motivated and ready to be active. (Wearing shoes whole doing homework is a trick I do because my body associates it with being active-same as wearing a day outfit not pajamas when working). Have a self care routine and a calming hobby. This is a good way to keep yourself calmed and de stress your life. Take a deep breath and break down a situation when you are feeling overwhelmed. 
3. Figure out a schedule and way or working that complies with you.- if you have sports after school or work or both, make sure you tell yourself that the time you have free or st home is for studying. If you live in a house where people ask you to do things and rest is hard to have, try talking with people to leave you alone to work or go to a cafe or library or someplace you like to work. When tour have a big homework assignment get part of it done on scheduled intervals so it doesn‚Äôt seem as big. And do the little assignments right away. Learn what style of notes is easiest for you to study and make them look good and neat so you feel motivated to study them later. Organize your binder and bag in a way that keeps you on track and do an organizational check every once in a while to put you back in shape. 
4. Locations matter - having a nice, quiet study space is crucial. St your home if you have a desk, make sure it is free from distraction. A decorated desk may look good but don‚Äôt have action figures or any thing as such to distract you. Try to keep it simple and neat and organized. Many people would say to work in one spot but I disagree. For me and my friends we work very well going out. I do much of my work at home most of the time, but when I can I like to go to my local small town cafe and order a nice drink and work. Or go to a library or park. Someplace reserved and generally quieter. A diner or place with lots of people would probably not be the best idea. But if it works for you then go for it. 
5. Music - many people listen to music when working which can actually help! However listening to your day playlist with heavy beat songs with lyrics can slow your thought process down because your brain wants to sing along with the music. Listening to video game or specialized study or calming music is best(with no lyrics or if it has lyrics, listening to songs in s language you don‚Äôt understand can work to). I personally listen to an orchestra version of video game music on iTunes and it helps me focus so so well.
6. SELF CONTROL - this is the biggest step to becoming motivated and active more. When you feel lazy and not compelled to do any work having self control is your only chance. When you come home don‚Äôt get on your phone right away or fall into the bed or couch to relax. Try getting water and s small snack and eating first then sit down with your work and lay it out in front of you. Forcing yourself to be motivated is the only way to do it. If you let yourself be lazy and sit around you won‚Äôt go anywhere, force yourself up and tell yourself it needs to get done. 
Remembered that the future you is judging your decisions. Remember that the present you in making decisions for the future you. Work hard for your dream because it‚Äôs possible! Do what works best for you and be the best version of yourself you can possible be. 
(I wish I had learned this in my beginners year of high school I didn‚Äôt start doing this until the beginning of my senior year so I hope this helps)
If you also have trouble getting off your phone there are many apps you can download to help. My favorite is called ‚ÄòFlora‚Äô where you have to keep the app on (doesn‚Äôt matter if your phone turns of) in order to grow a tree and every time you leave the app the tree begins to die. You can set times and everything. Very helpful!  ",2019-01-10 10:25:53

9k97my,"So, About this creepy guy...","Alright, before you read, I have a little disclaimer for y'all. Thinking someone's a bad person and just really, really disliking someone are two different things. End of disclaimer.

So, there's a guy who used to talk to me. Let's call him AT.
AT displays the following traits:

- Just a bit short
- Disheveled
- Smells like feces
- Long, shaggy hair
- Buck teeth
- Has a weird mustache that looks like it was drawn on with a dying sharpie
- Slouchey

Y'know, typical weird guy. He isn't a bad guy, though. He's just... Ew. No thank you. I remember first meeting him. He was pretty cool at first. We would talk about art, anime, d&d, etc. But one downside was is that he wouldn't stop talking to me. Literally, he would spill his guts all over me whenever he got his chance. He was super clingy as well, as he tried doing things for me like he was my little servant. He even tried helping me with tasks anyone is capable of doing on their own, for Pete's sake! But oh, the last straw was taken on that one day. It was during lunch, and I was chilling, minding my own business, when this bastard randomly asked me if I wanted to play truth or dare. Obviously, I went with truth, and what he asked still pisses me off. ""Do you like me,"" he bleated with a desperate grin. I was creeped out , but I decided to tell him. ""You're awesome! You're a great friend,"" I said, putting emphasis on the word friend. Then, he said one of the worst things a guy can say to a girl he hasn't even known for a month: ""Well, I think your body is nicely proportioned."" Externally, I thanked him, covering my chest and flinching, but internally, I wanted to punch him in the throat.

More creepy things AT has done are as follows:

- He tried to be subtle when he asked me to homecoming ""Just as a friend,"" but failed miserably
- I was showing my friend my sketchbook when AT got uncomfortably close to him to take a peek. I'd have to admit, AT almost looked like a predator looming next to my friend. AT then started to approach me, which caused me to scramble backwards into my seat. AT appeared agitated when he saw me in a state of fear, so my friend kindly told AT to leave me alone.
- He sat next too close to me during lunch, so I lost my appetite and had to walk around the school to cool off. I was on the verge of tears, thinking about how a weird guy wanted to do things to me. When I returned to the lunch room, I sat down in a fetal position. Unfortunately, AT happened to spot me and started walking towards me. I immediately tucked my head between my legs in fear. He crouched down next to me, a few inches from my face, and when I looked up a few moments later, he was still there. He started saying things like ""take my hand"" and ""Do you want me to grab your bags for you"". I politely declined everything, picked up my stuff, and rushed to my next class.

Edit: apparently he's done this done this stuff with other girls, including one of my friends. From what I can see, he's quite desperate.",highschool,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/9k97my/so_about_this_creepy_guy/,False,,7,"There's this really nice girl in my class that can't say no to anybody.

97gs49,My school implemented some new security policies and now I don't really feel welcome anymore as an alumna of my high school.,"Sorry I just need to vent. Thanks for reading this wall of text. 

My high school implemented some new security policies this year. Now, all visitors to campus require prior approval from the principal or the assistant principals before they are allowed to walk onto campus. 

People can not just sign in through the front office unannounced anymore like they used to. Before these new changes, you would just tell the the front office who you're coming to visit and they would call down to the teacher's classroom to let them know you're coming.

I graduated high school last year. Today, my best friend and I went to the school to visit our favorite teachers before we had to move away for college. We were not officially informed of the new security procedures beforehand, but my former science teacher did mention to me that all visitors had to be approved now. 

I did inform my science teacher that I was coming in advance via Remind text message a few days ago, but unfortunately the assistant principal was unable to approve the visitor request today as he was off campus.

We weren't allowed to walk onto campus, so my friend and I sat in the guidance office. My science teacher graciously offered to come pick us up in the office after school. Unfortunately, it just so happened that we walked out of the office right as my teacher walked in. 

The front office was extremely adamant that my friend and I leave immediately or receive a blue slip (a ticket), stating that security had just escorted some non-students off of the campus. They were very intimidating and forceful so we immediately obeyed and left out of fear.

To be completely honest, the person that threatened us with a blue slip almost made me cry. It took all my willpower to not break down in tears (I have a fear of authority due to a bad home life). 

I politely asked if we could go see a couple of our favorite teachers, given that school had already ended for the day by then. We were told no, rather rudely. Leave campus immediately or receive a blue slip. I stated that I was sorry multiple times and then walked out the door so no one would see me cry. 

I'm quite upset right now. I don't know why, maybe the physical and emotional abuse I've been through over the years has turned me into a sensitive and overly emotional person. 

To be honest, that really deterred me from ever visiting campus again. I don't know if I want to try visiting again tommorow. I don't know if or when I want to come back to my high school. 

I don't know. I really do want to visit my former teachers that truly made a positive impact on my life. I always saw my high school as a safe place that always provided me the support and encouragement my parents do not provide me at home. But now...I am not so sure. I am not sure if I will see my high school with the same warmth and welcoming atmosphere it once had or not. To me, it was the opposite of welcoming.

I'm really sorry. I'm probably a really sensitive person who is overreacting. I just needed to vent. Thanks for reading. 
",highschool,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/97gs49/my_school_implemented_some_new_security_policies/,False,,1,"I‚Äôm so sorry that this happened to you. I‚Äôm a teacher and I have a few thoughts if you‚Äôre willing to hear them. 

1. There‚Äôs no reason to threaten you with a blue slip because you were uninformed of the new policy. The office didn‚Äôt handle this well. I imagine this is somewhat due to them not knowing exactly how to handle the new policy, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse what they did to you. 

2. I hopefully don‚Äôt have to explain why this policy is in place. It‚Äôs unfortunately the world we live in these days. I don‚Äôt like being under lock and key in my school either. It sucks for everyone. Vote for gun control in your state. 

3. I think the teacher you were planning to visit could have made this easier on you too. They could have sent a request to administration on your behalf so that your visit was approved before you arrived. Again, this is probably something they didn‚Äôt think about because it‚Äôs a new policy, but it‚Äôs something you might ask them to do before your next visit. 

4. PLEASE GO VISIT! As a teacher, my favorite thing is hearing how well my students are doing once they leave my classroom. I actually called two of my own former teachers just yesterday to catch up. Teachers do love knowing that ‚Äútheir kids‚Äù are okay. We do think about you and worry about you. Send an email if you‚Äôve already left for college.  ",2018-08-15 17:08:57

I tried talking sense with my teachers, the course administration lady, head of school, all i get in response is that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù so they cant do anything about it. By the time I‚Äôm a junior (last august), I already finished AP Cal BC, which is the foundation for AP physics, but I got rejected once again when I tried to negotiate that i should go straight to AP instead of regular. The moment i bring up the request, their faces turned into confusion and disgust and asked me why would I want to do this and what is the point? Why? WELL BECAUSE ITS FUCKING EASY. Sorry if i looks ignorant and stuff, but anything stem related just makes sense to me, i usually understand everything in the first 5 minutes of the class when i glance through the practice question and examples. And this is even a private school, my parents pay 28k a year for tuition and I‚Äôm taking 7 classes so roughly 4K per class. I found every class to be extremely boring and a torturing experience. Today I had physics in first period learning about density. The people in my class is just so.....Imagine forced to relearn addition with a bunch of kids for 1 hour and 15 minutes, and everybody is really excited and the teacher is even doing experiments and labs! How fucking cute! I tried my best to not look bored and disgusted because I don‚Äôt want my teacher to stop liking me. It was a mental torture, recently i just find myself to be really depressed in school and my friends and teacher tell me that often. Every Monday I will walk in to school with the energy I‚Äôve accumulated during the weekends and walk out with a body without soul, i would felt completely drained of energy, attention span, motivation. I get massive brain fog after school and just feel like I‚Äôm not me anymore especially today (first day of school) Despite all my negative attitudes, i feel like school is harmful to me as a person, my intellect, creativity, mental health... I wonder how old the curriculum is, it seems like there is no innovation in the curriculum design at all for a long long time, most of my classes are just like a ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù, something that exist for its own sake if u can understand my English (not my first language). Idk, I‚Äôm kind of depressed in general since sophomore year, i have no one to talk these to and feel very lonely.

You're forming more/ better connections with teachers as you go on anyway. Waiting until you feel like you have teachers that get you academically and personally is always your best bet. Also, You could end up not even liking a teacher you asked for a letter of rec as a freshman by the time you're a senior. There's also no way they'll remember if you asked freshman year, like at all.

Maybe two or three months before the end of your junior year you should ask the teachers you want if they're cool with writing a letter of rec for you. If they say yes then you could always give a friendly reminder through email more towards the end of the year if you want. 

And finally, at the beginning of your senior year REMIND THEM AGAIN IN PERSON (and then send an email with the date that you might need the letter by, i.e Early Action Nov 1 or maybe Regular Decision Jan 1). Your teachers are human too. After a long summer it's possible that writing your letter of rec never crossed their mind once and they forgot. They most likely won't feel hounded or anything if you reminded them and thy know the struggles of the college application process.

adlvms,How to Be Popular: What's The Secret?,"I've recently been fascinated by the topic of popularity - how it works, where it came from, why some people have it, why some people don't. It's become increasingly obvious to me that popularity isn't fair. It's also become evident that popularity is not the same thing as being liked. For example, just because a beautiful blonde girl has nice clothes and a hot boyfriend it doesn't mean she's nice and that people genuinely want to spend time around her. Often, characters like Regina George in Mean Girls are the type of people you might think you'd want to be friends with, but in reality, they're terrible friends who stab you in the back and aren't there when you need them.

 I am currently taking Algebra II with trigonometry and I have a 62 right now and I had a 74 last marking period. I had 70-something averages in math for my Freshman year and Sophomore year as well. I just took another quiz today and I think I completely bombed it after discussing it with friends. 

I am not dumb as my math grades look. I have straight As in every other class this year, in some honors classes and made the honor roll the first marking period despite having that C- in math.

Freshman year, I took physics and I nearly failed since it was mostly math based. Then the next year and this year I am taking bio and chemistry, almost no math involved and my grades boosts to As.

 I am tired of being this bad at math. I study hard, pay attention in class, and get extra help. I still end up failing my quizzes and tests. I think I understand the topics but then during the tests I just blank out and make really silly mistakes or literally just forget how to do them.

The goal of this project is to write about 17 different perspectives, ranging anywhere from being class valedictorian, being terminally ill, having an absence in parenting, to even being victims of human trafficking. The idea is that I want the voices of the unheard, outspoken, unique, creative, you name it I want to hear about it. The project is in an effort to show how inequality is amongst us and how we never truly know people's full stories and what they're truly going through. Hopefully, this project can be eye-opening for people and make people realize that at the end of the day we have to treat one another with kindness and humanity because of the fact, we don't know what goes on behind closed doors.

Another way we raise money is by selling pizza right after school for $2 a slice. This is very popular. Our music department just started selling chickfila sandwiches after school for $5. 

Depending on how much money you need, the easy option is the food establishment fundraiser. If you are going to be constantly needing funds for the year, try selling pizza or baked goods after school. If you can get permission to sell baked goods at sports games, that‚Äôs always a good option too.

Whatever you choose to do, exposure is key. Promote your club and the fundraiser as much as you can by posting on social medias and telling your friends, passing out flyers and asking your school to announce it on newsletters or morning/afternoon announcements. ",2019-11-22 18:48:17

I've branched out and made more friends, however *my social life still feels extremely boring.* I know how everyone says you just need close friends or just need self-esteem, but that's never felt like quite enough. 

What I would like to do is to substantially increase my social status and popularity so that I'm no longer an outsider, *but at no sacrifice to myself, my current friends, and with no drugs*. Everyone says ""be yourself,"" and I think I've done that pretty well, but it still doesn't appear to be working as much as I'd like it to. Everyone likes me but I'm still on the outside of almost everything. I'd like to have some place, some meaning in the grand scheme of it all, but I don't know how to create that value. Idk if I've articulated what I'm looking for well enough...but maybe there's an off-chance that one of you has some piece of advice to give?

49kpvj,Rager at my High School,"Lemme tell you about one of the oddest in-school experiences I've ever had. When I was a senior, my high school's principle along with the student council set up an event where the idea was to make some ties with the unpopular kids and whatnot. This didn't sound like fun being that it was a Friday night, and that it was a school activity. The big tipoff for us seniors however was 24 hours of community service for just a 12 hour stay. All of us jumped on the offer and the place was packed.
      So we got to the school around 7 and were forced to do some awkward team building exercises that would honestly just leave you confused.  Anyways, by about 10:00 we were all escorted to two different hallways. One for each gender.  Lemme tell you, as long as we stuck to our hallways, they gave us free reign on the place.  Holy shit, we got to sleep in any classroom we wanted, and some people even pitched tents.  It was a madhouse.  We had Kendrick Lamar blasting at two in the morning, kids snuck alcohol into the rooms and we converted the smart boards into tv's and watched Netflix.  A ton of kids brought liquor, and the place was just a massive rager.  I have to say, it's incredible that none of the teachers sniffed out the booze.  People were taking shots.
      At about 3 in the morning, our principle came down the hall and asked if we wanted domino's delivered to the school. We paid up, and bought like 30 boxes of pizza.  At around 5 o'clock or so in the room I was sleeping in, most people called it quits and went to bed.  I can distinctly remember however getting pelted with an expo marker in the dark not 20 minutes later.  I looked up and the place was hoppin. There were at least 15 guys hurling un-capped expo markers, brownies, and really anything you could think of at each other.  Somehow I got another hour of sleep before some shitty wake up music blared over the PA.  We all woke up, and I swear to god the room was covered in thick black splotches of ink!  The smart board looked like it had been sprayed with dye from a marker that had exploded, and a kid sleeping under it had gotten showered by the ink. The place was trashed.  Papers and textbooks were everywhere.  Some kid had actually shoved a pole from someone's tent through one of the window screens.
       It must have been the alcohol.  We all packed up quietly, and left the room.  We never did hear anything about it from the teachers which was pretty fortunate considering the damage, but it was pretty damn clear, this team building sleepover event would never be happening again!  What the hell did they think would happen though? On a normal day, school can be a drag, I can concur, but if you asked me to attend a virtually  unsupervised overnight stay at my shitty public high school again, you could count me in.

After, the plan on having the executive and class boards (President of each class, vp, secretary, etc) come up and read the last words of all the victims. It is supposed to be a secret (I'm the only non-board member that knows), and I think it is absolutely out of their rights to make us listen to it; not because we are ignorant, but because it upset the entire audience, and the school board has no idea if somebody's friend/relative is a victim of 9/11.

I honestly thought lunches only get served like that on TV...

Recently there's been some bylaws, I think, that regulate the nutritional content of the food the school sells, but it's just made the menu even stranger. All the food is still shipped in via truck (because Odin forbid we eat fresh food!) but they've cut some things and repurposed others. Since the top-selling food was of course poutine, and they sold it every day, they simply changed the french fries to oven-baked potato wedges and called it 'healthy poutine' because it technically stayed within the boundaries. 

(It's also the most disappointing thing you'd ever tasted...)

But yeah, everything is served in paper trays or cups, everything's shipped in by truck, and everything sucks.

Luckily, everyone's free to bring in food or walk down the road to Subway or Macs. XD ",2012-03-03 16:15:54
nd2e1,College Admissions Rant,"I attend a private school with incredible college placement stats- around 40% go to Ivies/Stanford/MIT, and the other 60% for the most part attend fantastic universities and liberal arts colleges.  I've always been aware that students at my school have legacies at top schools and that helps a lot, but until this month, with the early decisions coming out, I did not realize that at my school it really is all about fucking legacy.  And affirmative action.

It is seriously breaking my heart to see some of my friends who are incredible candidates get rejected or deferred, while others who are not as hard working or smart get in because their parents are huge donors or their family has been going for generations.  

Example: one of my best friends who is Asian (this is relevant) applied to Stanford.  Freshman and Sophomore year, she had a ~3.8 gpa.  Junior year she had a 4.0 and had one of the top 3 gpas in the grade.  First quarter senior year she had over a 4.0.  On her SATs she scored a 2390, 800 Math 2, around 800 for Lit.  She's a brilliant writer and her college essays were funny, charming, and well written.  She's a passionate advocate of LGBT rights, is the president of our school's GSA, has done 2 internships with gay rights related non profits.  She tutors, volunteers at a soup kitchen, goes to a prestigious honors science program on the weekend, I don't know what more I can say to convince you she's perfect.  

She gets rejected, and these are the three people accepted: a nationally ranked fencer who's also really smart, a girl who is not incredibly smart but is not bad, has a ~3.6 avg, has legacy and her parents are one of the biggest donors, and a girl has a ~3.3, is really really nice but not that smart, is puerto rican, has legacy.

It really, really frustrates me.  Out of the 20 or so people who have gotten in early so far, half have legacy.  Half of that half are idiots.  As an Asian, I also feel the effects of affirmative action, and it honestly angers me that were I black or hispanic, I would have a much easier time getting into college.  And I realize this is all super ranty and what the fuck do I know maybe the college admissions officers saw something there that I don't, but it just feels so hopeless.  You can get perfect scores, be perfect, and sometimes it just doesn't matter at all.

Wow this is fucking long.

tldr; fuck legacy, fuck affirmative action, fuck harvard and yale decisions that are coming out tomorrow that will undoubtedly piss me off

EDIT: My best friend who is just as perfect as the one I detailed above (they basically have the exact same application amazingness) got into Harvard, despite being Asian, despite going up against a bajillion legacies, she did it and now my faith has been restored a little bit.",highschool,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/nd2e1/college_admissions_rant/,False,,10,fuck education?lol ,2011-12-15 08:06:46

He always says hi and smiles and shakes his head at me whenever he sees me, even though we re not friends and even though we never talk much, and like I said he s just in my math class and he s generally a shy person. He does talk to other girls sometimes but I ve never seen him do the same thing with any of them even though he s sort of friends with them and has known them for a long time. He d pass by me and my friend (one of the girls he has known for ages) and he d say hi to me and smile but never do the same for my friend even though they know each other. He never even does that with his guy friends. He keeps asking me the same questions over and over again, like what subjects I m taking and what not, and I always answer but he asks again when he gets the chance. He always asks me abt what books I m reading since I read a lot at school. I ve noticed him glancing and staring at me in math class (the only class we re both in) but he looks away. He also glances at me in the assembly sometimes. Idk what his deal is. At first I thought he was doing all this cause he's curious since I'm new to the school.

I also noticed him being quite clumsy and nervous around me, like he dropped his papers more than once in the library when he was sitting next to me, he dropped his pen, and he almost fell. He's a shy guy but he never acts this way around other girls. We never even talk at all tbh. I tried adding him on social media because I thouhut that maybe he's just trying to be friends, but he kept my request on delay and never accepted it, although he does have other girls on social media even though he never goes out with them or hangs out with them much since he's shy.

8vggc6,Strangest Kids in Your School,"Ok, so I read some of these stories and GODDAMN, I'm not the only guy that went to school with LUNATICS.   
This is one of the better ones but Ill share a few more if you guys like this.   


Ninja Attack in the Woods

I went to high school in Humboldt County. Kids there were fucking CRAZY. So in school, I heard a rumor about this nerdy ROTC kid showing up on a rainy night at a party by beating on the door screaming, ""LET ME IN I JUST KILLED A MAN!!""  


Understand this kid was tragic. Braces, bad skin, AWFUL clothes, glasses. Constantly bullied......BUT he was also the ""tall tales"" kid so he brought it on himself. He was the kid that would tell you he knew martial arts......had model girlfriends......etc. He essentially was Napoleon Dynamite but in 1990.   


So as the story goes, everyone at the party was a bit skeptical. He's standing there, out of breath and regales the party with the following tale:  


He was walking alone through Sequoya Park and a group of ninjas attacked him. He dispatched several, and one was fatal. In the ensuing fight, he was nicked with a ninja sword that was tipped with arsenic.   


Now his blood is 5&#37; arsenic (why wouldn't it be?)  


The ninja he killed? The son of a feudal lord in Japan and possibly Yakuza. To avoid a full assassination, Ninja Gaiden had to write a fucking letter of apology IN JAPANESE, in his blood to appease the mobbed up father.   


By now everyone at the party was fucking amazed and he led them to an abandoned house where he ""hid the body."" They of course didn't see anything that looked like a dead ninja and soundly mocked him.   


So I heard this story secondhand in high school, I wasnt at the party or anything. I just kinda assumed it was COMPLETELY made up because a lot of people hated this kid.   


I went on Facebook about 5 years ago and told a few bits and pieces of this story laughing (I was like 35 by then, as were my former classmates). 

IMMEDIATELY, a guy from my high school writes and says, ""DUDE THAT SHIT HAPPENED (Ninja Kid) SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE ONE NIGHT AT A PARTY. ITS JUST LIKE YOU SAID""   


I was pretty amazed, clearly the brutal ninja assault was horseshit but just the fact that this kid would take it that far was impressive. I wasn't ready for the next message from ANOTHER classmate.   


""Umm, you should see this. I was moving and forgot that I had kept this since high school. Your post reminded me.""  


He attaches a pic. 

A VERY clear pic of a letter in a baggie.   


In Japanese.   


In Blood.   


Fuck what anyone says, I'm never walking through Sequoya Park.",highschool,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/8vggc6/strangest_kids_in_your_school/,False,,10,"There's one girl that everyone calls ""grandma"".

Unfortunately I had her in one of my classes last year. She almost always had some food item, usually muffins or something, and it wasn't a pleasant site to watch her eat. One day she got two things of ice cream from the cafeteria before class, ate them both in class then burped.

Then one day before exams, the guidance counseler came in and told her about her ""accomodations"" for the exam. Her response: ""Is food allowed?""

The last think may or may not be true, because I didn't witness it firsthand, but supposedly she was seen on the Walmart website looking for deals on a mega pack of Lays. ",2018-07-02 14:23:27

ys5mt,A Letter to Students (From a Teacher) x/post from r/teenagers,"Hey all.  I posted this in r/teenagers the other night and someone suggested that I post it here.  If you're up for a read, feel free.  Enjoy.

Students of Reddit,


In the U.S. it is the time of the year that most students are beginning their new school year here in the next week or two. There's a certain mixture of anxiety and regret that comes with this time of the year as we adjust to the school-year life-style and all that comes with it, while wishing that we had suckled more from our precious Summer vacation. That feeling is not exclusive to students--teachers go through this strain as well.
When I was in school (not too long ago) I absolutely despised it. I loathed everything that was associated with my high school, save for my group of friends. I exhausted a great deal of energy being intentionally hostile toward ""high school"". In doing so I put myself at odds with a great deal of experiences that, I'm sure, could have been much more positive--especially when it came to my relations with my teachers. I never took the time to acknowledge that my teachers were, in fact, human. I passively accepted their presence around me for an hour each day but never thought twice about their innate human-ness (versus them being autonomous homework spewing robots that powered down under their desks each night).
I'm writing this to tell you three things that I've learned, both from my experience as a student and now as a teacher, that I wish someone had shared with me back when.

**1. The high school experience will be what you make of it.** There will always be the exceptional situations that are outside of our control (I had a friend commit suicide on the first day of our senior year, my mom was diagnosed with cancer my sophomore year, my best friend's dad was laid off and their family moved to another state to follow work my junior year, for examples). Those exceptional situations aside, your high school experience will be what you make of it: choose to make it something special. Choose to enjoy it. Be prepared to take a lot of your peers' actions with a grain of salt--become an expert at letting things roll off of your shoulders. Most importantly, keep a mindset that very few things that happen during your high school years are permanent--relationships, friendships, etc., are all things that change and grow throughout everything that comes after high school. Believe it or not, high school is more of a 'starting line' than anything else. There's a lot that comes next. Sit back and enjoy the ride.

**2. Academic success is a series of choices. You choose, a thousand times a day, to succeed or to fail. Believe it or not, those choices are ones that you will probably be making after high school as well--so start making the right ones now.** It's very common for students to tell me things like, ""Well I couldn't do that work because of my ADHD"" or ""I didn't have time to study because I had to work"" or ""I didn't do the homework but I get it, it's no big deal"". Overall, the high school experience is not about understanding Trigonometry or U.S. History or any other subject. Hell, it's not even about being prepared for a standardized test: it's about preparing you for Life. I always tell my students at the beginning of the trimester that I do not particularly care about whether or not they master the content in the class, so to speak: I care about their work hard--pacing themselves, seeking help when needed, planning ahead, meeting deadlines, communicating issues clearly, etc. While it's hard to swallow, the fact of the matter is that a lot of the decisions you make now will greatly affect how you make those same decisions after high school. Always putting your work off until the last minute? Not writing down due dates and forgetting about assignments? Not bothering to do assigned reading and trying to BS through a test? If you're accustomed to making these decisions on a regular basis now it will be all the easier to continue making them later. So don't. Choose success. Work hard. For some, that might mean getting off of Xbox Live and studying. For some it might mean putting off peer-politics during class to actively listen. For some it might just mean asking questions when they're lost. In any event, we all make choices and those choices are the largest contributor to our successes (and to our failures)

**3. Your teachers are human.** I'm fortunate to have a sense of humor that makes it enjoyable to laugh at myself. My students benefit from this as well, I think. Not all teachers are in that boat, though. You know that feeling you get when someone just gets right on your nerves--makes your blood boil and you just want to lash out and its easy then to jump the gun and say something without thinking it through? Teachers know that feeling, too. It happens to us all the time. We're human. You know that feeling where all of the sudden you realize you've made a mistake and a bunch of people are going to laugh at you and you feel so embarrassed that your heart starts pumping real hard and you break into a sweat? We do, too. The worst part of my days teaching--unconditionally--are when I have days that I treat my students unfairly. If my pride gets in the way, if I say something that I shouldn't, if I act out of spite, etc., when I get home I sit and just put my head in my hands. I'm telling you this so that you're aware that your teachers are going to make mistakes and when they do, I think it's fair to forgive them, even if they haven't acted in a way that deserves it. Until my first year teaching I had no idea how much work was put into my education. I had no idea that my teachers spent weeks at school during the Summer working (without pay) to help me enjoy myself more in class. I didn't know that my teachers dropped hundreds of dollars out of their own pocket (without any reimbursement) every year for the classes that I sighed my way through. I didn't know that my teachers spent their weekends working (without pay) to assess my learning. Not all teachers fit that bill, of course--but in my experience, honestly, most do.

**tl;dr**I hope that you can get beyond the anxiety of the coming school year and that you can choose an awesome, amazing year this year. I hope that you choose to succeed in everything that you do and that when you fail, you learn from it and do differently the next time around. I hope that you forgive your teachers when they act out or when they're unfair, because that will inevitably happen because they're people much like you, but they choose to work hard for you. Best of luck this year. Go do good things.

Note: This is a throwaway. I know a bunch of my students are redditors and I would prefer to stay anonymous--if you used my normal login someone might recognize it.


One thing worth noting: in the original post to r/teenagers someone pointed out a comment that I make about ADHD being used as an excuse to not work in here.  In saying this, I am *not* saying that ADHD is not a real, crippling condition.  It is.  I understand that completely.  The context that it's being used in is regarding when students use it as an excuse (versus a justifiable reason) to avoid their responsibility.

dztvwk,Highschool is suddenly a lot,"Where I live schooling is kinda weird. Im a sophomore but it's kinda technically my first year of high school. 1-6th grade is elementary, then you do Jr high for 7-9th, then 10-12th is highschool. So it's not really my first year of high school, but it kind of is, and it's just weird

I've not really struggled or stressed about highschool too much until these past few weeks. I don't need advice or anything, im doing fine, and I'm more than positive I can get things done eventually, I just need to vent and talk about it. 

I feel like it's taking a bit of a toll on me mentally, and it's just really stressful and not fun. I've always liked going to school and I've always had fun with it, and for the first time ever I don't really want to.

It's hard to keep up a social life and just have fun and keep up with grades, and I need to get a job eventually, it's a lot to balance. It feels impossible to have all three of those things, you gotta pick and choose what you want. And I'm afraid of being sick too. If I miss a single day of school it's almost just impossible to recover. I'm still pretty new to it though, im just really hoping I can pick up some tricks along the way or something.

drktou,Open letter to High School Seniors,"Dear High School Senior,

At this point you are probably totally done with the whole school scene. 

Same group of people. 

Same building everyday. 

Not to mention the same , boring classes each day. 

No doubt you are complaining about the freshman and how much you just wanna be at college away from your hometown. To be completely honest , when I walked into my high school during the first couple weeks of senior year I was thinking the same thing --- but you know what you should do instead?

Take a step back and enjoy the endless amounts of lasts

Your last homecoming and prom, 

football game, 

playing on a high school team, 

choir concert , etc.

Reflect on all the great memories high school has brought you.

After all they will become some of the best memories of your life . 

Spend quality time with your best friends,go out for dinners and have deep late night talks. Really take advantage of your last few months of high school. Be adventurous (take that class you have always wanted too) and maybe try a new hobby or food. It‚Äôs worth it, after all you are only a senior once. 

*So live it up.*  

If you are on a sports team like I was, the end of your senior season will leave you looking like a ‚Äúhot mess express‚Äù. The thought of not being with the team next year or  being without people who have become family is something you can‚Äôt even imagine. The last time in uniform will make you cry ( or sob like a lunatic in my case). A verse from the song ‚ÄúFive More Minutes‚Äù by Scott McCreery, sums up the feeling of finishing a high school sport which has been a major part of your life. It goes like this,‚ÄúAt eighteen turned my helmet in and walked to the fifty yard line. Just the coach and me after we lost eighteen to nine. And I cried man next time to get in here I‚Äôll have to buy a ticket. **Can‚Äôt you give me 5 more minutes**.‚Äù  

Along with all happiness senior year can bring , let us talk about the elephant in the room. *College*. Nothing is more stressful than applying to college especially your dream one.Or even figuring out what you want to major in. The pressure of that can make anyone break,especially if others are telling you to do something else. But what you need to keep in mind is that it is YOUR future. You need to apply somewhere that you would enjoy living at for 4 years. So apply to your dream college. And if you don‚Äôt know your major that is OKAY because almost everyone changes it once or twice.

Your senior year will be a cluster of emotions. And as you are walking across that stage at graduation taking it all in one last time, know that you made it.  You‚Äôll cry and laugh and worry for the future but my advice to you is to slow down , take in every moment and have fun. 

But most importantly , **just breath**. Life isn‚Äôt always going to go your way but you are going to end up where you are meant to be. So don‚Äôt stress. 

Sincerely , 

A college freshman",highschool,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/drktou/open_letter_to_high_school_seniors/,False,,2,"im senior this and has it ever been a shitstorm for me so far. first few months have been up and down everyday. thanks for this ill take the time to enjoy the moment, and have fun!

cmmqh2,I started highschool today. I was wondering if I‚Äôll ever get used to this.,"   I need some advice, kind of desperately. I‚Äôd love to know anyone‚Äôs experiences. This is my first post on this account, so here‚Äôs some background for what I‚Äôm about to write.

   I‚Äôm a guy, a 14 year old freshman who has some social anxiety (GAD), but can tough through it quite easily if I force myself to. Today was my first day of high-school ‚Äî I went from being in a rural little kindergarten through 8th grade school of 200 people to a fairly large high-school with about 1,500 students. That‚Äôs a big change, at least for me. I adapt well, thankfully, but I‚Äôm having some issues.

   I had to go to the office to get my schedule which is to be expected since they gave us our schedules online, which I was unable to access. This caused me to be late to my first period (Chorus, which I don‚Äôt remember signing up for but whatever, I‚Äôll give it a shot). I got laughed at when I came inside. I don‚Äôt really care though, I just went about my day.

   I suppose I should also say that my legal name is Jessica. I‚Äôm transgender, whatever, it‚Äôs not a big part of me since I look biologically male and I‚Äôm not some crazy stupid SJW who freaks out over the smallest things. When they called my name during role call in all my classes, I politely just said I go by my current name. Lots of laughter. It‚Äôs fine, they‚Äôre kids, I don‚Äôt mind. Got some murderous looks from some of them, hah. We live in the South so that‚Äôs expected as well.

   As the day progressed, two hours there felt like eight. When I looked at the clock when we went home (early dismissal on first day) I was shocked to see it was only 10 AM. I had to find out my bus number, and that took like 40 minutes as I was set on a wild quest for it, but it‚Äôs fine.

   I saw quite a few people I knew ‚Äî either people who had gone to my previous school years before, or some kids who had been in my class. I talked to a few of the girls and hung out with my brotherly friend and this one dude we had met when we had free time between classes.

I try to keep my head up but I feel kind of defeated from this. It‚Äôs a big change despite my usual ease I have in adapting, and I feel like I‚Äôll never get used to this.

37vygj,"How to Get into Harvard and the Ivy League, by a Harvard alum","As a Harvard alum and someone who got into every school I applied to, I learned a lot of hard lessons about college admissions. Lessons I wished I knew before I started high school.

I now work with a lot of high school students around the country, and I see a lot of mistakes being made that are far too late to fix.

I also see a lot of misery all around, because you're spending time and energy on things that you're not passionate about, all for the sake of improving your college application. In reality, they might not be doing anything to help your college application.

I've written a complete guide containing all of this information so that you can focus your time on things that really matter. This contains all the important points that I learned from my experience going through college admissions and learning about applications from my classmates.

Even if you're not applying to Stanford, the Ivy League, or other top schools, I hope you'll still find this useful for thinking about where you're spending your time in life.

I am a current junior and rising senior.  I was fed ""the kiss of death"" as a freshman.  Triple sport athlete, 8 APs, 3-time national academic champion in a meaningless competition (AGLOA), attended USA hockey national tournament as a goaltender. member of 3 clubs, 500 volunteer hours, etc.  A's in everything except AP economics.  Writing a small non-fiction novel.  Founder of the finer things club.  I play piano.  Really any pointless things you can think of.

The reoccurring thought that crossed my mind while reading the article was ""what if you like doing everything?""  With few exceptions, I enjoy being a jack of all trades, but also specify in mathematics.  I aced calculus and are taking calc 2 and calc based physics over the summer at a university.  I also plan to dual-enroll in the fall in security risk analysis and calc 3.

One of my biggest points of pride is my ability to surround myself with intellectuals and being well liked by those people.  I enjoy being around the best and often find myself not being the dumbest person in the room, but not the smartest either.  The problem is, I've always been in love with learning.  I'm good at everything and like everything, but show no real ""exemplary"" characteristics in anything.

How do I market myself to a top-tier school as the ""fluff"" that they want to surround their world class scholars with?  I only plan on applying to two top-tier schools (UPENN Wharton, UChicago).  Otherwise I want to go to a large public university either in a city or with a great campus culture (Alabama, Pitt, Boston U) for as little money as possible.  I am conflicted between engineering and finance as a major, and would consider dual-majoring at Alabama with a possible interest in something like corporate law.  Otherwise, I really want to specify in a mathematics related field like physics/engineering.  How can I also prove my ability to dedicate myself to one subject matter that I love?

Thanks.   ",2015-05-31 05:17:40

I carefully pick out each track and add it into my playlist if it fits in. The playlist is perfect to relax, focus, study, as background music, to set the mood...

5q0jk7,Should I even bother with my grades?,"I am what I would call a pretty good student. For the most part, I am able to turn my work in on time, and get mostly As and maybe a B or two during the course of the year, while taking all honors classes. I'm actually taking seven academic classes right now as well.
The problem is, this eats up all of my time. My school's grading system is mostly based off of homework, which I don't even see the point of. have practically no social life, but I do want to get a job sometime in the near future. I have other self-imposed activities and interests which dig into my time as well.
I feel like even if I did stop trying, I would still get decent grades. I don't plan on trying to get into any exceptional colleges, and I don't feel like I'm learning anything useful.
I like learning. In fact, I frequently read for fun, and watch YouTube channels such as The School of Life and Sci Show.
I'm just not sure whether it's even worth going through all the stress now just for it to mean nothing in a few years.",highschool,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/5q0jk7/should_i_even_bother_with_my_grades/,False,,2,"Stress and anxiety sucks and you're definitely just in asking ""is this all worth it??""

The specifics in World History, Geometry, Literature, etc. might seem pointless... And truthfully, you may never have to recall specific names of world leaders X and Y from 1946 in your professional life.

The biggest lessons you can pull from in highschool are the motions you're going through now to get you from point A to point B for goal C.

You're feeling stressed. What positive things can you do to manage it? 

You have 4 big projects due in the same week two weeks from now. What can you do to break it up into something easy to manage so that you're not pulling an all-nighter Sunday night?

You are very close with a friend, and you got into an argument over something that you never thought you would. Is this relationship salvageable? Does it matter?

Your favorite subject is ____, but why? What do you love about it? If you could change anything, what would you change?

In highschool we practice abstract ideas like leadership, stress management, interpersonal relationships, communication, knowledge retention, self-discipline, focusing on long term goals, courage, respect, empathy, etc. Examples of these ideas that come in very specific forms like studying for X or a breakup with so-and-so, but you'll be faced with these kinds of concepts for the rest of your life. You have the opportunity to practice them now with less penalty for screwing it up than you might years later. Plus, the second time we tackle a problem is usually easier than the first. :)

Somehow despite all the mistakes I've made in the past I've landed my dream job as an adult. I wouldn't trade this job I have for anything in the world, but there are still parts of it that I could totally do without. Muscling through the smaller parts I don't like allows me to keep my job to enjoy most of what I really DO like. I'm able to do this now because I've had practice eating what some would call ""a shit sandwich."" ",2017-01-25 10:15:05

cdb1zx,tips for dealing with anxiety? 504 plans? culture?,"first off, please excuse my awkwardness as this is one of my first posts on reddit lol. also, this became very long, but please bear with me. anyways, I'm going to be going into 11th grade this year and I'm very scared! I've been homeschooled since 7th grade, as I got very sick and had to drop out. My disease is pretty serious, but I've been in remission for a couple years now, so I decided I wanted to go back to public school. Problem is, I have absolutely no idea what to expect.

I've always had bad anxiety, and being isolated from my peers for 4 years has not done me any favors. I managed to keep one friend, and through her I met my boyfriend. Those two are the only people my age I have any regular contact with, and I'm very scared to be in a classroom setting again; surrounded by 20-30 other teenagers. My friends have tried to introduce me to other people, but I tend to get very overwhelmed and panic pretty easily if theres more than two new people. I'm working with a therapist and I think I've made good strides, but I'm worried that it's not enough for me to feel alright in a classroom. Anyone have any tips on dealing?

Another thing I'm worried about is expectations. As I said, I went to public school through 7th grade, but I've never even been in a highschool. I have no idea what ""silent rules"" there are! I'm sure they vary by school, but are there any that kind of umbrella all schools (ex. like not walking out of class to use the bathroom without asking, etc. lol)? I'm really worried about this, no matter how silly it sounds :(

Second to last, 504 plans. Because of my disease, I'm eligible for a 504 plan, which I'll be getting. I have ulcerative colitis, an irritable bowel disease (it's about as fun as it sounds), which I have symptoms of even when in remission. I have absolutely NO idea what accommodations I should ask for, because I have no idea what highschool is like for ""normal"" students. I'll be getting a permanent hall pass (for going to the nurse, bathroom, etc), but I dont know what other things I should ask for, as I dont know what the rules are. I know 504 plans vary wildly from person to person, ailment to ailment, and school to school, but really any help on them in general (from people with or without them! any recommendations at all!!) would be great.

finally, but this is kind of a stupid one: contagious illnesses. Are high schools like elementary schools? Do germs spread super easily? I have a suppressed immune system (because of my disease) and the flu strains from the past couple years could easily kill me, so I'm pretty worried about the contagious-ness of highschools! I get sick extremely easy, and when I do it lasts a very long time, so I'm kind of worried I'll have a cold for the entirety of the school year. which would not be fun at all. 

this kind of just turned into nervous rambling, and maybe I shouldve made separate posts for all of these paragraphs, but idk. Anyways, absolutely ANY help/advice would be much appreciated!!! thanks for reading all of this :)",highschool,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/cdb1zx/tips_for_dealing_with_anxiety_504_plans_culture/,False,,5,"I would try to get accommodations specifically for anxiety too. Not sure about our school but we had something called an IEP as well which is a bit more extensive than a 504. We also had classes called team taught which is taught by a gen Ed teacher and then a special ed teacher who is trained to help people with IEP‚Äôs/504‚Äôs. We also had self-contained classrooms which is a class taught by a special ed teacher that typically has 5-10 students, this could be really beneficial to you. I know the sound of special ed might catch you off guard, it‚Äôs not just for the deaf or blind or those with severe neurological disorders. I have ADHD and the class was perfect for me. Special ed often teaches slower and can be much more forgiving when it comes to being overwhelmed with workload or social issues. Accommodations you can ask for are frequent breaks (leave the classroom and take a walk for 10 minutes, etc), extended time on tests and assignments, and literally anything that will help you succeed.

Also with getting sick: wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after using calculators/textbooks or after sharing pencils. As long as you‚Äôre careful you should be fine I‚Äôve only caught something that went around the school maybe 3 or 4 times and I wasn‚Äôt really trying to be careful either. ",2019-07-15 09:22:07

That is the reason that I am creating In The Fall. I want to help make it easier for students getting ready to go to college to have all of the actually important data they need to make the best choice for them on the school they choose and then have a tool that can help keep them on track and organized throughout the entire process. If you would be able to spare a few minutes I would love some feedback from this sub on things as general as ""the website is hard to read"" to much more specific details like ""You seem to be missing this type of data and I think it would be really important.""

dlf8v5,I'm thinking about my future and I just need some advice,"I just started junior year, and obviously the question of what I wanna do after highschool is coming up a lot.

Tbh, I'm not a spectacular student. I recieved my transcript and so far I'd say I'm mostly a B- or B student.  I do care about my grades and try to avoid failing, but math is really difficult for me in general, so that's kicked my GPA down I think. However, I've been trying to stay in like English Honors and English AP.

(Also recently I took a PSAT, and I completely forgot it was happening that day. In the morning it was an english portion so I did well on that I think, but a few hours later it was the math portion and I was fucking starving bc I didn't eat breakfast like an idiot so I focused on not trying to have a grumbling stomach in an echo-y ass gym than the math. I literally just put random shit down bc I couldn't focus and was nearly having a panic attack lmao. I know the PSAT isn't considered as much but idk if it'll effect anything bc I know damn well I did horrible on it.)

I've had a pretty rough childhood and it has effected my school performance (I don't wanna use it as an excuse but some factors did make things difficult). I haven't had like someone sit down with me and try to plan things out, like GPA, scholarships, etc were really vague to me.

I really want to major in art. I'm confident at it and have been invested in it for years, and now I'm taking multiple art classes and been in National Art Honor Society for 2 years (I might be president next year bc all the seniors are graduating lol). 

So overall, I wanna get into a good art school or major in art, but I'm afraid that my grades and such are gonna effect what college I go to. I really wish I knew all about this stuff freshman year so that it would've motivated me in the hard times to try and get better grades. 

I've researched some stuff and some people say that if you explain in college applications that you had a rough time and you wanna become better that sometimes it'll help you out. Idk.",highschool,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/dlf8v5/im_thinking_about_my_future_and_i_just_need_some/,False,,5,"Colleges look beyond grades like they look at any after school clubs like chess or something that you committed for a long time. They look at community service like NHS (National Honor Society) If you committed to at least two after school clubs for your past highschool years then you're already doing better than the average senior graduate that just kept jumping around clubs and only doing 1 semester instead of committing to it for 3-4 years. because colleges look for commitment and since you're in NAHS then that's really good because you could have a leadership role which looks great on an application. Also, the PSAT doesn't affect you poorly because it is used to estimate your possible score on the SAT. I hoped I helped you out in any way, have a good day. ",2019-10-22 17:05:37
djgw80,My two friends fought over me every day on the bus,"This happened over 20 years ago (I graduated in 2000). I was friends with a girl named Candy (not her real name). We met in seventh grade, during which we were rivals for the affections of a boy I had a crush on (another story for another time). Anyway, I had another friend I met through Candy named Shawna (again, not her real name).

The three of us rode on the bus together every day. For a while, things between us were really good. Then, one day, things got heated with Candy and Shawna. They started fighting. I don't remember what started the fight, but it made the bus ride torture for me, mainly because I sat in the middle. The only times I had relief from it were the weekends, Thursdays when I stayed after school for chorus practice, and when I was home.

I spoke to Candy on the phone (we called each other every day) and asked her what she and Shawna were fighting about. She told me they were fighting over me. When I asked why, she said Shawna was jealous because we had a close friendship and she was the odd man (in her case, odd girl) out.

agbw2y,What do you wish you understood more of when it comes to mental illness?,"With #BellLetsTalk day coming up I can't help but think about everyone who is struggling with their mental health - first hand or second hand. Not only are those suffering going through hell, their families and friends can have a really difficult time trying to figure out what to say or do or how to help. My heart goes out to each person who has been impacted by any mental illness or mood disorder - you're not alone, and it's not your fault.

On a personal note, my mental health issues 'rose to the surface' in High School/University - when I became anxious about keeping up and fitting in with the kids who partied. There was a ton of pressure that I didn't know how to manage. I grew a lot from those experiences, but I still struggle sometimes to explain it to people.

I wanted to ask: what tips you have for helping a friend or family member when it comes to supporting their mental wellness? What do you wish you understood more of when it comes to mental illness?

Let's open up some conversation and work to end the stigma together.

Especially for marginalized communities like the LGBT community having visibility and someone talk to and having a safe environment to be in is unspeakably important.

Mental health needs to be maintained just like physical health. It's ok to have a therapist and see them on a regular basis. And therapists aren't only for mental I'll illness but also can be helpful to talk to if you've just had a stressful week.

Be there and listen to your friend. Sometimes there isn't a solution and you just need to be there for them to be an have an ear or be a shoulder.

If someone is doing self harm don't give out an ultimatum like ""if you don't stop cutting then I won't be your friend."" Be there for your friend and help them through it. Obviously self harm is bad and shouldn't be encouraged but if you are there for them, talk them down, care about them then that might be what they need to start stopping. If you go and give an ultimatum or get mad at them about it then that may be only making things worse.

There are lots of online resources for mental health. If you don't know how to deal with something, Google, or approach someone older like a teacher or parent or someone. ",2019-01-16 02:59:54

8j17am,would the school ever find out if I leave my hated teacher‚Äôs all-torn academic class t-shirt in front of the classroom?,"Few years ago, I took an AP course which not only flunked my entire year‚Äôs grade but also was partially respoinsible for my serious depression/suicidal thoughts (I was sent to mental asylum for few days).

7nvj9s,I'm a senior and I have some insight for freshmen (also AMA?),"**Warning: long post**

To anyone who's about to start high school, I would like to share my experiences with you so that you'll hopefully become a better student in the future. I'm currently wrapping up senior year, and I plan to major in mechanical engineering.

First off, I don't recommend going to a public high school, except if you know a good few of your friends from middle school who may be going there as well. However, this is risky because those friends you had back then can easily turn on you in the future. I would recommend either going into an early college program, private school, charter school, or home school instead. IMO, there's just too much drama and monotony in public high school to make it worthwhile, and you don't learn anything valuable there anyway (this is just my personal experience, and if any of you have a different experience with public high school, feel free to comment).

Next, I want to discuss class rank. Every high school is different when it comes to this. In my particular case, the highest GPA one can get is 4.0, and the top two students become valedictorian and salutatorian, respectively. AP and college courses (my school has a dual enrollment program) are given only 0.5 extra points if you made a B, C, or D. So at my school, you can basically become the top student by taking the easiest classes you can take, but YMMV. I live in Georgia, and Georgia Tech (a top-tier public university) gives automatic acceptance to the Vals and Sals from Georgia high schools. 

This sounds fine and dandy, right? Not necessarily. You'll end up missing out on your social life quite a bit, even if you were to take regular-level classes and ace them. Not all colleges will automatically accept top students, either. It all depends on your situation. What I ended up doing was taking college courses full-time since junior year and settling with a 3.5 GPA. My school has paid entirely for all 20 college courses that I'll end up finishing by senior year. While my GPA is much lower than it could be, if I chose to become more reclusive and try to get higher grades, I would have been more depressed and I would have burned out a long time ago (I ended up catching senioritis in my sophomore year anyway, but now I have two years of college paid for and I can transfer almost anywhere, saving me time and money). Don't be that intimidated by the difficulty at first, the worst case scenario is that you can start off taking one college course and barely passing it. Do your research on your professors, it's *vital* in order to know how you'll do in a certain class. I was lucky enough to have tutors on campus that I could get free help from in subjects like algebra and calculus.

As to what courses you should take, if your high school has a dual-enrollment or early college program, *do it*. Make sure you look into the transfer policy of the courses that you can take while still in high school. I did mine at a four-year university and all of the courses I've taken transfer anywhere in Georgia without any problems at all. Start taking these courses as early as you can (like, freshman or sophomore year, if you can) and try not to take more than 3 at a time. Even if you could handle more, you need to make a good amount of time to have for yourself, trust me. Taking 4 or 5 might be pushing it, as I have come to realize, but everyone has different limits. Most of the time, to get into programs like this, you need a minimum score on the SAT or ACT (usually around a 1000 on the SAT and a 20 on the ACT) and you're in. You might not even have to take those tests again because you can usually transfer the courses to another school and not be asked about your test scores.

While we're on the subject of college courses, screw AP. Only take the exams if there is no other way for you to get college credit in high school, but they're usually a waste of time and money, IMO. Not to mention, a lot of times, they don't even reflect the actual difficulty of real college courses. I'm not familiar with the IB program, but I would think that dual-enrollment is still better than that, as well.

If your high school doesn't have a dual-enrollment program, AP, IB, or the equivalent, then there's one other thing you could probably do that I have absolutely no experience with, but it's not necessarily a bad idea: drop out at 16, get your GED, enroll in community college, and transfer out of there with a high GPA (hopefully!) to a four-year institution. Sounds extreme, I know, but this wasn't my idea. It came from a guy named Aaron Clarey, and by dropping out early, he ended up getting his bachelor's in economics right when students his age didn't even start college yet. While this will also save you time and money, it's not ideal, and I would only recommend this in an extreme case.

My final thoughts--and I want to make this very clear--have fun during high school! Try to find a balance between work and play that works for you. Life is too short to worry about perfect grades, and you'll have many years ahead of you to make great friends, relationships, money, etc. Don't slack off, but don't overload on coursework, either.

TL;DR: Start college early if you can to get the general education requirement crap out of the way, but don't overload on the coursework in order to maintain sanity. 9/10 times, public high school sucks, don't do it",highschool,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/7nvj9s/im_a_senior_and_i_have_some_insight_for_freshmen/,False,,31,"I just wanted to say that I transferred to a public high school for ninth grade after going to a private school my whole life, and it was the best decision. Of course, public school quality completely depends on location, funding, etc., but mine offered all the same  programs that my old private school did and even more. There were academics for kids who wanted to study medicine, IT, business, and zoology, and then of course AP and IB classes along with the opportunity to take classes at the community college in our area. 

I too would highly reccomend taking college courses in high school. I have so many classes done that I won't have to take in college, which is really exciting, and they're FREE! 

The school I go to is one of the best public schools in the country, and I know there are many, many others that unfortunately are not that great. In that case, do whatever you can to get a great education! I just wanted to share my experience with going to a great public school:) ",2018-01-04 00:01:25
68afle,I Drew A Picture Of A Kid Getting Shot,"So, I'm a 9th Grader in a high school and just yesterday (Friday) there was an incident on the bus. It might not sound too crazy but I took it pretty seriously and things turned pretty dark..

Anyways, it was the end of the school day and everyone either went to the buses or car loop as usual. Like normal, I walked to my bus, however I decided to sit in the back seat because nobody was there yet. On my bus there weren't any assigned seats so this probably would've seemed normal. I had a snack and a juice pack at the time so I ate and drank until the bus was ready to depart. Although, the story starts here...

About a minute before the bus was getting ready to leave, I got up to throw my trash away. As I got to the trash can all the way in the front of the bus, a few more kids entered the bus. One of them was the kid who sits all the way in the back where I was. As a result, I told him that my stuff was back there so he should find somewhere else to go. He ignored me and kept walking to the back. I figured he would just grab my stuff and move it so I bolted after him. Should I mention, every time I sit back there are two people who always go to the same spot and kick me out the seat literally. Continuing on, he got to the seat and moved my stuff to the seat on front of him where my brother was. I was pretty tired of this so I grabbed him by the back and pulled him away. We had a mini fight of only pushing and shoving before he sat down. He was in the seat and I was in the middle of the aisle. The bus driver doesn't care about anything so that wasn't an issue. I kept asking the kid why I couldn't sit there but he ignored me. It just ticks me off that people act like this. After some more arguing one of my friends stood up for me and called him over. The kid moved to have a little ""talk"" in my friend's seat so I took the opportunity to claim my spot. Moments later he comes back and actually picks me up and throws me on top of my brother and onto the floor. Everyone laughed at me. 

I accepted defeat and sat with my brother in the inside next to the window. At the time I don't know why I did this, but I took a Post-It note out and began drawing. I drew one picture on the top half and another on the bottom half. The top picture showed a stick figure with the head colored(the kid is black) in and me pointing a gun at him. The bottom picture showed the black stick figure dead in a pool of blood. I only labeled the pictures with his name and the word ""me"" with arrows pointed at the characters. For no reason I then crumpled it up and threw it at somebody else. Unfortunately the paper ended up back to the kid who took my seat and he put it in his backpack. Now I'm pretty sure he's gonna report me and its just not fair. How bad will I get in trouble and how should I defend myself in front of the teachers?

55gc3e,My First School's Red Lockdown,"Been wanting to write this down for a while. The title says it all. It was just an average day at Rangeview High right after I got there by bus from Pickens Tech. It was my senior year and I was just asking questions to my former English teacher (don't remember her name, sadly) from Grade 9, just a friendly chat.

As soon I was about to leave, the announcer alert all facility a red lockdown. I used to have a orange or yellow lockdown from my previous schools but this lockdown is terrifying as there's a guy with a gun going near the neighborhood where the school is at.

Anyways, the English teacher immediately locked the door, turn off the lights, and let the other students hide in the corner of the wall. Mind you it was where the table is at so we literally have to make room under the table while some are on the outside edge of it. I was too busy staying calm, or trying to, and praying that gunman won't get inside the school. 

As I recover a bit, there's too much chattering between the students and their whispers started to get loud, complaining about the tight space, much to the teacher's dismay. When she told us to be quiet for the millionth time, she calls them out of their behavior, and asked this question (It's vague from what I remember so work with me here.)

""Do you what to get comfortable or alive?""

...And everyone, one by one, said ""Comfortable"" until I answered ""Alive...?"" They all looked at me and just laughed at the answer. I just stay to myself and ignore them. Once we got an ""All Clear"", her class resumed and I head out to my class later on.

I don't know what scares me the most, the fact this is my first Red Lockdown that could spell ""School Shooting"", or that the students think the situation is a big joke to them, like from a really bad teenage shows and movies...

Edit 1 - This happened from 2014, the year I graduated from high school.

3yxt4m,"How to Get a 4.0 GPA and Better Grades, by a Harvard alum","I've published a few guides that have been well received (like my [How to Get Into Harvard guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/37vwp2/how_to_get_into_harvard_and_the_ivy_league_by_a/)), and this is the latest in our series on succeeding in high school academics.

It's no surprise that a lot of high school students are stressed out by coursework and the demands of college applications. I now work with a lot of high school students around the country, and it's common to hear of unhappy students overloading on AP courses and sleeping way too late.

**The frustrating thing about classwork is that you can expend a lot of effort without obvious improvement.** Ever studied twice as hard for a test but gotten the same score? It can feel like pounding your head against the wall. Obviously it's very discouraging.

Consistently, I see that the biggest problems are with mindset, habits, and strategy. 

Students think it's impossible for them to improve on their weaknesses. Students aren't spending their time efficiently to get the most improvement for the least time. Students don't understand how teachers think and how to give teachers what they want. Students are wasting their time on classes they don't actually have to take, because they don't have to play the same game as everyone else.

**I've written a comprehensive guide with my complete set of strategies in how to excel in high school coursework.** I take you through three levels of detail, from top-down:

* **Mindset and Psychology**: Do you have the confidence to know you can improve with hard work? 
* **Overall Planning and Habits**: Do you get the most out of every hour? Do you understand what teachers care about, and how to give them what they want? Do you know how to combat procrastination?
* **Individual Class Strategies**: How should you be treating English and science classes differently? 

I learned a lot of these lessons the hard way, throughout high school and college. This is the guide I wish I had before starting high school.

There aren't any gimmicks or secret magic wands here. You'll have to work hard.

But instead of spending 1000 hours and getting nowhere, you might be able to spend 500 hours and make huge improvements. 

If you care about doing well in school and are willing to improve yourself, this guide will help.

2bir5z,"I'm going to High School, any general tips so I don't seem like an idiot?",Title says everything.,highschool,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/2bir5z/im_going_to_high_school_any_general_tips_so_i/,False,,17,"Besides the obvious thing like know your schedule and know your locker combination, there are several very easy conventions that I would recommend any freshman to follow.

##1) Don't make yourself the center of attention.
Unless you are answering a question or asking one, don't *try* to get everyone to notice you. The keyword there is try. Obviously you'll coincidentally become the center of attention when you do certain things, like go up to the board, but as a freshman you shouldn't be trying to get noticed by everyone. This means don't try to crack jokes hoping the whole class will laugh, etc. It just makes you seem annoying. People will notice you automatically if you just shut the fuck up and be yourself.

##2) Don't be too comfortable with other people to quickly.
I see a lot of freshman making quick encounters with upper classmen and expecting them to be like their best friend or something, and therefore act like they can boss them around. Or hang out with them 247. They become too comfortable with these upperclassmen (or just anyone in general) and try to dominate them. The key really is to just be nice to everyone you meet. Even those people you've known for a while. Eventually they'll let you in completely, for example they'll start approaching you and wanting to hang out with you. That's when you know you made some good friends.

##3) Engage in conversation when ever possible.
Obviously there is a right time and a wrong time to talk, but whenever you feel there is a time where you can converse with someone, you should try to. More specifically if someone starts talking to you, don't do the classic freshman move and get really quiet then answer with short quick replies. Open up! Have a smile on your face and just stay confident! It'll be hard, but just try to look like a nice guy! The last thing you want is for others to think you're hard to talk to

Follow those conventions, and you'll survive your freshman year with ease :) Be yourself, and treat everyone kindly! Remember, everything you do carries over to the rest of your 4 years, so make decisions that you'll be happy with in the longrun! ",2014-07-24 02:54:47

It'll help you find schools based on everything from your GPA and SAT score, to majors you want to study, to clubs you want to join and sports teams you want your school to have. There's an overview page which lets you see upcoming deadlines, match percentage, cost/financial aid, and chances.

There's also a calendar which will have any upcoming application deadlines, test deadlines or even personal deadlines you set. (My favorite feature since I know how overwhelming the whole process can get.)

Anyway, I hope you guys like it. Check it out, let me know if there's anything you guys think I should add or that you really like or even don't like.

I had no one to cry to but myself. This made me lack focus even more in my school work, and I started pretending to be sick so I didn't have to face anyone.

yoaf4,"As a Senior, this is my best piece of advice.","**GET. ORGANIZED.**

When I was a freshmen, I wasn't organized at all. All my stuff was all over the place. I suppose this came from middle school, where organization was hammered into our heads, and once I got to high school I figured I wouldn't need it anymore. Boy was I wrong. Needless to say, I had some trouble keeping up that year.

Then I discovered my holy grail of organization. My scanner. Every day, I would come home and scan in every single sheet of paper that I got at school that day. And I mean everything. Even those stupid scribble sheets from math class. I scanned it all. I shoved it into Evernote, because it would automatically make the text in the things searchable. I'm sure another solution would work the same.

ANYWAY. Once I was organized, and had everything I could ever need at my fingertips, my grades went up exponentially. My GPA is now a 96.0, which at my school is a 4.0. All because I got organized. 

**TL;DR**: Get organized. You cannot imagine how much it will help you.

g884v0,Did You Know: For high schoolers edition,"I've been thinking a lot about the world, and life in general. I'm not sure how many will listen, but this is for those in middle/high school. Going to slap a bit of my own weird but commonly true wisdoms at you. Anyone else older, please feel free to chime in.   


You may feel like you're stuck in the same day, over and over. Same friends, same family. But you're not. 

  
Things can/will change at the drop of a hat. Life-changing alterations.

 You're right that you probably won't use the shit they teach you in math class on a regular basis, unless you're trying to get into a field that needs it.

 You LIKELY won't know what you want to do for the rest of your life. 

If you can, take a year off after high school. Get a weird job, at least once in your life. 

Taxes may quickly become more complicated than you can do yourself, unless you're a tax expert. 

Virtually nobody is looking at you/thinking about you as much as you think they are.

 You and your closest friends may/will probably drift apart, no matter how close you are now. You WILL continue to change, as a person... your interests, possibly your sexuality. 

If you have the opportunity, LEARN HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE/YOUR OIL. You're not likely to make nearly as much money as you thought you would.

You really will realize how much your parents did for your out of love, even if it came through as unfairness/anger at the time.

People are way more fucked up emotionally/mentally than you realize. 

Making appointments is often scary. Going to them is scarier.  


Your body will probably start hurting in ways you never even imagined. 24 years old? Sit wrong? Welcome to not being able to get out of bed for a day. Break a bone? Gone are the days of quick healing. 

Depression becomes SUPER FUCKING REAL, but it won't be like you imagined it. You'll feel tired. You'll low key hate your life. You'll start rejecting calls, texts, visits. Even from your best friend.

Infatuation/love may not last forever, and if it lasts, that person will likely change. Not always for the best. Also, that person may be you. Change can be healthy and fine.

Breaking up is painful, but like any growth, it can be necessary.  


Unexpected costs WILL COME UP. Sometimes to the tune of millions. Have a pet? Have a car? Yeah.

Your childhood trauma is VALID AS FUCK and it WILL/CAN have an effect well into your life. Therapy is not something to be mocked. It can make an enormous difference in how you feel/function.

Your 10 year high school reunion is closer than you think.   


The bullies in your life tend to be shit after you graduate. 

There's a BIG BIG CHANCE your fetish/sexual is perfectly normal, and there's  A SAFE WAY TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

As a follow up, sex toys are healthy and normal, but please go to a reputable company to purchase from. Sexuality is as important as virtually any other health issue. There ARE amazing, professional folks out there who are VERY knowledgeable about bodies and toys. It can be hard to flush the blush, but do it. It'll be worth it.  


Ask for a second opinion. If you're REALLY worried about a health issue, look elsewhere. You owe it to yourself to find a doctor that will listen and really do their work for you. You have one body.  


Addiction is a whole beast. As an addict, I can promise you I understand that asking for help is hard. Even understanding when you have an issue can be difficult. You ARE loved, and you are not disposable. If talking about this is hard, there are many online/text help venues for you.  


  
Suicide. I revert to the above statements, but they may or may not resonate. If you're a high school student struggling with suicide/ideation, please read this. You may have heard this tons before, but high school is not forever. The other students in your life are not in your life forever. They don't make you, so don't let them break you. There IS a place for you in this world, and you have immense capacity, no matter how you feel, how you look, no matter what you like. People tend to attack what they feel threatened by. I'm currently almost 20 years in mourning a sort-of friend who committed suicide, and it has shaped my entire life.  


In conclusion, you FUCKING GO, guy/girl/other. There IS a space for you in this world. It may be difficult to find, but I promise.",highschool,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/g884v0/did_you_know_for_high_schoolers_edition/,False,,0,,2020-04-26 12:33:26

es4231,How to make friends(again),"hey,
just wanted some advice on how to make friends again. I started high school in grade 8(Canada) and was kinda popular cuz I knew everyone and got invited to everything. In grade 10, I kinda got hit with some personal family matters which eventually made me very anxious and depressed all the time. Fast forward to this year in grade 11 I really only have one friend(maybe) and all my other ‚Äòfriends‚Äô have separated into different cliques(stoners,jocks etc.). I have found it quite difficult to rekindle any pre existing friendships I‚Äôve had and feel like everyone looks at me oddly. Any advice?",highschool,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/es4231/how_to_make_friendsagain/,False,,2,"Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone, got to school events, ask your old friends to go with you. One of my best friends was not a friend at all until I asked them to play badminton 10/10 would recommend.  Ask people to get food after school, ask them to go shopping, hiking, the movies, the park. Anything. Any step you make towards friendship will generally be taken positively, and if not then you have more time to devote to your other friends. You don't even have to do a lot, sitting with a person during lunch, inviting them into a card game, it can make giant leaps. ",2020-01-22 08:40:50

ebo42n,Missing alot of school because of mental health issues.,"Ive been missing alot of school days to the point my teachers are starting to dislike me. I get decent grades even though i dont attent alot of classes, but i just have 0 motivation to attend highschool.

I have anxiety because not only do half the teachers dislike me for a reason unknown, but i just get a crap ton of anxiety by just walking or seeing the building. But today i tried my best to go a whole day but ended up going home. Before i went home my art teacher's mood completely dropped and stared me down when i said that im feeling extremly nauseous, now i dont want to even show up to her class.

Im not sure what to do or how to survive or give myself motivation to keep going. It started freshmen year, i got diagnosed with depression and just stopped caring about showing up. I dont even have many goals anymore for my future. My parents always tell me its not worth going to college, its too much money and my teachers seem to always make me feel really shitty about how i learn slower than others. 

My family doesnt believe me when i tell them im feeling depressed and want help. They tell me that i have no reason to feel depressed and that i have everything i want. I feel alone and trapped. And idk what to do.

 Ive been working my ass off studying for tests cause i know im awful with tests and want good marks and been putting alot of time in my projects even though i dont show up to school much, i still do all my work and get great marks on everything, but my teachers and family still make me feel like i dont do enough. Always telling me im lazy and dont do anything and its degrading and its making me not want to do anything anymore.

Im stuck",highschool,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/ebo42n/missing_alot_of_school_because_of_mental_health/,False,,17,"Hi there, I saw your cosplay post and went to your profile to see if you had any other xayah posts and found this instead. 

I'm so sorry that you're going through this. It's  really hard and tough to deal with. I also dealt with really bad anxiety and depression in high school (it's still there but not as bad). I want you to know that things will eventually get better, and you **are** doing enough; you're actually doing great with the obstacles that you're facing if you're doing your work and getting good marks. 

My advice is to talk about this with your school counselor. It's their job! I know it may seem intimidating, but it can really make a difference. 

When I was in high school, things were ""bad enough"" that they made me see a professional therapist that came to the school  each week. It turned out to be great for me and he really helped me get through my senior year. Maybe your school has a similar program that your counselor can get you started with? Either way, start out with talking to your counselor and basically telling them what you've said here. They should have resources that will help and can help you come up with a course of  action. 

I would also suggest talking to your teachers about what's going on, or at least one if you have if you have one you feel you can trust. Hopefully they will be understanding and can help you figure out how to talk to your other teachers. 

Sorry that your family is acting that way, and your teachers. Everyone learns differently, but that doesn't make you dumber or less worthy than anyone else. It just means that you're putting in more effort to get the good marks you're getting than those who don't study to get by. That's a good thing -- it means you will be more prepared for the studying that college will require, if you want to go. 

As for college, don't let what your parents are saying  about it get to you (easier said than done). College is worth It, definitely. They are right that it is outrageously expensive (at least in the US). Starting out at a community college and then transferring to a four year institution can be a good path, just make sure the community college amd four year program have some sort of corresponding courses or course agreement so that your credits will transfer over. Start looking and applying for all the scholarships you can now if you are past sophomore year. There is a scholarship subreddit that may be useful. All of this is something that your school counselor will be able to help with as well. 

Sorry again that you're going through this. I'm really proud of you for doing what you've been able to and for reaching out here for help. I'm always available if you need more help on this. 

Great cosplay btw! From what I can tell, you really have a great talent for that! ",2019-12-17 08:44:05

boug8f,What was your Freshman year like?,"Luckily, I graduated high school back in 2015 and I'm glad. Didn't like the teachers and I didn't like my peers either for the most part. Since I'm having PTSD flashbacks to those years, I thought I'd get rid of them by posting what mostly happened during that period on here.

2011-2012 Freshman Year: Oh boy, I think Freshman was the worst year for me. I had just changed schools and I was the new kid. I stood out HORRIBLY like a thumb that had been raped a goblin. Especially in gym class. Most of the boys were tall, athletic and loved sports. I was only 5'9, scrawny, clumsy and did not give a crap about sports. I remember if we had dodgeball, I would pick up IMAGINARY balls and pretend to throw it at other people when really I was just throwing air. The guys would be like ""WTF ARE YOU DOING?"".

I also just had a reputation of being an awkwardly funny guy. One time during intervention, this one guy tried pantsing me and I said in a high pitched voice ""WHOOO! OH BABY! YEAH!"". He got so embarrassed that he ended up not pantsing me. The whole class erupted in laughter. Seemed like I hardly ever failed at making people laugh. Despite this, I didn't really have any friends. One girl said to me that the others would tell her to stay away from me because I was ""really weird"". 

I also did really poor in school work in general. I had no interest in hardly any of the subjects, so I'd be either day dreaming, singing ""Believe"" by Cher, or acting like Curly from the Three Stooges from to time to time. I know talking about my antics makes me sound like I was outgoing but I was actually very quiet and introverted about 70% of the time. That's the thing, I was either acting out or I was a complete loner behind the shadows. Second semester was at least a little better than the previous. Especially reading class because sometimes we would perform plays from literature. We did this cool roleplay as if Zaroff from The Most Dangerous Game had to go to court and I was Zaroff. Everyone screamed and laughed when I was that character having an emotional breakdown trying to kill the judge and shoot everyone. After that, everyone told me that I should be an actor. 

Despite that, I was actually really shy when people tried actually talking to me. Ya know, like a real conversation. During that time, I was so stoic and distant from people that I knew no one knew how depressed I was. It's kind of hard to explain but I felt like I was legitimately mentally retarded. That could explain why I didn't even want to actually be friends with people. I didn't want them to think ""OMG, this kid is so dumb"". Now a days, I really don't care if I'm stupid but back in 2011 and 2012, I would often have flashbacks to when I did something unintentionally idiotic and I would feel horrible about it.",highschool,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/boug8f/what_was_your_freshman_year_like/,False,,8,"As a current freshman, this year was bad.

ahxzio,My Magnum Opus," 

I wrote this for my creative writing class. 

  God Is A Lizard  

Not many people were like M‚Äôgeku M‚Äôbake. He was kind of a living conundrum. To begin with he had a name like M‚Äôgeku M‚Äôbake and he was of Polish descent. He hoped to become a famous movie critic one day but his favorite movie was *Little Nicky*. He even wore daisy dukes, which he said he wore ironically but really it was because he just felt like a free man in dukes. He was a being of pure trash. It wasn‚Äôt too out of the ordinary then to expect him to get into a situation such as this.

M‚Äôgeku was on a field trip to New York with his class over the summer. His teacher, Mr. Snout, had let all the kids out on their own for a little bit. He just went back to his hotel room, drank about 5 bottles of Smirnoff, and slept while all 30 of his students wandered the streets of New York, unaccompanied by any sort of adult.

M‚Äôgeku went on his own as usual. He was a very lonely boy due to his many eccentricities. In fact, his school had voted him most weird three years in a row, and everytime M‚Äôgeku had to walk up on stage and receive the award from his cackling principal. It was quite rude but that‚Äôs school, ya know? Sometimes your own principal laughs at your absurdity.

M‚Äôgeku first stopped at a Seven Eleven where he bought some sushi. Gas stations were always M‚Äôgeku‚Äôs favorite kind of place to get sushi. He was walking along the street, eating his sushi, and thinking about why bees should run the Ohio government (bees are very good at that sort of thing due to their enhanced productivity during summers). M‚Äôgeku was thinking so heavily about this subject that he wasn‚Äôt exactly paying attention to where he was going, and he fell into one of Manhattan‚Äôs many open manholes.

M‚Äôgeku got up from the filth and sludge that created a foot high river going through the sewage system. He was okay, but the hole above him was much too high to jump to now and there was no ladder in sight.

‚ÄúAight,‚Äù said M‚Äôgeku. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in worse sewer related situations. Remember mom‚Äôs 80th birthday party M‚Äôgeku? Now that was interesting.‚Äù

A low growl broke out from the silence of the sewer, and soon turned into three growls. Those growls turned into a snap, and then, into three snaps. Out of the shadows, emerged three alligators, snapping in a musical-like unison. The alligator that seemed to lead the group abruptly rose his arm in an L with a closed fist. This motion silenced the other reptile‚Äôs snapping. Each alligator was wearing a hat. The two on the leader‚Äôs side were wearing a backwards baseball cap and a fedora. The leader was wearing Mickey-Mouse ears, the kind you‚Äôd get on a summer vacation to Disney. The Leader spoke.

‚ÄúEvening moresel. The name‚Äôs Lafayette.‚Äù He pointed to the fedora gator. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dwayne,‚Äù Lafayette then pointed at the baseball cap beast, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs Dwayne. Now, what would bring a little morsel like you down to the territory of our gang, The Respectable Gentlemen?‚Äù

‚ÄúRespectable Gentlemen?‚Äù inquired M‚Äôgeku.

‚ÄúYes Morsel, because of our most fancy hats.‚Äù M‚Äôgeku looked at each of the alligators hats. The only thing even close to a respectable cap was Dwayne‚Äôs fedora, but even that hat didn‚Äôt look too fancy. The rim of the fedora had salsa oozing over the edge. 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ respectable‚Ä¶.  Look, I‚Äôm sure you are some fine reptiles, but I must get going back to‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHold up morsel, you‚Äôre on our territory now. You abide to our rules.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku scrunched his eyebrows. 

‚ÄúDude, could you please like not call me morsel. You sound like a sexual predator or sumthin.‚Äù

Lafayette‚Äôs reptilian brow raised in contrast to M‚Äôgeku‚Äôs.

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ What do you mean? Just because I say morsel doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm like a sexual predator.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creepy dude.‚Äù

Lafayette seemed even more distraught now.

‚ÄúWhat? No‚Ä¶shut up! You‚Ä¶. you‚Ä¶.just shut up okay! It‚Äôs not creepy it‚Äôs like intimidating and cool and stuff.‚Äù

Lafayette seemed like he was on the verge of crying now.

‚ÄúYou know what buddy? You‚Ä¶ you shut up!,‚Äù Lafayette cried.

Lafayette shoved M‚Äôgeku to the ground. His head bashed against a sewer stone, leaving him lying there, cold and dead. Lafayette just stood there, his mouth gaping wide open.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶...sorry, that was an oopsie on my part.‚Äù

.       .        .

M‚Äôgeku awoke in an area that was partially familiar. He felt cold tile floor on his cheek. Crumbs from fried foods surrounded him and lights from tacky neon signs shone above. The whole place smelled‚Ä¶ good. Like a warm appetizer served just before a filling and satisfying meal. That was when M‚Äôgeku realized, he was in a Red Robin. 

‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶ good. I‚Äôm a fan of RR.‚Äù 

M‚Äôgeku analyzed his surroundings. He looked outside one of the thumb-print stained windows to find many more Red Robins resting atop a layer of clouds. 

‚ÄúOkay I think I‚Äôm catchin‚Äô this drift right now. Red Robin is heaven! I mean, it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt know that already, but still, suspicions confirmed.‚Äù

The lights dimmed, except for one, that held over a booth in the corner of the restaurant. M‚Äôgeku cautiously strode toward the booth. On the table were a basket of pretzel balls with cheese, a glass of Dr. Pepper, and another basket with fries with ketchup, and chicken tenders with ranch. M‚Äôgeku slid into the booth. Once M‚Äôgeku settled down, a being appeared across from him. The being had the head of a Basilisk lizard, but the body of an adult middle-aged fit man. The being was draped in white robes that seemed to shine off their own form of natural light.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù said the being in a casual voice. ‚ÄúI am God.‚Äù

God took a fry, dipped it in ketchup, and bit down on it.

‚ÄúAny questions?‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku slouched in his seat in immense disbelief. ‚ÄúUH, YEAH I GOTTA COUPLE.‚ÄùGod just shrugged. 

‚ÄúM‚Äôkay. What‚Äôcha got?‚Äù

‚Äú...Is this heaven?‚Äù God sighed, and nodded.

‚ÄúYes M‚Äôbakey, this is heaven.‚Äù M‚Äôgeku rolled his eyes.

‚ÄúSir, my name is M‚Äôgeku.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! Sorry, bud. My name scales have dried up lately.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour...name scales?,‚Äù M‚Äôgeku inquired.

‚ÄúYes M‚Äôfreaky, I have a scale on my head for every major function I need to perform. It seems that my name scale has gotten a little dry and isn‚Äôt functioning correctly.‚Äù

God grabbed the Dr. Pepper and splashed his face with the soft drink.

‚ÄúMuch better.‚Äù

‚ÄúSooooo, ummm, do you visit every guy that comes up here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWelllll i‚Äôm supposed to, but it gets a little repetitive, so now I have my secretary take care of that mostly. Her name‚Äôs Linda: Queen Of A Thousand Mouths.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶. nice,‚Äù stuttered M‚Äôgeku.

‚ÄúNot really. Now I bet you‚Äôre probably wondering why I visited you of all people. Well, that‚Äôs cause I need your help. You see, you weren‚Äôt aware at the time, but the whole time while you were alive, Satan had been syphoning off of your trashiness.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku wasn‚Äôt really surprised.

‚ÄúI knew someone had been sucking on my right upper thigh every night!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo actually, that was your neighbor. But I digress, Satan has been using your trash energy to power his Greaseometer. A device that will turn every restaurant in America into a‚Ä¶ Golden Corral.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku gasped. 

‚ÄúMy God.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sorry not you.‚Äù 

God started to tear up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a horrifying revelation, I know, but I need your help to destroy his immense ultimate evil trashiness of Golden Corral with your own trashiness abilities. I think it should work. Ya know, like a double negative or sumthin‚Äô.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku shrugged. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll work, but I‚Äôm down to destroy a Golden Corral any day.‚Äù

God raised from his seat.

‚ÄúThen it is done. We shall gather our allies now. LINDA! CAN I GET A RIDE?‚Äù

Out of the blue, a pair of large red lips condensated onto a wall in the restaurant. The lips opened up and laid a tounge out onto the ground. An old woman with gray curly hair and a pair of large red lips. She was wearing a green pencil skirt with a green suit and shoulder pads. 

‚ÄúWhaddaya want ya reptilian rat roach.‚Äù

God frowned.

‚ÄúThank you Linda. Now can we please get a ride?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, whatever. I‚Äôm calling up the French Horn right now.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku turned his head to the side curiously.

‚ÄúThe French Horn?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Linda groaned in a hoarse voice. ‚ÄúOne night I snorted like 10 packs of Smarties and bought a giant flying french horn off of Brian.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian. Anyways, it‚Äôs powered off of the souls of the damned so every second it moves it toots, but every toot is an agonizing scream from someone in Hell. It‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds.‚Äù

It was though. While they rode over a sea of Red Robins on top of the horn, M‚Äôgeku heard a constant stream of musical screams each creating a beautiful yet haunting melody. 

‚ÄúHey, Linda,‚Äù M‚Äôgeku yelled. ‚ÄúIs there any way we can possibly turn down the screams so this ride is less existentially terrifying?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù she retorted.

She just sat there continuing to drive the airborne instrument.

‚ÄúCan you like‚Ä¶. do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

‚Äú...Okay then‚Ä¶..‚Äù 

She didn‚Äôt. 

They arrived at a clearing where the clouds slowly turned into the green of grass and forest. Linda landed the ship onto a hill that overlooked a large plain with a large pair of human lips on the ground in the distance, where thousands of different people, creatures and beasts of many sizes and shapes waited for God and M‚Äôgeku.

As they were figuring out how to get off the horn, M‚Äôgeku asked Linda another question (as M‚Äôgeku does).

‚ÄúHey Linda,‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúHow come they call you the Queen Of A Thousand Mouths?‚Äù

Linda turned her head.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ God said you were The Queen Of A Thousand Mouths.‚Äù

Linda looked angry now.

‚ÄúThat scaly little skank. After this he‚Äôs gonna get a whooping so hard he‚Äôll have to make an eleventh commandment just for me.

God floated gracefully off of the Horn, his presence silencing the last mutterings of anyone in the crowd.

‚ÄúGood afternoon,‚Äù he boomed, his voice seeming more deep and commanding now. ‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôve all been informed of our current situation which is most dire. Satan now poses a threat to quality dining around the globe. If we cannot stop Him, I fear for the worst. Riots, War, and, worst of all, food that is just far too greasy to be edible. I have called upon the majority of the people from our kingdom, such as the Christians, the Muslims, the Jews, and most importantly the Teeth people.‚Äù

A group of white specks in the distance cheered. 

‚ÄúSo I ask upon all of you, will you fight for freedom, dignity, and fine dining?‚Äù

The whole crowd roared yes.

‚ÄúThen we shall go to Hell, and destroy the Greaseometer for the glory of heaven and red robin.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHUZZAH!,‚Äù yelled the crowd.

‚ÄúGo into the mouth portal Linda has created for you and dive into the depths of Hell so we can show Satan we‚Äôre not afraid. Go my sons! Go!‚Äù

And with that command the crowd started to disperse and jump down into the now open pair of lips. God took M‚Äôgeku by the hand and flew him over to the teeth people. They were beings that resembled large teeth with scarily human faces and twig-like arms and legs. M‚Äôgeku noticed that their mouths were all gum and no teeth. This sent chills down his spine.

‚ÄúM‚Äôgeku,‚Äù God said. ‚ÄúI have to go lead the troops, but I am leaving you in good hands. This is Cavatony,‚Äù God pointed at a tooth person with a cardboard Burger King crown resting upon their head. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll guide you in battle and help you to channel your trash energy to destroy the Greaseometer. I must go now, but I am always with you.‚Äù

God licked M‚Äôgeku‚Äôs forehead with his forked tongue, and floated down into the mouth. M‚ÄôGeku ran over to Cavatony. 

‚ÄúHey, uh I‚Äôm M‚Äôgeku. God sent me over to you.‚Äù

Cavatony turned around and faced M‚Äôgeku. It was quite unusual seeing a human face on a tooth. Cavatony had a cartoonish frown that appeared to showcase every muscle on his face. 

‚ÄúYeah, I know, ya fleshsack.‚Äù

Okay, thought M‚Äôgeku. It would be nice if people could stop calling me unnerving nicknames.

‚ÄúOkay, then what‚Äôs our first course of action?‚Äù

Cavatony grinned a long gummy smile.

‚ÄúWhy, collect our arsenal of course.‚Äù 

A taco truck pulled up next to them. A sign on the truck said Marvin‚Äôs Milk Shack. A short bald man with hair on the sides of his head leaned on the counter of the truck with his head resting in his hand.

M‚Äôgeku jokingly said, ‚ÄúHey, so you must be Marvin.‚Äù

The man stood up in the truck. M‚Äôgeku could notice the man‚Äôs eyes starting to water.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever say that name again you hear me punk?,‚Äù the man sobbed.

‚ÄúWha‚Ä¶ what did I do‚Ä¶‚Äù

Cavatony walked up and placed his hand around M‚Äôgeku‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúSorry Clark, the kid‚Äôs a newbie. He doesn‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet that flesh sack outta my sight,‚Äù Clark said as he wiped the tears from his eyes.

Cavatony turned to M‚Äôgeku.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you wait over there while I talk this out,‚Äù he said as he pointed over to a small patch of dirt in the grass.

M‚Äôgeku waited for a few minutes as Cavatony walked over to him with two guns that looked like they were from some alien invader Nerf gun toy line. Cavatony threw the smaller pistol looking one to M‚Äôgeku. It was much lighter than he thought it would be and glowed a lime green.

‚ÄúThat one you got right there M‚Äôgeku, that‚Äôs an airline food 3000. It has no safety so you can just shoot it wheneva. Go ahead, aim it towards the sky.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku did as he was told and fired the gun upward. Instead of a laser blast or a bullet, a dark rectangular object shot out at a high speed.

‚ÄúHey Cavatony,‚Äù said M‚Äôgeku. ‚ÄúWhat does this thing shoot anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis one shoots Seinfeld season 4 dvds. Not Blu rays though. That‚Äôd be just cruel.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku didn‚Äôt question it. This was by far the sanest thing he‚Äôd seen all day.

‚ÄúAlright then, let‚Äôs go down the mouth,‚Äù and with that Cavatony grabbed M‚Äôgeku by the shirt collar and ran down a hill to where the lips in the ground were.

‚ÄúHold on to your fillings,‚Äù he yelled, and they jumped down the hole.

. . .

They landed immediately after they jumped and M‚Äôgeku knew exactly where they were. This environment had even been his home for a few years. They were at a Walmart. This was different than a regular Walmart because it was vast and long, but also a ceiling that was just an inch too short so you had to bend your neck to fit. This was the same for anyone of any height because of some kind of torture demon magic, or at least that‚Äôs what M‚Äôgeku figured.

Wow, M‚Äôgeku thought. Now that‚Äôs good torture: ceilings that are just too short.

Far ahead, M‚Äôgeku and Cavatony saw a battle raging on. Religious followers and Teeth people fought against Demons (who all took the form of U.S. senator Ted Cruz) in a violent war. It was all a bit underwhelming though because everyone had to bend their heads a little as they thrashed their swords and shot their guns at one another.

‚ÄúOver there!,‚Äù Cavatony yelled while pointing in the distance. 

There was a large bull made of gold standing straight up on its hind legs. The Demons were defending it with their lives. M‚Äôgeku knew this had to be the Greaseometer. 

Cavatony held on to M‚Äôgeku‚Äôs wrist and pulled him through the battlefield. 

‚ÄúFire your weapon soldier!,‚Äù Cavatony screamed.

M‚Äôgeku held down the trigger to his gun and shot as many Demons as he could. He may or may not have hit a few of the good guys too.

M‚Äôgeku felt Cavatony lose his grip on him. M‚Äôgkeu turned to find a demonic Ted Cruz holding on to the ankle of Cavatony.

‚ÄúYou wanna hear my Jay Leno impression?,‚Äù screeched the demon. The Ted Being adjusted his voice to sound vaguely like Jay Leno. ‚ÄúSo, ah, President Obama called me. He said, ‚ÄòJay if you like your job you can keep it.‚Äô‚Äù  It wasn‚Äôt a very good impression. 

Cavatony kicked the Ted off, but more Teds began to approach.

‚ÄúSave yourself soldier! Go destroy the Greaseometer! Just channel your inner trashiness! You‚Äôll know what to do! GO!‚Äù

Cavatony was swarmed by Teds. M‚Äôgeku ran in fear. He shot incoming Teds while racing towards the golden calf. As he reached the statue however, a voice slithered into his ear. It sounded like‚Ä¶ Eddie Murphy. No, late nineties Eddie Murphy.

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôve come to destroy my creation?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you? Come out here and show yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh you know very well who I am M‚Äôgeku.‚Äù 

A short snake like figure emerged from behind the statue. It was Mushu, the dragon sidekick from the Disney adaptation of Mulan. 

‚ÄúI am Satan.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? But‚Ä¶ why Mushu?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause M‚Äôgeku, he is the worst part to a fantastic movie. He is the comedy relief that doesn‚Äôt work. He is a vessel of hatred and evil.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku shrugged.

‚ÄúWell I guess that kinda makes sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd see my point of view M‚Äôgeku, which is why I wanted you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you wanted me here? What‚Äôs your game Satan?‚Äù

Satan sighed.

‚ÄúOh M‚Äôgeku, you and your questions. You see, I‚Äôm really the one that brought you here. I knew that you, being the trashiest person in this dimension could be the only one to power such a mighty device. After leeching off your energy for a while I realized that the only way to fully power my device was to bring you here to power it in person, but I was also aware that God was the only one who could bring a premature death unaided by a ritual. So, I planted subliminal messages all around God to get him to bring you here.  For instance, I put up billboards on the route God takes to work every morning that said, ‚ÄòMaybe M‚Äôgeku‚Äôs the key. Think about that sweetie.‚Äô,  and then one day I whispered in his ear, ‚ÄòBring M‚Äôgeku to hell it‚Äôs such a good idea that you have now come up with.‚Äô‚Äù He never suspected a thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought subliminal messaging was supposed to be subtle,‚Äù inquired M‚Äôgeku.

‚ÄúThat WAS subtle. Pretty genius of me huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúA giant billboard stating your master plan is not subtle.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell it worked. That‚Äôs what really counts right? None of this even really mattered anyway. While I was monologuing to you I had one of my Demons draining the last bit of energy I needed from you.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku looked down and Ted Cruz was sucking on his thigh.

‚ÄúGet off!,‚Äù M‚Äôgeku yelled as he kicked the demon.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to join me, M‚Äôgeku,‚Äù sneered Satan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already got what I needed. It would be nice though to have a partner in crime. So whatdayya say kid? It‚Äôs not like anyone ever appreciated you in the first place. Not your friends, not your teachers, not your mother who left you, not even God.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku thought about what Satan said. He did have a point. No one ever really cared about him, they all just used him. He was just part of god‚Äôs scheme. But this wasn‚Äôt how he wanted to get respect. He didn‚Äôt want people‚Äôs fear, he wanted their love. He wasn‚Äôt going to find love through Satan, he at least knew that much.

‚ÄúNo Satan, I may be trashy, but I‚Äôm not so cruel as to turn every restaurant in the world into a dumpster fire of grease.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile you just thought about it I already turned the machine on.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku gasped. He looked above the Mushu vessel to find that the bull‚Äôs mouth was open, with a blue beam emerging from its mouth. 

. . .

God could sense the imbalance. People all around the world were horrified to learn that their favorite culinary establishments had been turned into disgusting deep fried buffet buildings. As people ate at Big Boy, their food turned into the greasy mush that was considered a standard for Golden Corral. Greasiness would become the norm in this new world. No hospitality to customers, no decent service, and more importantly, no food with heart. In time, people would simply just get used to all of this, which is the most horrifying thing of all. People would just accept these horrors plaguing their nights of dining out. These messy mounds of brick and stone would be considered places of fine eatery for the public. The population would become nothing but mere food vacuums, eating whatever was put in a metal buffet tin for them.  Satan must have gotten his Grease algorithm a little wrong though because the Golden Corrals that already existed had another Golden Corral appear on top of them in a disjointed manner. This was the end. This was Hell.

. . .

‚ÄúYou monster!‚Äù yelled M‚Äôgeku. 

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù replied Satan.

What am I going to do, thought M‚Äôgeku. This is the end. It can‚Äôt be fixed. All of got left is my daisy dukes and my trashiness. Wait‚Ä¶

‚ÄúMy trashiness‚Ä¶,‚Äù M‚Äôgeku whispered to himself.

‚ÄúWhaddidya say kid?‚Äù

‚ÄúMY TRASHINESS,‚Äù roared M‚Äôgeku.

M‚Äôgeku glowed a putrid yellow along with his eyes. His hair flew in a sudden wind. The short ceiling blew out from above him. He started to rise from the ground and floated above Satan.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ how?,‚Äù Satan whined. 

‚ÄúI am a being of pure trash and I have come to Hell. Of course I have power in this domain.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt matter either. I‚Äôm Satan. I have power in this domain too!‚ÄùMushu grew to the human size of M‚Äôgeku and glowed a dark red.

‚ÄúYou wanna play trashy M‚Äôgeku? Let‚Äôs play trashy.‚Äù

Out of nowhere Led Zepplin‚Äôs Immigrant song began to echo throughout the Walmart. Mushu grabbed M‚Äôgeku and lifted him up through a hole in the ceiling. They entered a large opening in Hell that had a variety of caverns and dark red flesh like walls surrounding them. Mushu threw M‚Äôgeku into one of those walls.

‚ÄúHeh, really kid? You think you can beat Satan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can. I believe I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like, the same thing.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWho cares? Eat trash.‚Äù M‚Äôgeku blasted Satan with a ray of Planet Sheen dvds.

‚ÄúNO‚Äù, yelled Satan. ‚ÄúNot the 2010-2013 Nickelodeon spin off of Jimmy Neutron! YOU‚ÄôLL PAY FOR‚Ä¶‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku blasted Satan with Planet Sheen DVDs.

‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôLL PAY‚Ä¶‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku blasted Satan with Planet Sheen DVDs.

‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôLL‚Ä¶‚Äù 

M‚Äôgeku blasted Satan with Planet Sheen DVDs.

‚ÄúSTOP‚Ä¶‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku blasted Satan with Planet Sheen DVDs. Satan was under a pile of Planet Sheen dvds. He wasn‚Äôt making a sound.

‚ÄúThat oughtta hold him for a while.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku flew back into the Walmart and landed in front of the Greaseometer.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give this bull a little more trash than it can handle.‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku blasted the bull with a beam of trashiness. The bull began to shake and rattle, until it let out one final heartbreaking moo and exploded into a million greasy pieces. The battle stopped and the blessed ones and the Teds all looked up to see the golden explosion. Satan crawled out from the dvd pile.

‚ÄúNO! Well, you think you‚Äôve solved your issue just by destroying the calf? Your precious restaurants are all still Golden Corrals, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it!‚Äù

God flew over to Satan and M‚Äôgeku.

‚ÄúActually, you might just be wrong about that.‚Äù

. . .

‚ÄúDamnit,‚Äù said Linda. ‚ÄúWhy are all these instructions in Korean?‚Äù

Linda was back in heaven and stood before a large ruby bird statue with its head pointed toward the sky. She was holding an instruction manual for the device. Famous actor Danny Devito stood next to her.

‚ÄúAh, here we are,‚Äù she said.

Linda pressed a panel on the robin which opened up a small opening in the statue the size of a hand.

‚ÄúNow, what exactly is it that you want me to do here lady?,‚Äù said Danny.

‚ÄúJust stick ya hand in there sweetie. The machine‚Äôs just gonna use some of your holy essence to power it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhadevva ya say lady.‚Äù

Danny stuck his hand into the machine. It glowed bright red. The beak of the bird opened and shot out a bright white beam into the sky.

. . .

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù whined Satan. ‚ÄúI can feel it. All the restaurants are turning normal again and all the Golden Corrals are turning into Red Robins!‚Äù

‚ÄúAs it should be,‚Äù said God. ‚ÄúLooks like I get to serve first this week.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean serve first?‚Äù asked M‚Äôgeku.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Satan said. ‚ÄúWhenever we have one of these holy wars whoever wins gets to serve first in our Sunday tennis match.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever had to serve second,‚Äù God chimed in.

‚ÄúShut up you holy heffer.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù said God, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been fun, but you should be getting back to your field trip now M‚Äôgeku. Don‚Äôt worry, in real time only 2 minutes has passed and yes, Mr. Snout is still passed out on a hotel couch currently so you‚Äôre good. I don‚Äôt think this‚Äôll be the last time we meet though M‚Äôgeku.‚Äù

God licked M‚Äôgeku with his forked tongue once again.

‚ÄúI hope to see you again my son.‚Äù

God snapped and everything turned white.

. . .

M‚Äôgeku was in a dress and a sun hat. He was sitting at a tea table in the sewers with the three Respectable Gentlemen in similar attire. They were pouring him a cup of tea when M‚Äôgeku suddenly woke up.

‚ÄúWha‚Ä¶‚Äù

M‚Äôgeku looked at his surroundings and Lafayette‚Äôs mouth was agape

‚Äú......................................More tea?‚Äù

You just need to be yourself, show the good side of your qualities. I don't really want a gf rn, but if you sit next to or in a group with one, try to subtly find out their interests by talking. If you like a show and they come to school wearing that shirt, engage them and don't be shy. Or if you saw a movie in a franchise or biopic about a band (like Bohemian Rhapsody) ask if they've seen it. Just subtle ways to get contact info in order to elaborate on those shared interest. If you ask a girl out and she says no, don't ignore her. Still be friends as she might develop feelings towards you. If you follow her on instagram, do a slight scroll for anything you have in common or that you don't like about her. With social media, you can tell a lot about someone. Just don't learn the intimates of their life stories, save that for conversations. Use ig as a foundation to build a relationship off of, by finding common interests. ",2018-11-30 12:55:56
9eafss,Think carefully about college and major choices...,"Some two thirds of young people attend college. Many drop out or finish only two-year programs, but 4 in 10 Millennials have a bachelor degree. Of these, the single most popular major is Psychology at about 1 in 15, while the Visual and Performing Arts fields graduate 1 in 17.

How does that translate into a job market where half of new graduates work at jobs that do not require a college degree, and most majors compete for the SAME entry level office jobs? Not very well, especially considering the demand for knowledge work peaked back in the year 2000.

There are numerous college graduates who work as baristas, Uber drivers, waiters, Amazon warehouse pickers, pizza delivery drivers, etc. Each owes tens of thousands... to over one hundred of thousand. Default rates within the first 5 years for borrowers is around 1 in 4.",highschool,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/9eafss/think_carefully_about_college_and_major_choices/,False,,1,"This can be good advice, but I also want to add that there is A LOT of nuance that should be discussed here. 

Many people who attain undergraduate degrees simply go to college to get a degree. This can lead to a lot of people getting similarly attractive degrees, however, with less motivation.

For example, OP brought up the major of Psychology as a popular example. Yes, a lot of people study psychology, but this shouldn't dissuade everyone who is considering majoring in psychology.

In undergrad, it's important to think about what kind of career you might want to take and what steps you would need to make that career possible for you. If you want a psychology degree, why? Are you trying to become a practicing psychologist, do you want to be a professor, do you want to work with kids and developmental psychology?

These would all be questions you should ask yourself and posit different paths you should take in your undergraduate career, but they may also rely on a background of an undergraduate degree in psychology.

It's also important to note that yes, you may study something that isn't all that helpful in undergrad, but many many people than apply to graduate school for completely different things. More often than not, undergraduate degrees end up meaning less for your career path than you might expect.

This isn't to say that picking a major is something unimportant. Especially for people who are very passionate about their topic of study, you can really utilize connections and opportunities presented by your university and professors. 

The concept of some degrees being worth more than others, I find incredibly oversimplified and perpetuated by decades of focus on STEM education over anything else and earning trends of today's workforce.

It could remain true that the STEM field will produce higher earnings, but it may also be true that the continuous influx of students being pushed to only obtain 'useful' degrees may create a more competitive environment in the future as the market continues to be flooded by engineers and computer scientists. 

Pick your major wisely, but also remember that the world is fluid and holds many variables. Take those personal variables into account and decide, if I choose to major in something 'less lucrative' do other variables in my life account for that, am I more passionate, more hardworking, am I willing to take every opportunity I can rather than just barely passing classes and leaving with a degree.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the point about student loans:

Yes student loans can be daunting, and many many students don't go about taking loans in a responsible way. 

There are many different kinds of loans, some you can get straight from your university with or without interest rates. Some have interest rates that only begin after you graduate. Some are private loans (which I don't recommend). 

Essentially, when deciding where to go to college, if you do need to take out loans, do your research. Try and only take loans that are not as predatory, often these come from government aid programs or your university. 

If you do have to take loans that accrue interest, make sure you pay off that interest as soon as it accumulates and pay off those loans as quickly as you can. Simply speaking, if you allow interest to accrue, it will then use that new balance to create interest and you lose money that you could have saved if you just paid of the interest in the first place.

Take as little as you can in loans, treat them with fiscal diligence, and you can avoid the issues that many students face when they are irresponsible with their student loan debt - which I blame mostly on the lack of financial literacy provided to students in any setting.

However, on this note, I do wish that college could be affordable so that no one need worry about student loans at all. They truly hinder many students potential to become great scholars by putting additional financial strain that other students don't necessarily have to face.

Hopefully this could provide a bit more nuance to this whole situation. I always see this argument about some degrees not being worth anything, and if you look at averages of earnings by different majors there is some truth in that, but what is less studied is the variation of earnings within majors that may develop as certain students have more initiative and go on paths after their undergraduate degree. This can be seen slightly with the increase in earning potential for receiving more advanced degrees, but not as specific as I may like to see. 

It's also important to note that bachelor degree holders on average earn more than individuals with only high school diplomas, for all majors. So no matter what you are thinking of doing, please consider going to college!

904ptm,Insulted in class?,"I am currently in my senior years. I was in Biology class and was told to take out my homework which was to find some definitions for a few words.

However, while doing the homework the night prior, I referred to the glossary in the back of the textbook which was what she had told us to do. In her own words, ‚Äúall the definitions are in the back of the book.‚Äù But I could not find ONE definition(of 15) so I left it blank. 

Skip to the next day, I sat in the front row and had to show her my homework first as she came around. However, she picked on me for missing a definition saying that I ‚Äúshould‚Äôve applied my knowledge‚Äù because the answer was in chapter 7(which she had never told us). I told her that she in fact told us to refer to the back of the text but she insulted me saying ‚Äú(my name), you need to stop being so angry and frustrated. I have noticed that about you.‚Äù 

Of course! I do get angry and frustrated but I never mix my emotions with what I do in class and I have never actually felt these feelings in the biology class. And in general, I rarely get angry and frustrated. 

I think what she said was completely uncalled for, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do about it. Other students also couldn‚Äôt find the definition but she didn‚Äôt pick on them, and some didn‚Äôt do any at all! And she just let it go.

7v3h57,HEY SENIORS! I've got some high school/college advice for ya!,"Hello there. I'm currently a senior in high school who was able to start taking college classes early in high school. Here's a link as to what my stats look like, if you're curious: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7uizf4/trying_to_get_into_an_engineering_program_in/

So, chances are if you're reading this, you're probably a high school senior who's already applied (or getting ready to apply) to colleges.

Let me just start off by saying this: **The college you choose to go to does not determine your success later in life!** 

The GPA game is not a fun game to play. The real ""winners"" are the prestigious universities who charge you up the ass in expenses because you're paying for a *brand name*, and not just a degree. Going off to university is an investment in *you*. You will not necessarily have better chances of career success than before by going to Stanford as opposed to Mississippi State. An engineering degree from Georgia Southern is just as good as one from MIT. Nearly any modern entrepreneur or genius can back up that statement; it isn't far-fetched at all.

Now, I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to a top-tier university as opposed to a state or small private university. I just want to make it clear that it's *you*, the individual, that determines your own success, and not the school itself that you end up attending (or would like to attend). You need to find the school that seems like a good fit for you and (*clears throat*) won't get you into a lot of debt, especially if you're getting a non-STEM degree.

""But, but, if I don't get accepted into _X school_, I won't be able to work for _some big and innovative company_!""

If your personal happiness in life is determined by whether or not you'll be able to work for Tesla or Apple or one of the Big Four firms, then you seriously need to reconsider your life goals. Me personally, I don't want to really work for anyone except *myself*. Now, if you're talking about working *with* people and not *for* them, that's a different story. Life isn't solely about getting hired to that big company, getting promoted, and earning a high salary. No one usually gets fulfillment from those things, at least not in the long run.

IMO, I would like to get my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at 20 (given the pace that I'm going at right now) from a decent school, hopefully break even when I graduate, get my PE license at 24, work for about 10 years after that, and hopefully be able to retire very early with just enough in assets like mutual funds and rental properties for me to survive. I don't want to have children because I can never relate to them; I was a mini-adult growing up and found my peers rather annoying. Marriage is out of the question, as well. I just want to live my own way and not have to be consumed by the toxicity of the rat race. I want to tend to my hobbies of drawing, billiards, and studying math.

If you read my previous post that I linked above (because I know you guys love to compare yourselves to others), you'll fall into one of three categories:

--If you have better test scores, GPA, and ECs than me, then you have every right to jerk yourself off to your own success. However, you need to ask yourself: Was it all worth it for you? Was it worth you skipping out on meals, sleep, and your friends and family to study for the SAT that you got a perfectly good score of 1400 on before? Was that AP Exam that cost you $90 to take worth studying for if it meant you had to skip a family funeral to do so? If the answer to this question is no, then you have failed miserably to find a work-life balance. You have essentially valued your own happiness far below your worth to colleges, and you should make the effort *right now* to find something or someone that makes you happy before you kill yourself over it. Oh, and don't forget that there's always someone better than you at something, so there's no sense in thinking you're the GOAT.

--If you rank the same as me in terms of overall achievement, then you've likely been able to be happy, healthy, and in good standing throughout high school. You should be proud of yourself of this because you're achieving something that not a lot of seniors are able to achieve. Please, *please*, don't be concerned about where your more preppy peers are off to college at. What matters is *your* success and not theirs, not to mention that their ""success"" likely came at a steep price.

--If you were a sucky student all throughout high school and didn't have nearly as much achievement as I have, then you're still fine! High school should be an enjoyable experience, but it's not supposed to be ""the most important four years of your life"" as many of your counselors may tell you. You have *many* years of success lined ahead of you; it's about whether or not you will *carpe diem* (Latin for ""seize the day""). I, as a student nor as a human being, am automatically better than you in any way simply because I was able to manage a 3.55 GPA, 16 college classes since junior, and a job as a tutor for trig and calculus. You need to decide what the right path for you to take is in life. Some people will end up dying before ever realizing what they would like to do for the rest of their lives, which is totally fine as long as the journey was a pleasant and thought-provoking one.

TL;DR: Stop worrying over getting into the big schools! You're not going to have more success in life simply because you went to Harvard as opposed to FSU. Life should be about being happy doing the things that you love while achieving the success that goes along with it.

One last thing: Sorry if this thing reads like ass, it's more of a rant than actual advice. I'm not trying to lie here, but if I said something wrong, then please call me out on it.

Now, go enjoy your last semester of high school!

6nrjgo,"I was always inferior to my friends in highschool, socially and academically","When I was in elementary school, I met my best friend. We did everything best friends did, and I never felt more or less than them outside of class. In class, they were always faster and smarter than I was, and at 11 years old, I didn't really think too much about it. We're both highschoolers right now, and I just don't want to be around them because of their unknowingly being and feeling superior to me. Their grades were always better than mine, and they were generally more driven to become great academically and socially- which was what drove me to my lowest. I was happy for them, and I always supported them. But then I looked at myself and realized, ""What am I doing for myself?"" I quickly became extremely insecure about my social skills and leadership skills that I wasn't able to do anything. The more I was around this person, the more and more angry and insecure I would get. They were making new friends and making great experiences for themselves. I felt so outcasted. I tried to distance myself from them and I made my own friends, but none of them had the special type of bond I had with my best friend. This best friend has skipped plenty of math classes, is taking APs, and is a leader in a school club, which I introduced them to, thinking that I was going to be the active one- but they beat me to it. I'm jealous of what they have and what they've achieved, all the experiences they've gotten, and I know I shouldn't be, because they have worked for what they got and I didn't. But I don't know how to improve myself and I don't have much time to make experiences and leadership skills until college. Who knows if I'll even go to college- they've already set the bar so high for others.

e7baq3,Short stories from my high school.,"I was always the crackhead in the class. Waiting till the very last second to write a 5 page essay was my jam. Enjoy some #shortstories from weird ass childhood.

P1 Argumentative Essay about Pizza vs Tacos.

  

1) Pizza is better than tacos because it is cleaner. 2) Pizza is better than tacos because it is more readily available. 3) Pizza is better than tacos because it can feed more for less money.

Have you ever been eating a taco and everything falls out the back of it? This is a problem that plagues many Americans enjoying this Mexican classic. Luckily Italians have their heads screwed on straight and found a much cleaner, more efficient method of consuming a weeks‚Äô worth of calories and sodium in one sitting.  Originating in 1889, pizza has been a widely known and enjoyed meal for over a century. Tacos, however, have been around since the 18th century and their name originated from little charges silver miners would use to excavate ore. Sit back and relax as I explain why the pizza is the ultimate meal.

Pizza is a circular round of dough with a variety of toppings, usually sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. Some people like to put pineapple on this delectable meal, however, that is completely nasty, and what some would call unholy. Tacos start with a base of tortilla rounds, which can be either hard or soft, then put meat, cabbage, and a variety of vegetables including cilantro. Now that we know what these snacks are, we can move on to our first topic of why pizza is so much better than tacos. Pizza is finished when it is put in the oven to bake, therefore when it comes out, all the toppings have been baked on and are securely fastened. With tacos, however, the ingredients are usually all laid out beforehand and the consumer puts on which toppings he would like. This is insecure and without due practice and preparation, usually ends up with the toppings spread everywhere but the taco. Also, with a hard shell, cracking is prone and all the juices from the meat and sauces fall onto your hand and pants. 

Have you ever found yourself up at 3am, hungry, and had nothing to eat? Most people in this predicament call their nearest pizzeria, order their favorite pizza, and it is delivered within 30 minutes. You can also go down to your local Walmart and grab a frozen, premade pizza. These pizzas usually take 17 minutes to bake at 425 and is ready to eat before you can start your next Netflix episode. You can also get a taco from Walmart, but these usually come out soggy and require more preparation. Even if you want to make your own taco, you must prepare the ingredients before and place each taco carefully to not break it. To my knowledge, there is no taco stand that would be open at 3am and willing to suffice your ravenous order of 10-15 tacos. When you bake a pizza, half of that pizza usually will fill you up and you have lunch or breakfast for the next day. It can take up to 15 normal size tacos to suffice my rather large appetite at 3am. 

When out buying ingredients for tacos, you will have to buy more of a variety of ingredient, which in turn costs you more to have your meal. You also must wash and prep the vegetables and bake the meat for the tacos. If you go down to your local Walmart, you can easily and efficiently get all the ingredients required to make one single pizza, or as previously discussed, you can buy a premade, frozen pizza and warm it up in the oven. A premade pizza costs around $13 and feeds about 3-5 people, depending on if you have teenagers participating in the meal. Tacos require you to buy the shells, fresh vegetables, meat, and sauces, which will cost you about $20 and feeds around 5 people. You also can store pizza for up to two weeks in the freezer, but because of the fresh vegetables and shells in the tacos, any leftover ingredients will last you about a week, if you are willing to take the chances of old vegetables. 

I hope this essay has convinced you that pizza is clearly the better midnight snack, meal to have with your in-laws, and casual dinner with your significant other. Tacos require so much time and dedication that the average American would choose pizza over them. You must also learn how to cook to prepare tacos. Pizza is just a couple buttons away.",highschool,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/e7baq3/short_stories_from_my_high_school/,False,,2,Reeeeeeee ,2019-12-07 15:09:14

Also, what I do to keep me positive is hanging out with my authentic friends every once and a while. I have a really close family friend who goes to a different school and we hang out like once every month and FaceTime often so just remind yourself that you're not totally alone, its just at school. Also what really keeps me positive is college. I know I will end up in a college that I was meant to be at, and then, everything will be a fresh slate and I can make meaningful relationships with people that will actually matter. In just 3 years, you won't even think about highschool so stay hopeful!!!

8gevnv,Looking for an online high school during the summer to get ahead for math please help,I‚Äôm an 8th grader going into high school this coming fall. And I really really want to place into geometry frosh year. But I didn‚Äôt do well enough on my practice test so I got placed into the class below (algebra 1). I figure if I can take algebra 1 over the summer I might be able to take geometry freshman year. And if worst comes to worst I will just be really ahead and glide through math frosh year. So does anyone know a really good online summer school that offers algebra one high school course? I am also a busy person so it would be preferred if I could find one that takes less time and spans over a longer period. And if not. What other options do I have to get ahead and ready for high school math please please help me,highschool,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/8gevnv/looking_for_an_online_high_school_during_the/,False,,4,"check out bridge programs for geometry. They cost money, but it at least pretty much guarantees placement in geometry next year. Other than that, Khan Academy is good and you might be able to just go and ask one of the current Algebra I teachers at your school for a list of topics that are covered (you may also be able to find this online).
