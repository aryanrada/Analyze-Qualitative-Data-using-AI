I initially had my ad open for everyone because I didn't want to narrow the window too much. As long as you're a professional around my age and aren't a sleazeball, I didn't mind.

It only took about two days for the messages from thirsty men asking if I would be open to living with them rent free in exchange for sex. Which was always phrased as ""help around the house/cleaning"" or ""companionship"". I ignored most, but one guy called me directly.

Now someone did ask me if ""a blowjob a week was really that bad in exchange for free rent"". From a pragmatic standpoint, no. From a ""personal morals, safety, and mental health"" standpoint, YES.

Don't EVER feel like under the table prostitution is your only option. Do NOT let someone coerce you into doing it no matter how much you need the money. If sex work is something you want to do, that's perfectly fine. Just...don't start through these guys.

And even if it started out as a BJ a week, these guys will never stop asking for more. And no one needs their life controlled by the sexual whims of some dickhead who thinks he's entitled to your body in exchange for a roof over your head.

44,cwlknn,False,None,470,A tip for the lurkers and commenters here: Go to /personalfinance if you want to be a judgmental prick about money and people‚Äôs problems instead of in a POVERTY sub.,povertyfinance,"Like what is wrong with some of these people?? The vast majority of people who use this sub is specifically because they are POOR/STRUGGLING. We post here for advice, tips, and support. We don‚Äôt post here so we can get X amount of comments from judgmental assholes who say over and over, ‚ÄúJust get a job‚Äù ‚Äúsounds like you‚Äôre the problem‚Äù ‚Äúget over it‚Äù ‚Äúthis is your fault‚Äù ‚Äúwork harder‚Äù ‚ÄúHow is this possible for you to be poor??‚Äù ‚ÄùJust move, I don‚Äôt see the issue.‚Äù


Let me tell you something, because I think I speak for most of us. I work beyond full time. I work side jobs in my free time, including on my lunch breaks everyday. My circumstances are *none* of your business, but my circumstances are still valid. Everyone‚Äôs are, especially if they‚Äôre making an effort to escape them. I was born into a very lower class family, my parents were from poor families. Most of us born into this are already off on the wrong foot. Poverty is a vicious cycle most of us are all fighting like hell to break and get out of. It takes time. It takes effort, which again, the vast majority of us are giving that full effort. We are **trying**, we really are, but living in/coming out of poverty is fucking *hard.* Not to mention that our society does not make escaping poverty easy. It costs money to move. It costs money to learn a trade, go to school, go to the doctor, get mental health help. While of course, it‚Äôs not impossible (we know this), so many people act like escaping poverty is a quick fix. This is untrue.

To add to that, there are different tiers to poverty. Some people are born into it, others fall on incredibly hard times, some people get fucked over by their families or loved ones (eg: taking loans out in our names, ruining credit, stealing our money, etc etc), some people are disabled, some people just make mistakes, learn from them, and are trying to pick up the pieces. And the sad fact is ~~some~~ many people, despite working hard which so many of you claim we don‚Äôt do, are only one or two paychecks away from poverty, just barely staying afloat, and doing all they can. It. Happens. Maybe not to you - and congratulations to you all - but it happens to people every single day. We are living it. It‚Äôs literally all around you.

We are still human. I‚Äôll repeat that: **we are still human.**

Some days, we just really need to vent. That‚Äôs all. It doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt trying. But working hard, trying to be strong, dealing with the stress, it all gets to you. That‚Äôs part of the whole ‚Äúbeing human‚Äù thing. It‚Äôs a heavy weight to carry. That‚Äôs what, in my opinion, this sub is for. Being able to relate and hear others out, and offer advice, it‚Äôs what helps people continue to push through when they feel like giving up, and makes the weight a liiiiiittle less heavy. 

You don‚Äôt get to call someone lazy, make general shitty judgments and overall rude assuming comments about how they got where they are nor why they‚Äôre where they are now, when the *only* thing you know about their lives is exactly what is posted here. 

So if you‚Äôre the type of person to judge and criticize those on this sub who seek out advice or just want to vent, maybe step away from the screens and take a good hard look at yourself. Reflect on your poor character and be better. Having some perspective will make life a little less miserable for you, and maybe you‚Äôll gain a little empathy. We may be struggling, but at least we treat others with respect. Because for a lot of us, who we are and our determination to live better lives despite any circumstances and the holier-than-thou ignorant bullshit around us is almost all we have. The last thing we need is to be kicked while we‚Äôre down. 

We won‚Äôt stand for it. I know I won‚Äôt. Not anymore.

Edit: and to those who have dealt with this and/or are just struggling right now, I hear you. I see you. You are more than your circumstance, and you‚Äôll get through this. Keep fighting the good fight and vent when you need to. Better days are coming!

And of course you will always have people who victimize, or just won‚Äôt help themselves or don‚Äôt take accountability (it still doesn‚Äôt justify insulting and degrading them, but I know there are people who need to recognize certain issues when they‚Äôre in their own way). But just speaking generally, being in a bad financial position doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt trying. Everyone is different, what works for some doesn‚Äôt work for others. Just...be freaking nice to people? Offer constructive advice? Or just don‚Äôt say anything at all if it‚Äôs nothing good or necessary.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/cwlknn/a_tip_for_the_lurkers_and_commenters_here_go_to/,11320,[deleted] ,2019-08-28 14:28:46
45,da0dqr,False,None,636,People don't consider the psychological consequences of being poor,povertyfinance,"We all agree that the idea of budgeting yourself out of poverty is utter bullshit, but one thing I never see anyone talking about is how hard it is to have self-control when you're poor

You chronically don't have enough money to do what you want to do. 

Your car breaks down? You're fucked.

A relative or yourself get sick? You're fucked.

And there's bills, food, gas, rent.

If you're poor, most likely you work a lot and earn very little. You are deprived of energy, nutrition, and happiness.

Then you get like, 300 extra bucks. You've wanted to get pizza for three months. You've walked past that expensive book you've wanted to buy for months. There's that bicycle you've wanted for years. That nice phone (yours sicks, of course). That pretty dress. Those nice shoes.

For MONTHS you've wanted that. MONTHS. Willpower is a limited resource. You've been forced to economize every dollar for necessities for a lengthy period of time.

Chances are that you're going to spend those 300 hundred dollars in something you don't need because you are TIRED. Deprived. Unhappy. You have these 300 hundred dollars now. You don't know when the next 300 hundred will come. You could indeed put them aside... but that byke? When will you have the money again? 

You've worked 12 hours and you're coming home. Your fridge is empty. You should go to the grocery store, pick food, get home, get the bags home, cook the food, eat the food 2 hours later. You are too tired for that. You still have to clean your house up and have a shower. It's three weeks that you want pizza. You say ""fuck it"" and buy pizza even if you can't really afford it. 

Rich people spend their money better because they know they are going to have more money. There's no rush because if they can't buy the bicycle this month, you will be able to another time. They could afford pizza last week, so it's easier to say no to pizza this week. They worked 8 hours, there's time to clean up. Other money is going to come.

We are just human beings. We are constantly bombarded with ads and things and new needs created by new markets (smartphones didn't even exist in 2007. Now you literally can't function in society without one and an internet connection. You literally can't find a job if you don't have at least a smartphone). Poor people do tend to do poor choices when it comes to money, but it's just physiological (I, at least, do many). You can only go so far with depriving yourself of pleasurable things.

Sooner or later you are going to break and spend your money on something dumb because you are exhausted.

It's not just a matter of not materially having money. No one considers energy, time and willpower, resources that you quickly finish when everything you have to do it grind your teeth and keep going.

EDIT: Wow I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to blow up- THANK YOU for all the upvotes, the awards and the excellent advice I‚Äôve received!! 

To answer some of your questions, I took this position back in March, as an assistant in an administrative/ accounting type capacity. I‚Äôd had about five years of related experience. My immediate supervisor abruptly resigned in June, and I stepped in to fill the role. In the process I discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in discrepancies (which I have managed to mostly correct.). My initial salary offer (the 2k raise) was made before these problems came to light and it was supposed to take place at the beginning of the year. 

I am not rich by any means not even after the increase- I went from making low five figures to mid range five figures, but the increase is probably all the more significant because it boosts me and my kids from ‚Äúlow income‚Äù into ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù territory. It‚Äôs thrilling for me to see some light at the end of the paycheck-to-paycheck tunnel after years of being dead broke and unable to even afford normal basics. 

Yes I am paying this forward already (see my comment history for details).

Been working for the last decade in the public school system, with my actual position being paid through a non profit. As I was working for a non profit, my pay was always low for the work I was doing, but that was the norm as schools in this area pay non profits to serve children as a way to save money.

About a year ago my companies management team took a hit when my bosses boss left. The guy who replaced her is, for lack of a better term, an idiot. The team has been struggling mightily and it has resulted in people in my position being jerked around and treated badly. About a month ago, it was my turn. New guy in management tried to fix something that didn‚Äôt need fixing by transferring me to another school. My current schools principle pulled me into the office and said she was unhappy with how my team had handled the situation, but that she felt badly, as she felt like I was made to be the scapegoat. She said her main priority in this situation was to keep me in the building, and proceeded to offer me a job.

Here‚Äôs where the life changing part comes in. Met with HR earlier to get a formal job offer and my grown ass cried like a baby in front of them. First, my pay is going up from just under $30k to just over $40k. That is a huge pay increase that was more than enough for me, but not the end of the good news. 

Four years ago, we had our first child, and My insurance went through the roof. For the last four years, I have been paying nearly $12k a year for health insurance for my son and I (about $225 a week). Well come to find out, being employed by the school system means that insurance for the two of us is covered at 100%. As in its free.

Basically my pay almost doubled.

I don‚Äôt say this to diminish this event, but I want you to realize that even at $40k+ there‚Äôs still room for growth.

---

The US Congress passed H.R.6800, also known as the HEROES Act, on May 15, 2020, but it is currently being stalled by the Senate. This bill is very similar to the CARES Act, but it expands the pool of eligible recipients of a second round of stimulus payments (including full-time students under the age of 24 as dependents) and requires that private student loan lenders offer the same forgiveness and repayment terms as federal student loans. The bill also includes $200 billion budgeted for hazard pay for essential workers.

Millions of Americans are still unemployed and may not be able to find work for awhile, especially given that COVID-19 cases are increasing in many areas of the country. The expanded unemployment benefits of $600/week are set to expire on July 31, 2020. This expanded benefit has been a lifeline for many people and losing it would be financially devastating.

Please contact your US Senator and urge that to take action as soon as possible. Our government representatives need to prioritize helping Americans get through this pandemic and the resulting recession.

148,fe2dg9,False,None,633,"Please avoid dental ""corporations"". They specifically prey on people with low-income / no insurance / haven't seen a dentist in awhile. They are trained in high pressure sales like a car dealership and put profits over health.",povertyfinance,"[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/patients-pressure-and-profits-at-aspen-dental/](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/patients-pressure-and-profits-at-aspen-dental/)

This article sums it up pretty well but I'd also like to share my personal experience. A little background information: I'm 21 and due to not having dental insurance haven't seen a dentist since I was 19. My teeth are in pretty good shape and I have no major pain / visible issues. I only wanted to see a dentist due to the amount of time it's been and paranoia that I may need dental work due to this. I went to Aspen Dental because they offered a free exam and advertised $80 cleanings.

They got me checked in and after a short wait took some X-Rays of my teeth. I waited for a bit more and they got me in the chair where a dental hygienist reviewed my X-Rays and looked in my mouth briefly. When I say briefly I mean she examined my mouth and X-Rays for less than 2 minutes. I'm not a professional but it seems like you would want to do a more thorough examination. She claimed that I ""almost had"" periodontal disease and showed me on the X-Ray where I had allegedly developed deposits that lead to this. I asked her to show me my other teeth and to my untrained eye there was no visible difference and she wasn't able to show me any difference between my ""healthy"" teeth and my ""diseased"" teeth. Though I believed her as I am again, not an expert but I was skeptical as I have brushed my teeth twice a day for as long as I can remember and regularly use mouthwash and floss. I don't smoke or do anything that puts me at risk for disease, but again, I am no expert, so I took this all as truth.  She prescribed scaling and a follow up cleaning for this.

I waited a bit more and the dentist came in and did another very quick examination. The first thing he said is that I should get braces because I have an overbite. I told the dentist that I have had braces and wore my retainer exactly as prescribed and that I used to have a severe overbite and the braces corrected it. He immediately changed his tune and said that I should get braces because my wisdom teeth are going to cause crowding. (This didn't make sense but again, he's the dentist). He also said I need to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed, and get 1 filling.

They then took me to the finance office, where they handed me a ""treatment plan"" for $2,545. I about passed out. I looked at some of the items on the bill. $135 for a toothbrush, $45 for a ""Listerine rinse"" (mouthwash), $87 for a problem related exam prior to the extractions, $450 for each tooth extraction, $16 x4 for each quadrant of the mouth for ""oral irrigation"" (pressurized water). And other absurd charges. I told them upfront that I couldn't afford this, and she offered me financing options, with 48 MONTH and 60 MONTH loan terms. With a 15.99% APR!!!! They wanted me to take the same loan term with a higher interest rate than I do on my *brand new car* . Or a 12 months deferred interest option with *28.99%* APR.

The woman was trying really hard to pressure me into agreeing to one of these finance options for procedures I wasn't even sure I needed. She said all she needed was a signature. She kept claiming it was just permission to schedule the appointment even though the terms on the document were clearly for a credit check. They wanted me to be paying $72/mo for 5 years to get all of this done. My wisdom teeth aren't causing me any pain, grew in straight and in their entirety, and aren't even touching any of my other teeth. A quick google search of the symptoms of periodontal disease showed that I don't have any of the signs, and I certainly don't need a $135 toothbrush. I want to emphasize there's a chance that they are right as I'm no expert, but this is still absurd, even more so if they are trumping up the procedures I need (there is evidence to prove this company does this). She just wanted me to sign the form and they kept trying to disguise it as something besides a credit check.

I worked at a car dealership for two weeks and quit because of how disgusting it felt to take advantage of people and I can assure you they were using the same tactics that car salesmen use.

The sad part is that I didn't get the worst of it, if you read the article I posted above, Aspen Dental has a history of recommending extractions and other procedures when they aren't needed. I'm not saying this is my case because I recognize that I am not a dental expert in any capacity and I don't have the ability to diagnose these things, and I recognize that I may very well need all of this, but these ridiculous charges and insane financing options are predatory and disgusting.

Please avoid companies like this if you can, it's really hard to get dental care in the US without insurance and I'm still assessing my options. These corporations are the source of most dental complaints and the regulations for them are VERY LOOSE, they are not held to the same standards as your family dentists and reports say that many dentists for Aspen and other corporations are unqualified and perform poorly. They bait you with the free exams and try to convince you to pay for absurd amounts of work. These aren't people you want working on your teeth. They are pressured by the corporation to generate profits by any means necessary and will put this over your health.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/fe2dg9/please_avoid_dental_corporations_they/,5281,"21 and last saw a dentist at 19?!?!?

&#x200B;

Why don't you stop buying Starbucks/Netflix/beer/movie tickets/whatever occasional purchase you use to feel a little better? Won't that fix your financial situation? Why is the snack/trinket/experience worth more?

Let me lead with this: Money has no intrinsic value. You avoid spending money on one thing so that you can spend it on another. That's the reason. You can choose to not spend as much on one thing so that you can pay for something else. If the savings on one thing are not enough to purchase the other thing, it makes no sense to not get the enjoyable thing that you can afford.

The example:

Let's say you want to buy a car. You can get a nice, new car for $25k. We're ignoring trade in value or savings for a down payment in these calculations because poor people don't tend to have significant equity \[update: not because you are poor in this scenario but because we're going to work from zero with our numbers\]. We're starting from the bottom. The average interest rate for a new car loan in the US is 4.21%. This would make your payments $463/month.

Now, let's say that you don't want to get that car loan. You want to avoid that pesky interest rate. It just doesn't make financial sense, right? Instead you opt to ride public transit until you can save up enough for the car. The average cost of a transit pass in the US is $67/month. That's $396 less than the car payment, so that's $396/month out of your transportation budget that you can tuck away.

It will take you **over five years to afford that car**.

That is five years of only going where the buses run while the buses are running. That is five years of dealing with other people's smells and sounds. That is five years of walking to and from transit stops.

This is a best case scenario. What if you don't live in a city with adequate transit? What if it's more expensive in your city? What if you work overnight, and the buses don't go in the direction you need at the times you need them to? What if a drunk person pukes or pees on you? Because that happens.

Given the choice, many of us would just pay the extra to commute in clean privacy for those five years. It's worth it to be able to go where you want when you want. The benefits would outweigh the costs, as evidenced by the number of Americans with auto loans.

**The only other way to compress that timeline is to be able to increase your transportation budget.**

This is why broke people buy lattes instead of investing. It's because if you bought a frappuccino every day, it would take **nine and a half years** to spend the equivalent of a 7% down payment on a $250k house. It would take **almost four years** even for a $100k house.

**You cannot nickel and dime your way out of poverty.**

If you wouldn't sit in someone else's urine stains for five years, leave the poor person buying an avocado alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit:  Yikes. Where do I begin?

I thought that the first paragraph explained my purpose clearly enough, but this is a scenario meant to explain a certain type of opportunity cost to someone living above a certain standard. Imaginary scenario guy is obviously not that hard up. I'm thinking it was a certain line that confused people, and I've edited it accordingly.

The daily frappuccino example is a theoretical maximum pulled from a common trope of ""financial advice"" columns. No broke person is buying one every day, but even if they were, that's the absolute most they could save. No, that number isn't nothing, but that's an imaginary peak. The point is that it's not the coffee that's keeping people out of escrow.

But look what people did.

They fought tooth and nail to explain why an imaginary person with the space in their budget should not buy something they want. I've been accused of making up interest rates, never having ridden a bus, never having seen a homeless person \[projection much?\], etc. All my numbers were pulled from national averages compiled in the last year. Some of the numbers were surprising enough to be in headlines. The pee scenario? Pulled from a true story. The struggles of public transit? From my own experience in my city. I've been to cities with beautiful transit that could easily replace a car, but for myself and many other Americans that's just not a realistic situation.

I was just trying to give people a tool to make a point. That point is that it's not anyone's business to police how somebody else makes their way through a long term problem. (And for a lot of people poverty isn't long term but actually permanent. It's just a fact that many people die in poverty. I'm not being pessimistic. It's a statistic.)

If I might get something in ten years, it's up to me to decide whether that's worth chipping away at the quality of the days in between. It's not anyone else's job to pass judgement on that decision.

My spring semester officially ended on Monday. I got an email in my student account saying to check my student information center because I had been sent an important message by the college. Not gonna lie, I got scared that it had something to do with my financial aid. (On track to receive the full Pell grant for the 2020-2021 school year).

I checked my student inbox and saw this:

**Due to the disruption of campus operations as a result of COVID-19 you've been selected to receive a grant in the range of $1000-$1100.  This grant should be used for things such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care.

We expect to be processing these funds within 2 weeks.**

I am straight up ugly crying. I filed for unemployment back in March and have yet to receive a single unemployment or PUA check. I'm so behind on bills. Food banks and the kindness of other Redditors are my saving grace right now. When I finally got my stimulus check, it went to back paying my landlord and utilities but now they are racked back up again. With this grant from my school, I'll be able to pay my share of May's rent and the utilities and might even have a little left over to put on my credit card.

I'm super happy that some people are planning and executing their plans to pay back their debt well. However I feel this subs focus should be more on tips and advice rather than a collection of payment receipt pictures. The former has substance while the latter does not.

167,9o5zcn,False,None,454,"Do not underestimate the effect of working a few extra hours a week. Every dollar of high interest debt you pay now will save roughly two dollars in the long run. 10-12 hours extra a week can pay off $10000 in one year by eliminating $5000 in future interest, or take nearly a year off your mortgage",povertyfinance,"Ever wonder if taking a second job or extra shifts is really worth it? Wonder if your spouse working a light job will really help? 

If you have high interest debt like credit cards, the answer is absolutely yes! 

At the average credit card rate of 15% or higher, every dollar you pay now saves 2 dollars by the time you pay it off. So that extra $7.75 or $10 per hour becomes $15.50 or $20 per hour when you take into effect how much it saves you when you put it towards paying off that high interest debt. 

Even if you don't have high interest debt and you have a decent mortgage, over the life of a 20 or 30 year mortgage you pay nearly $2 for every dollar you took out. 

So paying an extra $5000 a year up front from a 10 hour a week second job will end up saving you nearly $10,000, or almost a year of payments for every year you work the second job.

If you work an extra 10 hours a week for 10 years and put that towards the average mortgage, it will save you 10 years of payments for the equivalent of only 2.5 years of full time work. 

So yes, if you work a little extra and put that towards your debt, you can dramatically improve your debt situation and free up years of your life in the future.

I have no one to tell about this huge victory because I kept my debt a complete secret. I hope that someone who is in debt reads this and knows that you're not alone and you CAN get out of debt. Maybe not entirely. But the journey must start somewhere. I am super lucky I live in Canada where I don't have medical debt and I have a sibling who I could move in with. While I was in debt, my income was about $60k per year. I know this sounds like a ton of money but I live an extremely high cost of living area and when I started to get sick, my income dropped significantly (I am hourly).

In May of 2018, I was diagnosed with a gynecological cancer (I am early 30's and it is not a common cancer for young women...which is why I wasn't diagnosed for some months) and had surgery to remove a large tumour. My tumour was Stage 1 and had not spread. I recovered and went back to work in August of 2018. That was ROCK BOTTOM.  When I went back to work, my debt had hit $24,900 and yes, it was entirely on two credit cards with 19.99% APR. No bank would give me a consolidation loan. My parents and siblings did not have money to spare. My parents had just divorced and my siblings were making large life changes such as buying property (1 sib), having children (2nd sib), and going back to school (3rd sib)...I did not want to ask. I kept it a secret.

My entire debt was racked up between March of 2017 and May of 2018. The triggering event was...my bf of 8 years dumped me out of the blue and left our shared apartment in March of 2017 (while I was at work...). I live in Vancouver, Canada, where a 1 bedroom is about $2000/month. Following being dumped, I had to find a new place to live in a city with a vacancy rate hovering around 1%. Rents were skyrocketing.

When I was dumped, I had no debt. I also had NO savings, as I just thrown my entire savings account at my student loan to pay it off (HORRIBLE TIMING).  So...always have an emergency fund. Do not start paying off debt until you have $1000-$2000 saved up...or else you'll just go into debt again.

I went into debt to pay for an apartment deposit (rent, damage deposit, tenants insurance, moving van ect). Then my car (an old Honda that is still going today) needed extensive repairs (brakes). My hearing aids died in September (Yes, I am partly deaf, and no, these are NOT covered by Canadian health care...my hearing aids were $6000). And I started to get sick and work less. I had no idea I had cancer. I was not diagnosed properly until my third doctor's visit. Around this time, my work was wondering why I was coming in super late and wasn't producing good work. I am a professional (regulated profession, won't say which) and this was scary. I thought I was going to lose my job.

So I racked up ALOT of debt. When I got sick and finally got a goddamn medical certificate signed by a doctor, I had to wait for my Employment Insurance to kick in, and paid my bills using credit cards. I had no short term medical insurance from my workplace. The benefits are shit...anyways.

Here is what I did to get OUT of debt.

\- I moved out of my expensive apartment, sold half of my belongings on Craigslist, and moved in with a sibling over 1 hour from my work (one way) into a really crappy apartment

\- I sold things like my skis on my craigslist. This HURT. But it was cash. Threw that at debt.

\- I started to work at home more to cut down on my commute (I realize this isn't feasible for a lot of people but basically, gas will KILL you, as will wear and tear on your car. If you can't work at home, move closer to work, move into a house with 8 PEOPLE, whatever it takes. Debt is an EMERGENCY).

\- I threw every DOLLAR at my debt. Every payday, I kept an $x amount of money for my cellphone bill, rent, gas, and food, and threw the remaining $ at my debt. If the money wasn't in my account I could not spend it.

\- Stopped buying ANYTHING. I cut my own hair. I made my lunch. I ate shit like crackers and canned soups. I stopped buying clothes. I sewed holes in my clothes. You name it. NOTHING.

\- I did a balance transfer to get some debt onto a 0% card (10 months of no interest, pay $10 per month to maintain the balance)

\- Took care of my mental health by going for walks, riding my bike, reading at the library, grabbing an ice cream, calling my friends, visiting my parents, writing in my journal, going for hikes ect.

\- I got serious fatigue paying off my debt. I felt like I was throwing money at a fire and it never went out. This will happen. It is called debt fatigue. When this happened, I would go for a walk, cry in my car, write down how much I had paid off, write down what I would do when the debt was gone...it helped. You have to push through this. It is incredibly difficult but once the balances start dropping, it gets easier and easier. You start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

\- I've read this before. You sometimes cannot budget yourself out of debt. Sometimes, it is just too big. I just want people to know, you can be in the darkest hole of your life (for me, that was being dumped by my partner of 8 years at age 32, getting cancer that threatened my ability to ever have kids, and winding up in deep debt) and you MUST stick to the plan, write down your goals, and DO something about it. The bad times won't last. Tough people do.

Fuck...I can't believe it is gone. Thank fuck.

Always have an emergency fund. ALWAYS. If transportation or rent are killing you, be creative to the best of your ability, I know it is HARD out there, I am a renter in an insane market and I live in a CLOSET. My car is a piece of shit. My clothes have holes in them. But my debt is GONE. Do whatever you can!

Bless you all.

He had a fine of about 3000 dollars that we couldn't pay, the employer refused to pay and he died almost a year ago. When I finally confronted my boss for the money (about 5 months salary) he fired me on the spot.

I'm going back home tomorrow and I have 53 dollars (actually less coz I bought something to drink) and no where to go. My Dad is also trapped here.

I just thought I'd mention it, whatever you do, don't come to the Middle East if you are a poor person. 


Edit: This is a story I typed a while back, before I was hit with the visa fine (employers fault) and before I was eventually refused all the money owed to me. Like I said, 53 dollars for 5 months of work

EDIT2: I'm 13 hours away from going home, we're desperately trying to arrange money so I have a place to go to. 

It's been really good to finally have people agreeing with me and having discussions about the problems here and not just saying it's my own fault. If you go look I've posted about this many many times and it didn't interest a lot of people; I just want people to know what happens here so they can avoid it.

 (I'm not asking for money, I'm just saying) I need 170 something dollars for a room for one month, my Dad is trying o ask his employer for some of his unpaid wages but it doesn't look great at the moment. My Dad and i have both been homeless before, I don't want to be like that again but I choose that over being stuck here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9iuhdz/if_you_ever_get_an_opportunity_to_work_in_the/,4687,"The moral of your story: Never leave your comfort zone.

Last night I was working at the pizza joint, get a call, lady orders a pizza and wings, nothing fancy, I think around $24 total, she says she'll pay cash. It's in the oven cooking and I'm working on something else and the phone rings.

the caller ID shows me it's the same lady who's order is in the oven.

* lady - yes this is \[delivery address\] I just placed an order, but I don't have the cash to pay for it.

Edit: it can also be configured to find the cheapest grocery store to go to instead of choosing multiple ones.

I am extending it to search flyers for products (e.g. for stores which do not have an online search) to add those to the price comparisons. Additionally, it could be set up for price alerts (e.g. orange juice went on sale), which product is cheapest per gram/mL, and what products have similar nutrition value to a chosen product. It could also be used to find which recipe is cheapest on a certain day as the prices refresh everyday.

But i always pushed through and i'm not done yet. I really want to expand on my current skill set and improve even more. So cheers to everyone, thanks for all the praise. And i hope we all make it someday.**

&#x200B;

I doubt anyone will read this as its super duper fucking long. But i don't have many close friends that i can share my excitement with. So here we go.

I was a very difficult kid as a teenager, my parents split when i was 12 and my older brother and sister had just left for college being only 1 year in age difference. So I was alone to be shuffled back and forth between them. My dad found a rebound pretty quick like 2 months after and spent 90% of his energy on her. My mom developed a bad drinking habit getting wasted every night. My dad was never open to talk about anything so that's kind of how we were raised. I never told my brother or sister what went on hell we weren't close only seeing each other on holidays or a call on a birthday.

I saw what they had through their teenage years and what I got instead and I despised it. I started getting in trouble in school, got expelled quickly in 6th grade 3 weeks before the end of the year (after amassing over 60 write ups, so many suspensions etc) and they passed me anyways.

Switched school districts a bunch over the years back and forth between my mom and dad house who lived 45 mins apart. Getting expelled 7 times, and even expelled from alternative schools. Last time I got expelled from the 9th grade for the 2nd time my family made the choice to send me to a military school GED program at the age of 15. I almost got kicked out of that for getting into 2 fights and had a lot of disciplinary platoon where we had to workout for 2 hours in the morning if we got in trouble. But the leader of the program kept me in for some reason and I got my GED 3 months later right after turning 16.

I ended up still being bad with nothing to do now. Mom moved to another state. And my Dad kicked me out after finding weed at the house (oh btw he had 2 more kids with my stepmom who were 3-1 at this time). So at age 16 I couch surfed with friends. Got arrested 3-4 times for weed, under age drinking, evading police (running from party) ended up having warrants put out on me when I missed court. 6 charges 30 days each run consecutive since I skipped court.  At this time I'm 18 now. I get pulled over while riding with a friend for a headlight being out and they ID everyone in the car and arrest me.

I get sent to jail which I had been before on all my previous charges. Next morning they transfer me to the state prison evaluation center because anybody in my county with a sentence of over 90 days goes to prison to serve time instead of jail. I got to the evaluation center and it's where everyone gets classified to see what level yard they are going to, what gang they're in etc. Everyone in the state who goes to prison stops through this center for 90 days. Anyways I stay in here with 2 cell mates on 23 hour a day lock down (cant let us out cause we're all unclassified), only out to eat then get locked right back up.

It sucked the only person who wrote me was my friends mom who I had been living with who cared about me like a son. She even hired a lawyer to help get me out god bless her. My mom called too actually she was always very nice over the years but lived far away and had her own problems. I dont blame my dad for not contacting me, he gave me plenty of chances over the years and I always did the wrong thing I was and am still very stubborn. So I got out after 2 months time served thanks to the lawyer.¬†

Now over the years up to this point i have had several entry level jobs. Fast food, waitor etc. And i was always a very hard worker every boss i ever had loved me. I had grown out of most of my bad habits but had no way to support myself and was still living with a friend.

&#x200B;

Anyways my moms boyfriend had a job opportunity for me to come work with him in another state as a flagger and he was a lineman. Well i did that and quickly took over doing most of the work while he would drive the truck and flag and show me what i need to do. Which i didn't mind hes older so i didn't think it fair for him to do the hard labor anyways. So i did this for like 5 months staying in hotels there he payed for until we completed all the work on his current contract.

&#x200B;

So now here i was out of work again. He had been paying me $400 a week under the table which to me was a fortune. And i had no bills to pay so i was banking it all. I had a taste of actually doing something meaning full and i didn't want to let it go. Up until this point i had always been the family fuck up. My brother and sister had their own problems growing up but nothing close to what i did. I felt like an embarrassment to my family and a piece of crap knowing it was all my own doing. My brother and sister were very smart, brother became an engineer with a great company and my sister (who i have never been close with, we only have ever texted happy birthday once a year) was in medical school. I never put blame on anyone but myself only years later realizing the circumstances that had stoked the fire of my troubled youth. Even if i was put in a tough situation as an adolescent it was my fault for how i handled it.

&#x200B;

So here i am no job, on a greyhound going back home knowing i have no where to live and that the place is a bad environment for me because of people, drugs, etc.

&#x200B;

Then i get a call from my moms boyfriend 2 weeks later and he says his friend has work down in Alabama. So i take a grey hound bus down to Alabama and start working on a wireless DAS install there. My first time ever doing this work and i started at $12 an hour 70 hours a week. They had an apartment rented for us employees and i was making a killing at my age thought i had it made. The overtime made my checks actually pretty nice and i banked all of my paychecks only spending per diem we got on my necessities.

&#x200B;

So i loved it and started working my ass off. I sought every day to be the hardest worker there i didn't want there to be a single person out performing me. And the guy who got me the job originally was the foreman of our side of the install. And he recognized my hard work and loved me, he put me in charge of running a crew 2 months in. I was leading 4-5 people running coax cable, installing connectors, placing antennas etc.

&#x200B;

The job ended and the company decided to bring me on full time up in the DMV area. They bumped my pay rate to $15 an hour and had a hotel for me to stay at which they paid. We finished a 6 month project at a nearby stadium and since they're a small company the work was drying up and they had to lay people off. They were gonna send me home and i plead my case on why im a benefit to the company and why i should stay. Let me also add at this point they know nothing of my past because i was embarrassed by it and never shared it, as far as they were knew i was just a kid who finished highschool and didn't want to go to college.

&#x200B;

Anyways they keep me on and start teaching me new things. Mainly all the technical side of the industry. I was taught how to test and trouble shoot antenna systems. So me and a co-worker who had been there 5 years longer than me were tasked with testing cell towers for another company under contract. It was pretty new to both of us but i worked so hard on learning all of it and even researching it on my own time.

&#x200B;

After about 8 months the company who was hiring my company to do the testing was requesting only me out to the sites since i did a good job and was very quick. Once i found this out i negotiated a pay raise to $18 and i got a company vehicle that i was able to take home. Around this time my brothers job brought him into the area since he was leading a project at a local military base repairing all of their water system. And he bought a house and i moved in with him which worked great. Paying $600 a month in rent to him. Little did i know this would benefit me so much down the road. I always kinda idolized my brother. He was a great people persons, everyone loved him. He knew how to talk to girls, he was really smart and he always tried to be a father figure to me when my dad was absent.

&#x200B;

I did this for a about 2 years working an average of 60-65 hours a week. Going above and beyond, and never missing a day of work. Hell i didn't take a sick day for 2 years and was never late and worked every weekend they asked me to even if it was last minute. Well i started to get run down after doing that almost everyday for 2 years and asked for a raise and they pushed me to $23. And we ended up losing our contract with that company testing cell towers. They started doing it themselves to cut down on cost.

&#x200B;

Well a big project came up in DC that was over a year long and my boss choose me to run the whole thing. He really believed in my work ethic. I was the only person there from my company that was experienced, we hired on 6 temp workers who had no experience. I trained them all on every aspect of our job and we completed the job ahead of schedule and everyone was praising me. At this point i was turning 26 and was going to be dropped from my dads health coverage. I called my boss and said i really want a raise i need $25 an hour since ill have to provide my own health care. Well he gave me $25 an hour and the company since we were growing picked up a health insurance plan, as well as 401k with match.

&#x200B;

Once the job ended we got a bit slow again but i started working in the office doing wireless communication designs. Designing DAS systems for a major carrier in all sorts of venues. Office buildings, Stadiums, Concert halls etc... And i picked it up really quick. After about 5 months i was doing all the major designs our company got by myself practically, only asking the engineers in the office for advise when needed.

i end up doing this for quite a while at least 2 years and in that time i found a girlfriend and she ended up unexpectedly getting pregnant. I swear when she told me my life flashed before my eyes. I just didn't think i was at all capable of taking care of a kid i didn't think it was the right time. But we decided to keep it even though we had only been dating for 6 months at the time.

&#x200B;

I just keep busting my ass but i knew i had to make more money. The cost of living here is high and although i had amassed 16k in savings while living with my brother, he was moving to another state. His job had moved again and he wanted to sell the house we lived in now. He ended up renting it to me for a discount, and i actually still live here right now (although im moving in feb.) but it was still more money then i had been spending.

&#x200B;

The baby and frivolous spending with my new girlfriend caused me to almost drain my bank account. We hired some new employees that had experience but were from another company. I found out they were making more than me while doing way less skilled work. This kind of made me resent my company a bit, i wasn't mad at my co-workers hell everyone should fight for as much money as they can. But i was mad at the office, i didn't feel appreciated. I was employee of the years 2 years prior (the only time we ever had an empoloyee of the year) everybody at the company admitted i had the best work ethic etc..

&#x200B;

Well a little over a month ago i was contacted by a headhunter. Someone who worked under me at the big DC project years ago used me as a reference. At the end of the call he asked me about my skill set and said he had some opportunities for me. Well he ended up connecting me with a bigger company in the same area who does very similar work. I had an interview with them for a field tech position (commissioning das sites) and at the interview i blew them away. They actually had me come to a 2nd interview the next week instead now i was interviewing for the Design Engineer role and the CTO sat in on the interview. I completely nailed that interview as well.

&#x200B;

And a week later i got an offer for a position 75k Base salary plus all benefits. I talked with my family and decided it was the right move. I didn't want to get into a bid war with my current company and i thought it would be bad etiquette to say ""I was offered XX amount, what can you guys do for me"". So instead i wrote out a formal two week notice and sent it in.

&#x200B;

My company was shocked, my co-workers all said they don't know what the company would do without me. I practically can do everything there. My immediate boss asked if there is anything he can do to make me stay. And not wanting to get into a bid war i said no. Next week i was in the office and the owner says ""What do you need to want to stay here"" I told him the same thing and he ended up telling me to sleep on it and talk to him the next day.

&#x200B;

Well the next day im at the office doing a design and he pulls me aside to talk to me. He says they really appreciate everything that i do and he wants me to stay for all the right reasons. He said he would give me the title of 'Design Engineer' and 85k a year base salary with annual bonuses. I was a little shocked. I knew they would make an offer to keep me, but i didn't expect it to be 10k more. Plus i already have a take home vehicle with them which they pay insurance, gas, maintenance etc. Which i wouldn't get at the other company. So total compensation is like 92-93k a year.

Last year i only made 53k total for the year at $25 an hour. This is a 30k raise and its guaranteed salary. I always thought i was under paid but now i really feel i'm getting what i deserve now. And man it feels good.

Sorry for the super long rant. I just feel really good. Although i never tried to care what people thought of me because i know i'm a good person and work hard. I always felt out shadowed by my siblings, it feels so good to hit this milestone and be able to better provide for me and my family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dqjqrb/from_highschool_dropout_to_85k_a_year/,4176,Wow.

And I'm not talking about being a millionaire or even making 100k a year. My life would be completely different if I just made like 50k a year.  I could afford to buy a car. I could afford to have my own apartment (maybe). I could afford to buy good recording equipment and record an album. I could afford to buy a road bike and get into triathlons... I could afford the crazy entry fees for triathlons. I could afford to do most normal activities.

I'm actually stuck when I try to figure out the problems I have that don't require money. I don't think there are any at all. I'm active, well adjusted and friendly.

251,9qf37o,False,None,460,I just wanted to let you guys know about an opportunity.,povertyfinance,"Did you know there's an electrician shortage? Did you know you don't have to pay to become one? (Well. You'll have to pay for books and tools but hey) That you can actually get paid more than minimum wage to work and learn on the job as an apprentice? The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Commitee, or JATC, have an office in just about every major city you can think of. They'll start you off at 50% of a journeyman's pay in your area to work and learn on the job, and you'll get a raise about every 6 months if you're consistent! In my town the JATC would start me at $9.85, and as far as I know that's actually a little! My cousin lives in OKC, the apprenticeship there starts at $15.90!! keep in mind this is a 5 year commitment, it is a career after all. But after those 5 years you have a career. You'll have a long lasting trade that won't go anywhere for a very long time. I'm always reading people being recommended to become a welder, or trucker and that they make killings. Although I agree they make way more money than I do, look it up, those guys are on their way out. their jobs are gonna be automated sooner rather than later. I'd hate for you to take a year or 2 to become a trucker just to lose your job in the next decade. But electricians and plumbers are looking like they're gonna be the last trades to be automated. since electricians get paid a hair more than plumbers, maybe try checking out the JATC in your area and see how much apprentices start at? Your only requirements are a diploma or GED and proof that you passed Algebra with a C or higher in your high school transcripts. If you didn't pass algebra, there's a cute little Algebra test they supply you with to get get that credit. I see people here struggling with minimum wage, or people here who can't afford school. I'm here to tell you guys that I'm in that same boat. And I just found out there's a *demand* for apprentices, meaning they're just begging us to consider it. Tests are every 6 months so if you hurry you might make it to take the January test an start by early 2019. Stay safe guys :) 


Edit: just wanted to give you guys some info off the bat I found was important to know. The first few years are most expensive bc that's when you're buying the most books + all your tools. So expect some money to be needed for that. Also the reports that say you'll be a journeyman in 5 years and the actual requirements to take the journeyman test make it out to be 30 hours of supervised work and 5 hours of classroom schooling a week for 5 years. Depending on whether or not they'll allow you to work overtime this means you can either amp up apprentice work to progress through those 5 years faster or pick up another job to supplement book and tool fees as you wait for those first few raises to kick in.

For those of you who have been following my posts, you may know i started my career in security as a homeless man. Early last year, I got myself out of homelessness. 

Shortly after the pandemic, my leaseholder went awol. Won't answer phones, text messages, emails, nothing.

Today the property owner came, demanding his back rent. Despite explaining the situation, showing him proof, and practically begging for time, the man was adamant that we had to pay if we wanted to stay here.

Since none of us can come up with $6000 and I'm still looking for steady work, we will all likely be kicked out.

The other three have somewhere else to go. I don't. So for me, it's back to the shelter.

one of my clients has a real estate attorney in my inbox giving me some useful information. Turns out, even if there wasn't a pandemic, the landlord is going to have a Hard time evicting us.

I can't say I know the specific laws he's using, but one of the people here is a saleswoman. So she's gonna work her magic and see what can be done.

Meanwhile, I've been binge applying to every company I can find. Flipping burgers, serving coffee, executive protection service, bag boy, p\*\*\* star, Consultant, Food distribution at a food bank, you name it. I haven't slept yet so that's a factor working on me. Let's see what happens.

Hi everyone,

I know this virus situation has put many of us out of work, especially as restaurants around the USA are closing. If you're looking for a new job or to supplement your income during this time, I really encourage you to check out Palfish. I've taught on there for about three years and logged 1000+ hours of teaching.

**You need to be a native English speaker, but you don't need a bachelor's degree, unlike all other high-paying teaching platforms. You don't need to speak Chinese, either.**

Mostly, it's playing interactive English games with the kids while correcting their pronunciation. You're provided the lesson materials, so there's no prep work. You need stable internet and a phone/tablet. You set your own schedule for classes. It‚Äôs a real job, so yes, you will have to go through an application process, which typically takes a few days.

Here is a google doc I made with a lot more in-depth info and some overview of what the classroom/lessons look like, if you'd like to read in more detail.

**Quick-start guide:**  [https://teachpalfish.weebly.com/](https://teachpalfish.weebly.com/) 

**If you do plan on doing Palfish, please read the guide carefully so that you pass your interview.**

You can download the app here - I'll get a notification on my Palfish account and I will walk you through the process. (I get a bonus if you join using my link, full disclosure!). Just figured I'd make a post here for those who are affected by this very unfortunate virus outbreak. (By the way, if there's some kind of pop up, it's probably due to it being a Chinese web page. It's safe.)

**Download the app:** [https://ipalfish.i2mi.com/klian/web/dist/m/teacher/invite.html?uid=2226133&channel=30001&teacherregion=0](https://ipalfish.i2mi.com/klian/web/dist/m/teacher/invite.html?uid=2226133&channel=30001&teacherregion=0)

I hope you found this post and the quick-start guide helpful, I wish you all safety and health during this time.

260,dc43in,False,None,240,"Are you worried about ""lifestyle creep"" as you slowly increase your income, decrease your debt, and claw your way out of poverty? Refer to... ""The Raw Asshole Rule.""",povertyfinance,"This is a common question we have around here. You get a job making a few more bucks an hour. You finally pay off that debt. You have a little more money than you used to have, but maybe not a lot more. And you start to wonder... is it okay if I increase my budget a little bit and improve my standard of living? Or, since I've been living without this money for so long, should I save it and avoid the dreaded ""lifestyle creep?""

Go by the ""Raw Asshole Rule.""

The Raw Asshole Rule refers to what using cheap one-ply toilet paper every day does to your asshole. When that's all you can afford, you live with a raw asshole. It's not pleasant or comfortable, but you deal with it because you have to. When you are making enough money to afford the nicer toilet paper, you are absolutely justified in doing so. It's not lifestyle creep or extravagance to not want to live with a raw asshole.

Other things can be raw assholes, too. If your shitty beater car is barely safe to drive and constantly in need of repair, that's a raw asshole. You're justified in getting a safer and more reliable car. If your mattress is older than you are and you're always waking up sore, that's a raw asshole. You're justified in buying a new mattress. If your current grocery situation is unhealthy or leaves you feeling gross and miserable, that's a raw asshole. You're justified in upping the grocery budget. See what I'm saying? 

And those are just some obvious/common examples. Even seemingly frivolous things can be raw assholes, if they're important to you. If your wardrobe is threadbare and makes you feel ugly or ashamed, that can be a raw asshole. If you haven't had the money to spend on a social life or a hobby, and that has left you depressed/isolated/unfulfilled, that can be a raw asshole. Anything that consistently negatively impacts your daily functioning, that makes you unhappy every day, can be a raw asshole.

Here's the true genius of the Raw Asshole Rule: if your cheap toilet paper makes your ass raw, you don't immediately jump to wiping your ass with 100% silk sheets. You buy the store-brand Charmin knockoff - just enough to stop your ass from bleeding. Apply that to everything else. Don't buy a brand-new car - buy a safer, more reliable used car. Don't buy a $5k Tempur-Pedic - buy a $300 mattress and a $60 topper. And so on and so forth. This is /r/povertyfinance; y'all don't need advice on how to stretch a dollar. The point is, you don't need the nicest, most expensive stuff to stop your ass from bleeding.

It is cruel to expect someone to live with a raw asshole in the name of saving a few extra bucks. Getting out of poverty, and enjoying the small comforts that allows, is not lifestyle creep. Lifestyle creep only becomes an issue if you're spending money beyond what is necessary to make your asshole stop bleeding. 

So if you're in this spot? Just prioritize the things that make your asshole bleed the most. And enjoy that soft new toilet paper.

And the obvious caveat: Apply the Raw Asshole Rule within a reasonable budget that allows you to continue making progress towards your current financial goals. How you prioritize and budget these things will be unique to your own situation. This isn't permission to blow your emergency fund. It *is* permission to stop feeling guilty about buying fresh veggies instead of canned, or moving to the more expensive apartment in the safer neighborhood. Continue to have a healthy respect for your future, to make sure you never have to go back to using one-ply toilet paper.

261,hr7wyr,False,Misc Advice,764,"If you had one REAL tip for people who are barely getting by, what would it be?",povertyfinance,"Let's face it, frugal tips written by people who aren't truly poor are pretty awful.  Stuff like don't go to Starbucks is insulting and hurtful when your bank account is all but empty and you just need to figure out how to feed your kids this week.  Things like start a garden also don't help much if you need food now.  Even less helpful are the people who live on homesteads with a huge garden and some chickens writing about how they spent less than $50 a week at the grocery store to feed their family of 8.  Yeah, anybody could do that if they had their own freaking farm :D

So, what are your REAL tips for getting by?

I have a few:

1. Barter child care if possible.  When I was in college, I had two young kids.  I was able to trade babysitting with a neighbor.  She watched my kids in the morning when I was at school.  I watched hers in the evening when she worked second shift.
2. Yard sales tend to be much better in expensive neighborhoods.  From my experience, sales in poorer neighborhoods have higher prices because somebody is trying to scrape up enough money to pay a bill.  In richer neighborhoods, it seems people just want the stuff gone, and they really don't care so much about the money.
3. You can stretch meals by adding more pasta, beans, rice or vegetables.  I would typically double a recipe except for the meat in things like casseroles or pasta dishes.  Example: If your chili recipe calls for 2 cans of beans, put in 4.
4. Find a library and use it.  Libraries are more than books.  They are air conditioned in the summer and a good place to go with your kids to beat the heat.  They often have clubs and activities that you can join too.  (Granted, Covid makes this tricky right now)
5. You really need to start stockpiling food whenever possible.  When you are flush, get a few more packages of pasta, some sauce, some tuna, etc.  Then, when your electric bill comes due and it's going to eat most of your paycheck, at least you'll have a bit of food in the house.  When I was really broke, I learned that saving food was better than saving money.  Something would always come along that needed whatever extra dollars I had.  But, food in the pantry was a true asset.
6. When you're shopping for groceries, think in terms of meals.  Shop the sales rather than trying to plan your menu in advance.  One whole chicken can give you three meals.  
7. Prioritizing bills generally is in shut off order.  You'll get a feel for who is the most lenient and who will shut off your service in a heartbeat.  This means your priority needs to be housing, food, water, electricity and heat.  Credit cards, medical bills and entertainment come after those basics.  
8. Help others whenever you possibly can.  I can't tell you how many times a friend, relative or neighbor saved my butt when I needed a ride to the store, or a few dollars to keep the lights on.  Build up goodwill and karma.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/hr7wyr/if_you_had_one_real_tip_for_people_who_are_barely/,3690,You will stay poor till you get educated ...only the stupid are poor. ,2020-07-14 19:17:51

**Other Helpful Tips**

* If you are homeless, try to scrape together some money for a $10 gym membership to Planet Fitness if you can. That's at least one month of a place where you have access to free bathrooms and showers.

* /u/RUfuqingkiddingme would like to remind you that if you are in the US, you can dial 211 to be connected to your local resources!

* Don't forget to also find your local town/city/state/neighboring cities subreddits! There are redditors everywhere that can help you/that are giving away things, and these will be more knowledgeable about local resources as well.

* In my time working for Starbucks, I learned that a LOT of pastries get thrown out at the end of every day, as well as the lunch boxes and sandwiches that expire the next day. I would bring BAGS full of food to some of the homeless near my old apartment. Go to your local Starbucks in the evening when it's slow and ask an employee if they would be allowed to give you any of these things, I'm sure they wouldn't mind. If they say no, please be courteous and polite to them as it's likely not their fault and more of a management decision at that facility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/a0uk6s/greetings_fellow_poors_i_wanted_to_compile_a_list/,3683,Godsend. ,2018-11-27 12:51:48

269,cvy12h,False,None,240,Dodged the Generational Poverty Trap Today,povertyfinance,"I'm a big student of generational poverty behaviors in my own quest to educate  myself to be more sustainable, but also to share with the low-income people I work with.

So today my sister texts me and says she needs $400 to pay her power bill.

I look at my bank account in my usual knee jerk reaction to her crises and I just paid for my car registration and it had tanked me to just having my rent and bills in the account for the end of the month with only 1/2 a paycheck coming from my new job and I have no idea how much it will be after taxes.  I also have money I can't withdraw in my savings w/o a penalty (which I should've never told ANYONE in my family about.)

I think and think because I don't want her kids to go without power since she is so behind.  So I offer to pay her bill on a credit card I basically have thrown in a box in the back of the garage for emergencies only if she promises to pay me back by the end of Sept.

She says ""oh, no..I'll just get a payday loan!""

So I am ""No, that is terrible, let me pay for it! The payday loan people will take 25% of your check at least! Just give me the info and I'll go online and pay..""

""Its ok...I'll call you if it doesn't work out.""

So...

**She really didn't have a bill to pay - she just wanted me to hand her a stack of cash and let her ""pay"" it.**

I hope other people can sympathize.  I fall prey to my family wanting money pretty easily, but an old mentor told me once, which I should've remembered, ""always pay the bill, never hand over the cash.""

He said he learned this because he used to do it and he'd see his sister or cousin walking around with a new Coach purse or a new TV.  And that is the epitome of generational poverty thinking - soothe the pain and lack of resources by impulse buys and entertainment, vs saving up and using windfalls to take care of things like utilities, doctors, dentists, and so forth.

Because family thinks you owe them..and maybe in some ways we do - but I can't subsidize her knowing she's not going to use it help her kids.

*\[Update\] I love to see people talking about this and sharing our experiences.  The worst think about having a trauma in our lives is the feeling we have to hide it or the people in our lives just won't understand.  When I work with new groups of teens this is the most powerful activity we do - to share our collective experiences and realize we aren't alone.*

*So my big ""confession"" here is that up until I was about 28, I used to panic and ask family members for money.  I'm not saying all the time, but I certainly didn't have a credit card (because my mother told me they were evil) so I didn't have credit.  I lived off my social abilities and whatever I needed, from housing to food I got from real people.*

*Earlier in my 20s, I would steal or take things just ""laying around"" because I ""needed"" them and people weren't using them so it was a waste.  I lied whenever anyone confronted me.*   
 *I lied a lot because I didn't think who I was was interesting enough and when it was discovered I either exaggerated or I had ""borrowed"" something.  And I took advantage of every low-income program I could (as I was taught.)  It got me through college, I have considerable loans I am working on public forgiveness for, and I was able to survive.   And for awhile, as low-income students do, I was on food stamps. I also dumpster dived a good deal and went to the Food Bank for food once a month.  Then I cut out the middle-man and opened a food bank at my college.*

*BUT when I finished my MA I impulsively moved in with my ex and we ran off to Vancouver, CA - I had a breaking point.  I am not sure what did it (it might've been I found out the 5k I sent to pay back my Mom for a car repair was pocketed by my Dad. For three years she was mad I didn't pay her back!!! I'm still angry as hell at him.)*

*I realized when I had been begging my parents for money since we couldn't cover the bills and suddenly I was like NO MORE.  NO MORE asking for money! I AM AN ADULT! I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS!!!!!! So since that day I've never asked my parent, a friend, or anyone for money and I've prospered to some degree.  Even when I had to live on two cans of ravioli and a pack of Dollar General cookies - I kept it together, paid my bills, went to work, and pushed hard to work my way up the ladder. I still have problems - but I've been pushing myself to act like a middle-class person and be more aggressive about my self-interest and my rights.  I was taught to be passive, slip behind the scenes, and fade into the background; when I really was a performer and a fighter.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/cvy12h/dodged_the_generational_poverty_trap_today/,3655,[removed] ,2019-08-27 02:20:51

You can also check out my post on [using apps to save money and earn cash back](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperSecretSpare/comments/au5am7/saving_money_online_in_2019/).

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).

Time investment required for these numbers: 30-40 hours a week. Feel free to work less or more. 40 hours a week is only a requirement if you want to make over $1,000 following this guide.

Tech required for these numbers: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), and an internet connection. Alternatively, just go to the library a few hours a day.

This is a slightly modified and edited post that I made on another sub. I know that when I was trying to improve my life, working online opened a lot of additional doors for me. I was able to eat when I wanted instead of when I could afford it, I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner, and have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates.

Working online is something that pretty much anyone can do. If you are already browsing Reddit, you have the tools to make additional income. I am including payment proof as well as direct links to all of the sites, so everyone can see that it is actually possible and get started today. These are all legit sites and I have not been scammed or jipped by any of them for any amount. Feel free to do your own research about their trustworthiness if need be. 

This is by no means a comprehensive guide to everything you can do online to make extra cash, nor is this really that impressive a number to make. This does not include some of the more well known sites like swagbucks or earnhoney, as I just do not like them that much. It does not include sites like Rat Race or Appen. It also does not include tutoring Chinese kids with some of the well known sites. This is more a quick overview of how I personally boosted my monthly income by almost $1,000 a month working with six different websites. While I am in America, many of these sites can be used worldwide. Hopefully someone can find a new revenue stream through this write-up.

The times I have invested vary greatly, from one or two hours a day to well over 12 hours a day. I average somewhere around $6.25 an hour (admittedly never giving it 100% attention),  but to me that is better than making nothing an hour. While it may seem excessive some days, I actually enjoy making money and I do some of it while I am at my day job, so it has become more of a time filler than actual work. Everyone will have their own experience but these are what have worked the best for me, either in time investment or having a little fun along the way.

**SwagBucks** ($225) Surveys ‚Äì Majority of countries‚Äì This is more of a catch-all for stuff to do when you want to make and save money. You can do surveys, play games, and watch videos to earn points. You can also get cash back from using SB to visit and buy from different stores. You get paid in points which can be used to purchase gift cards or sent directly to PayPal. Each point is the equivalent of $0.01. Usually, SB will have deals where you can get certain gift cards for less. For example, a $20 Amazon gift card for 1800 SB points. The payout can be slow, but if you don‚Äôt mind running ads in the background, using a plug-in to save money while you shop, or killing time playing a game, SwagBucks can be a great way to earn $20 a month. [SwagBucks](https://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=50837036)

**Mturk** ([$2,400](https://imgur.com/1EPHq64)): This is by far the one I spend the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved. www.mturk.com

**Respondent.io** ([$1,300](https://imgur.com/a/ITb6G)): This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, easily averaging $125 per test. I only average getting approved for the groups about 10% of the time (I have filled out about 200 screeners and have been selected for 20 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. [www.respondent.io](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11)

**Usertesting** ([$600](https://imgur.com/sxUwXW8)): This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. www.usertesting.com

**Redbubble** ([$60](https://imgur.com/wobuyuz)): [My store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/7secondman). After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, clocks, mugs, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. I have only been at this one for about two months, but see the potential it has. It also takes a good amount of upfront work before you see any dividends. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. www.redbubble.com

**PlaytestCloud** ($150): This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal. No payment proof available as it is not all saved in one place. www.playtestcloud.com

**Reddit subs**($400): From test driving cars, to doing homework, to rating businesses, these subs have been a catch all for when I have any extra time to go through them. Honestly, this has probably been the third best pay per hour of work out of everything, after Respondent and Prolific. I just wish there were gigs to find all day. Be careful not to get scammed here. Some people are just... something else. 

Check out r/beermoney, r/workonline, r/slavelabour, and r/jobs4bitcoins. 

Well, that is all I have for now. I hope someone can get something from this. Feel free to share any other revenue streams you may have and feel free to ask any questions you may have. I will answer the best I can.

Edit: This isn't a get rich quick scheme. And it isn't a way to make anywhere near minimum wage online. This post if for people willing to sacrifice free time to make a few extra bucks.

Edit II: Holy fuck, I get it. A second job would pay better. This is for people who want extra money without having to get a second job, are confined to their house for whatever reason, have unusual hours free, or for people (like me) that prefer making a bit extra sitting around in their underwear eating cereal not having to deal with other people.

Edit III: I still understand a part time job will pay way more than this. If you would rather have a part time job, or deal with the stress of deliverables and bosses, have at it. Please stop.

If your state has not expanded unemployment, please consider the following:

* APPLY ANYWAY - the number of applicants may force the government to take action to deal with the financial burden in their state.

* Contact your Governor's Office and request that he take action

* Contact your state representatives (state government, not federal) and ask that they take action to push the governor

* REMEMBER THIS at voting time next election if your state refuses to take action and vote in your state elections, not just the federal ones.

I won't be able to keep up with any legislation changes on a state by state basis, it's just too much for me and I'm still (thankfully) working full-time, so I've tried my best to link to pages that should update if things change. Check your state government's website frequently for social programs started or expanded to help, including SNAP/WIC/TANF benefits, or disability benefits if you get sick.

What shocks me is when they aren‚Äôt able to take a shift I‚Äôll hear chatter about how ‚Äúthey must not actually need money that much‚Äù or ‚Äúthey have their nails done/are drinking Starbucks/etc. so obviously their financial situation isn‚Äôt that bad.‚Äù

What people don‚Äôt always realize is maybe this person hasn‚Äôt had a weekend day off in months. Maybe this person has a significant milestone that day. Maybe this person was given a Starbucks gift card and couldn‚Äôt sell it. Maybe their nails are always done because that‚Äôs the once a month get together they have with their mom and she pays for it. 

I get where the skepticism comes from but it‚Äôs always important to remember things aren‚Äôt what they seem, and people deserve to have days reserved to be off no matter what their financial situation is.

321,epi2y6,False,None,357,"I finally made it out of poverty, but it came at a significant cost.",povertyfinance,"I am not saying that my path is one that anyone should take. It‚Äôs not necessarily a good way or the best way. It is different than most of what I have read on this sub, so thought I would share. Here are some things about me:

22F, mixed race, born to single teen parent and grew up really poor, chronically mentally ill.

Based off of my general demographics, it was very unlikely that I‚Äôd make it out of poverty. From the beginning I suffered from food, home and hygiene insecurity. Mental illness runs in my family. My earliest memory of being depressed started was at 8 years old. We couldn‚Äôt afford a doctor, so this manifested in my life. It was in these moments that I promised myself I would do absolutely whatever it took to get out of poverty. 

I got my first job when I was 15 and I got a taste of what it felt like to make my own money. After a life of poverty, I felt like I had power and control. At the same time I was really struggling to manage school and my mental illness. I had a terrible boyfriend at the time who made me have sex with him. I first started to see myself as a sexual object. My 4.0gpa slipped to a 3.5gpa. I decided to go to alternative school at the local community college. I was able to take college classes to get high school credits, paid for by the school district. This allowed me to have a more flexible schedule and graduate earlier with college credits. 

My home life was terrible. My parent was never around, always at work to afford my sibling and I. So I had very little supervision. I was left to my own devices and got in a lot of trouble. At 17 I ended up getting kicked out. I went and lived with a friend for a while. I will never be able to thank them enough for taking me in. I graduated and dropped out of community college for the first time. I got sick of making minimum wage and brainstormed what job I was qualified to do and paid well. The very best I could think of was being a stripper. So on my 18th birthday, I went to a strip club and auditioned. I got the job and started working. I made really good money at that job. This didn‚Äôt mean much though, considering that I was 18 and extremely irresponsible. 

I decided to give college another try, so I enrolled in the local university using student loans. I moved into the dorms and went to class for a few weeks. I dropped out my first term due to mental illness and having no support structure. 

A year passed and my boyfriend at the time had cheated on me. We broke up and I soon realized that I needed to work on myself. I was a massively depressed 19 year old stripper with no future. I was suicidal and could barely make myself get out of bed to take a shower. I pretty much just slept all day and worked enough to afford bills. 

Although my life was in shambles, I always had money. Stripping was a very lucrative job. I decided to get help for my mental illness and saw a psychiatrist. I tried various medications and it took about 5 tries to get the right one. I spent a lot of time feeling like a zombie. He prescribed me an antipsychotic and within a week I was a completely changed person. For the first time in a very long while, I felt happy. 

I kept working and when I was 20 decided to go back to college for a third time. At the time I was already 15k in debt from dropping out twice. I decided to do a technical associates degree at a local community college. The entire cost for the program was 14k. I received merit based scholarships specifically meant for technical degrees. I got these by submitting my high school transcripts and writing essays. I earned enough scholarships that I got the entire program paid for. My boyfriend at the time made me quit stripping, so I became a bikini barista. This job paid really well also, with low work hours. He made me quit that job and we broke up. 

I applied for a technical internship at a corporation in my town. It took them 3 months to get back to me and I didn‚Äôt get the job on the first try. I had to apply again and got it on the second try. I reformed a relationship with my parent and moved back in with them. At this time I met my husband. 

I worked at the internship 32 hours a week and took 20 credits for a year to finish college on time. They paid me $17 an hour. Internship wages in my profession range from $15-17 an hour typically. There was a possibility to get a job at the end of the internship, contingent on completion of my associates degree and an interview. I definitely broke down a few times, but kept pushing because it was worth it. I worked hard enough that I surpassed expectations at work and graduated with a 3.9gpa. I was hired full time at the end of my internship. I took a position as a night shift technician. There are usually incentives for working alternative schedules. This one in particular put me at 84k per year without overtime. Some might be surprised by this number, but my field of work is very specialized. There are very few women and not many people willing to do this type of work due to the safety hazards. I actually love my job and enjoy working with the hazards. I am excited to go to work every single day. A lot of people on this sub talk about not wanting a ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù job. What they don‚Äôt realized is that these jobs are often times safer than daily life. This is due to the extremely strict safety controls and procedures that are in place. Most accidents that happen in these jobs are from human error. If you are 100% committed to safety and always follow the procedure, you will be fine. I am more likely to die in a car accident on the way to work, than I am at work. 

Soon after getting the job at 21, I moved in with my boyfriend and we decided to get married. My husband has a 4 year degree and makes 82k per year, putting us at a household income of 166k. After paying off 30k of consumer debt, we budget off of one salary and save over 50% of our income. Now I am 22, working night shift and taking classes during the day. The company I work for is paying for my bachelors degree. When I complete my degree, I am going to start a need based scholarship for women in the trades at the community college I went to. 

I realized that all of this came at a significant cost. I am damaged from working as a stripper. I view myself as a sexual object and have to remind myself that I have more to offer. I am also hyper-sexual, often times without realizing it. Working as a stripper normalized hyper-sexuality for me at a young age. I have worked really hard to get this under control. 

I also have no friends. The combination of mental illness and putting in crazy hours at work/school made it pretty much impossible to have a social life. I traded a social life and social skills for money. At the time I didn‚Äôt realize that is what I was doing. I want to go out to so many places and try new things, but I don‚Äôt have a single friend to enjoy life with. Along with working night shift, it makes for a very isolating and lonely existence. I love my husband and we get along great, but it‚Äôs not healthy for him to be my only friend. I‚Äôm working on that right now. I have my first girl date this Saturday.

327,d7am4s,False,None,223,Hardest 3 Years of my Life,povertyfinance,"I have been wanting to post for a while and didn't feel comfortable doing do in other subs. But here... I think you would understand. And I just want to finally tell someone, anyone, what I've secretly been going through.

3 years ago, I lost my career path. No warning. Savings cushioned the blow, but only for so long. I grew up poor poor, so I switched to hardcore frugal mode. Local market was flooded with applicants after the oil bubble popped in our region, so finding jobs was difficult. As savings dried up, I took what I could get. I got a minimum wage job, but full time and benefits. Better than some. Better than part time. It was something, and I held on for dear life.

Literally my income was half of what it had been. I sold off stuff and minimized everything. I penny pinched. I still managed to make payments, negotiating dates when I had to. A few tight months messed me up with my CC, but I had no choice.

I studied online courses and decided to upgrade as much as I could. I applied for different jobs in my company, and accepted a lateral move with zero pay upgrade in order to get more experience. It was more work, harder and my boss was insufferable. But, I needed the experience.

Then, I got sick. For months I put it off and kept going to work. I couldn't lose my job. Until one day I couldn't walk. I was vomitting from pain. I was hospitalized. I nearly died. I had an autoimmune disease, and it presented as organ damage. It had gone on so long that I had a systematic infection.

I've never been in such pain before. This pain was off the charts. Kidney stones were a walk in the park compared to that. Words can even describe it. 

I was medicated and treated, but I refused to take disability. I think that was one reason I pulled through. I had to. 

I went back to work. I kept my job. I kept doing my courses. I battled pain every day from the damage. I lost 25lbs (I'm normally 5'6"", 135lbs female).

I kept going, because I didn't want to lose everything. I got a better doctor and support group. I started to recover. Then I got a small raise! I got moved to a department that taught me new things.

After 2.5 years, I starting applying for higher wage positions. Internal and external. I suffered a relapse and was hospital admitted again.

Then, I got a phone call from the job I wanted most.

""Interview? Tomorrow?""

I accepted, and signed myself out of the hospital. I went to the interview the next day.

I nailed it, and got the job. While hiding toe-curling pain.

I used my banked vacation hours to finish my stay at the hospital and use that time to recover as best I could. I started my first day at my new job still in a state of organ distress, but I was slowly improving. Not enough to need a hospital.

This past year has been the hardest one of my life. I literally thought I wasn't going to make it.

And I pushed through it all. 

This new job nets me an extra $750/month takehome more than I was used to making before. (Which might not be huge for some regions, but it's huge for me)

I cried over my first deposit. I literally didn't know what to do with the money for the first month. I just left it in my account for the first two weeks, because I wasn't used to seeing three digits after bills. I bought real cheese for the first time in a year. I remember that. Smoked gouda. 

Even making minimum wage for 3 years, I paid down $1k on my CC ($669 left), $2.6k on my LOC ($7.7k left), kept my car, kept my housing and kept my cat. 

Nobody around me can understand this battle. I survived. I'm not out of the woods yet, but I survived. And I guess I just wanted to tell someone. That I'm proud of myself. That I have never fought harder. And, for once in my life, it paid off. 


Tl:dr; Lost my job, burned through savings, went hardcore frugal mode, upgraded, got sick and still managed to get back on my feet after nearly dying





Edit: I should explain a bit of background. I'm being asked why I didn't ask for help....

Well, because that was my entire life growing up. I was poor poor. Mom was a single parent. No child support. No family nearby. I remember the food bank. I remember my mom on the phone with so many people. I remember her crying when we would get declined or if it wasn't processed properly. I remember the day we got escourted out of our apartment and moved to a different one due to qualification issues. I remember the day I got Fruit Loops in a food bank box and I would eat only 4 pieces by hand to make it last, because I never knew if I would ever get it again. I recieved hand-me-down clothes my entire life and never bought new ones until my first job at 16. Even after I got a job, it went to the house. I had to help dig my mom out. And I did. I paid for the down payment on her house by 20. I helped get us out, because I had to.

And I swore I would fight tooth and nail to never have to experience that again. It destroyed my mother, and if I could avoid reaching that point, I would. 

It was my back-burner option. If my efforts failed. If I lost work again. If my housing was threatened. But, I couldn't do it first. It sounds like pride, but it's better to explain it as a fear. I was afraid of putting my faith in others. I couldn't go down that route until I had exhausted all opinions. And it never came to that, although it was close a few times.

Fear is a hell of a motivator.


2nd EDIT:

No, I'm not advocating people kill themselves to try and push through illmess or refuse assistance when they get sick. WTF. Everyone needs to deal with their own situations their own way.

Seems the only things that make the front page are images of paid off student loans and images of credit scores. In general, these things aren‚Äôt very helpful. Most people can‚Äôt even implement the methods in such posts... e.g., get a job paying 80k/year, live with parents, etc... because they are unattainable for most.

I would rather someone post about how to find ways to save money or stay sane... For example, my wife and I saved tons of money buying baby things on the Facebook marketplace. I highly recommend over Craigslist.

Edit: As I keep mentioning in the comments (and pointed out above), people should post their successes.

334,dmztkh,False,None,160,I grew up poor with no knowledge on how to properly manage my finances. 65K in debt at 29yrs old.,povertyfinance,"Like the title says, I grew up poor. Today my dad is a homeless addict alcoholic and my mother lives on a disability check for her mental illness. Thankfully I was driven at a young age and went to college for my nursing degree. I had to work full time so I did all my prerequisite classes part time. After 8 years of going to school off and on, I became a nurse. I now have 51K in student loan debt, 3K in a car loan, 5K personal loan, and 6K in credit card/collection debt. Everything is high interest (my car is 9%!!). My credit score has been horrible since I let a bunch of bills go to collection in my early 20s- most of which I've paid off. I always thought that once I was a nurse, I'd have the money to pay everything off. 

After almost 4 years of struggling I became horribly depressed. My friend from nursing school were buying homes, paying for weddings, going on luxurious vacations, having babies.... and here I was calling the gas company begging them not to shut my gas off. I felt as if I was drowning and unable to catch my breath. I knew I had to do something differently. 

At this point, I had already sold anything worth money. I cut my bills to a minimum- I don't have cable or a fancy phone. I dont have designer purses or shoes. I rarely eat out or buy Starbucks. I have been eating SO much rice and beans. My only option was to get a better paying job. I quit my clinic job where I worked 4-10hr shifts, no weekends, nights, or holidays and took a job working 12hr night shift in the hospital about a month and a half ago (yay working weekends and holidays...). Way more stress. Way sicker patients. But I had to do it. I also have opportunities for overtime.

1.5 months in to this new job and I have been able to get current on all my bills. This is HUGE for me. I paid off one of my 4 credit cards (it was only a $300 limit but a start) and a $175 collection. I have started to build an emergency fund. I've set aside a modest amount for Christmas. I am finally seeing some light. 65K is going to be one hell if a mountain to tackle but I want financial freedom more than anything. My mental health needs this. My goal is to build a $1500 emergency fund and pay off all credit cards by March 2020. That alone will save me hundreds of dollars a month in credit card payments that I can put toward my car, personal loan, and eventually my student loans. 

I refuse to follow my parents footsteps. I will take care of my mental health. I have this amazing career and I will not let it go to waste. Who ever said money can't buy happiness has never been poor. I dont need money to buy me expensive things I need financial security. I need to be able to buy food, pay my gas bill, pay for my health insurance and afford the copays and deductibles. I dont have any late bills this month and it feels so fucking great.

As of March 2018 my credit card debt was at an all time high of $2700 and I felt so ashamed of it. Between March 1st and today, July 16th, I have paid it all off!  

I got a much higher paying job that started March 1st and have been dumping as much of each of my checks into my credit card balance as I possibly could. For reference - my last check was about $1200 and I put like $719 towards paying off my card. I would be happy to go in more detail about the payments I made if anyone is interested. 

I am even more proud to say that I did this all while not missing any payments on my other bills. I am pregnant with my first child that is due in October and I was SO determined to have this eliminated before the baby arrives. Now until I go on maternity leave I can create some savings and breathe a bit more. 

I have learned my lesson and will never let this happen again! It was a bad combo of a few big bills piling up on each other close together and staying too long at a job I really enjoyed - but didn‚Äôt pay enough. Lesson definitely learned!

I started having symptoms of a bladder infection, and didn‚Äôt want to go to the ER and have another huge debt I can‚Äôt pay. Was looking up possible home remedies and stumbled onto the app called K Health. Looked up reviews, and saw it was mentioned in some legit publications back when it was apparently just a symptom checker. After making sure no one was labeling it as a scam online, I decided I could risk the $14 to try to talk to a doctor on the app, and worst case I could still go to the ER.

It was 100% worth it. Was connected to a doctor within 10 minutes, and the chat was pretty quick too. We went over all of my symptoms, and the doctor asked about several other symptoms to make sure all bases were covered. He was confident enough in the symptoms to start treatment without a urinalysis, but offered to order labs if I wanted them. I opted to not do labs, so he sent a prescription to the pharmacy of my choice. I called the pharmacy to be extra sure they got it and I wasn‚Äôt just scammed, and they did receive the prescription. 

I also downloaded the GoodRX app that a pharm tech told me about the last time I had to get an expensive prescription. Got a coupon for the antibiotic. It was around $56 before the coupon, and is $10.78 with the coupon.

So in the end I paid $24.78 total to speak to a doctor and get a prescription, And aside from going to pick up my prescription soon, and frequent bathroom visits for my broken bladder, I haven‚Äôt even left my bed all morning. Amazing. I highly recommend both of these apps if you need medications, but can‚Äôt afford to visit your doctor. Or even if your copay for your insurance is more than the $14 fee this app charges. 

Tl;dr: You can talk to a doctor on the K Health app for $14 no matter if you do or don‚Äôt have insurance. Also, GoodRX is wicked awesome for huge discounts for medications.

Not everyone is taught how to budget at home, not everyone is resourceful enough to figure it out on their own.

I went ahead and looked up each service to verify they are legit, and listed the basic details of each one. 

As always, shop around. Depending on what you need, some services may be cheaper than others.

*        Includes cleanser and moisturizer.
*        Includes 2 minute skincare routine to follow with the above products.


With any prescription that is more than you‚Äôre able to afford, you should also ask your pharmacist about alternative options, as they likely know something cheaper, or they can point out an over-the-counter medication or supplement that can help in the meantime if you can‚Äôt afford a doctor. I‚Äôve personally had my pharmacist show me what over the counter medications would help with anxiety medication withdrawal that happens with certain anxiety and depression medications when you stop taking it. They helped me pick a vitamin that would help keep the anxiety at bay a bit so I didn‚Äôt have a complete breakdown while waiting for more meds. Pharmacists are a fantastic resource, and they‚Äôre happy to help.

Also, try applying for free healthcare. It is available for people in hardship, and there is no shame in getting help from the government when you need it. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to just see if you qualify. I‚Äôve used it before, and it can help relieve a little of the stress from poverty to at least know you‚Äôre covered if something happens.

I recently attended an event at a church where they were giving away new and used coats, boots, and other warm winter gear. Everything was donated. I have actually donated to this program several years in a row when I was doing well. I got there early and while waiting in line I overheard a couple talking. The girl was going over what brands to look for because the local used clothing store only buys certain brands. Once inside, I noticed there were 5 brand new winter coats. The couple each took one along with some others they had found. I tried on a medium one and it didn‚Äôt fit so I put it back. Immediately the girl came and took it. By this time she had her arms full and so did her boyfriend. I asked her if she found a large coat and she said yes but needed it for her large family. I ended up leaving with nothing as did many others. Those two pretty much cleared the place out. They left with 2 garbage bags and headed straight for the store where you sell clothes. I wasn‚Äôt following them, I had to catch a bus across from the store. I just cannot believe how selfish and greedy some people can be. They let people freeze so that they could get money. Who knows what they needed the money for, but with the way things are around here, I would guess drugs. I really feel sorry for the people who waited out in the cold with me only to leave without a coat. With the amount that couple took, we all could have had warm winter coats.

I actually cried.,povertyfinance,"I've been working in this factory for about two years now, and as much as I like the job it has been hard to make ends meet with my ongoing debt and alcohol problems. I've mostly been sticking with it because it's frightening to abandon a sure thing for something unknown, especially when I have no real savings or anything to fall back on, but I won't pretend that there are a lot of opportunities out there for someone like me anyhow.

I was asked to come see the factory heads this week to talk about something, and I was terrified. I thought I was going to be reprimanded or even fired - that everything I had feared was finally coming home to roost, and that all my attempts to ward it off or make up for it had collapsed. Instead, they told me that they had noticed I've been the common factor in my line-team's success for quite a while now, and that they wanted to give me a raise to reflect it. It wasn't much, just another dollar an hour, but the practical upshot of it is that it will basically pay for my groceries each week on its own. 

I've spent the last two years in revenue neutrality at best, making just enough to survive while saving nothing. This new money is going to be enough to let me go back on the anti-depressants I had to abandon, or maybe even get an appointment or two with someone to help work through my addiction again. I don't know if my bosses know that I'm an alcoholic or not (there are many other people on the floor who are, and for whom it's an open secret with everyone else who works here), but they've still given me a real chance here that I do not intend to fuck up.

369,dx26dq,False,None,472,I ate like a food stamps person for a WHOLE DAY!!!!,povertyfinance,"(If that title made you want to strangle a rich people...then you know exactly where I‚Äôm coming from)

You know all those videos where they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúI ATE LIKE A POOR PERSON FOR A WEEK: HERE‚ÄôS WHAT HAPPENED!!!‚Äù Those people have no idea. $5 a day? Try $2-3 a day. With a $20 grocery budget (and that‚Äôs being generous!) I can manage sandwiches, pasta, canned vegetables, and lots of ramen! But any time I try to get cute and make a real healthy meal (I make a mean stir fry!) that just means I get that one and ramen for the rest of the week.

Keto? Heck no. Carbs are literally the cheapest food item on the market. Of course I‚Äôm going to stock my pantry with ramen. Of course I‚Äôm going to make Mac and cheese a staple meal. The same goes for most other diets.

So am I trying to be healthier? Yes. Am I going to lose weight? Probably not. I can exercise til my legs fall off but at the end of the day it‚Äôs still spaghetti for dinner and cereal the next morning (Cheerios. Store brand.)

If you‚Äôre one of those people living on the edge of your paycheck trying desperately to scrape enough out for groceries, I get you. You aren‚Äôt alone. We‚Äôll carb load together. I‚Äôm gonna go eat a bowl of ramen. And I‚Äôm gonna use the seasoning! Judge me, I dare you.

And by the way. Because I average a whole $700 a month income (which is almost EXACTLY enough to cover my major bills) I only get $15 a month in food stamps. So yeah...

Update!!!
Wow um....hello guys. I really didn‚Äôt expect this level of response...from being called a fucking idiot (might be!) to the very informative helpful ones about how to live on my budget (Thank you!). Also just because I mentioned carbs are the cheapest doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not eating meat (thank you to that message who told me to eat som fucking protein!)

So some clarity:

My income before taxes is $800. That means after taxes (sometimes different because of hours.) I make between $650 and $700 a month. I‚Äôm pretty sure our food stamps program is one of the worst (at least I feel like it is.). The most you can get as an individual is just under $200 a month. If you make as much as I do (which is coincidentally the max a person would get on SSI disability) then you either qualify for very little or no food stamps. 

I live in SC in a very small middle of nowhere town. There is ONE food pantry run by many churches and they‚Äôre weirdly strict about who gets food. You do have to qualify for food stamps to get food from them (Don‚Äôt get me started on how stupid that is.) and you have to go on a certain day and time. There are a few other food pantries out of town (30-40 mins away.) and I have gone to them a few times but tend to work during their food five away hours.

As for why I would settle for my income, I am entry level in the field that I want a career in. I am the very bottom level and am working to take the classes and get the certifications I need to climb the ladder (as it were.) I do still perform on the side as a children‚Äôs story teller and that gets me some extra cash around the holidays.

Rent in my area (1 hour radius) is anywhere from $800-$2000 a month. I am fortunate enough to live in a low income apartment that is subsidized by the government. This allows me to live on my own in a small apartment community while I work and try to get the education I need.

I believe I saw one comment about it being Easy, healthy, and cheap. Pick two. I confess I often pick cheap and easy. It‚Äôs not an uncommon choice for sure but I‚Äôm in total agreement that in order to make it cheap and healthy there‚Äôs a ton of time and means involved (both of which are slim at the moment!). I am working on getting to that level. Which is why I appreciate the links to some of the blogs and YouTube channels people have posted.

ALSO I think it‚Äôs worth saying that I in no way think that I‚Äôm doing everything I can to lose weight. I recognize that I should work harder at it, burn more calories, etc. I do not see myself as some pitiful helpless human. I know there‚Äôs more work to do and with my current situation, I am doing my best to make it work.

All in all this was really just meant to be a rant about how much I can‚Äôt stand the videos that portray someone trying to live on my budget. I wish to God I could make a video that was like, I ATE LIKE A SIX FIGURE EARNER FOR A WEEK! HERES WHAT HAPPENED!  XD

I provided the links to repository lists in PA in the post (more specifically a link to a Google doc with the links).¬†


Some other tips I'll add for cheap homes and living:


Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae sells foreclosure. You can view their inventory at¬†homesteps.com¬†and¬†homepath.com. they have houses all over the country. Cheapest one I've seen is¬†$1,000.¬†


Another hack: TrueDream Properties finances parcels of land (mostly out west). I have NOT bought land from them BUT they have a lot of positive reviews.¬†


Typically the land costs $99/month. Some of it is off grid as well.¬†


Once you own the land you can get a cheap camper or RV and stack money to build a home when the land is paid off. I've found decent campers listed for under¬†$1,000¬†where I'm at. This is a great option for individuals or couples especially.¬†


Also: people give away free mobile homes. If you know how to move them cheap and can get a small piece of land cheap, you got yourself a property.¬†


There are trailer courts that will move your trailer for free but you have to pay lot rent.¬†


Every state has some type of tax sale. I am familiar with Pennsylvania.¬†


If you're in a different state, call your tax bureau and ask about their process.¬†

Here's my original post with updates:

So I bought my house and garage for $705.25 in August (my state has repository lists and all properties are $705.25 and mobile homes without land are about $400). I was not allowed inside the property before buying it, and it was ""AS IS,"" but I was able to find out utilities were on within the past year before buying it. The garage is detached.  


The homeowner died in 2016 and the house was unoccupied and packed to the brim with stuff.

Cleaning it out has been overwhelming albeit interesting. The house was so packed that it needed cleaned out just to walk through all of the rooms.

I haven't paid anyone to do work. My income is currently below the poverty line, so this hasn't been just a rut and gut, but a rut and gut on a $250-$300 a month budget.

I thought it'd be fun to share because it was done on a very small budget by only me. Maybe this can help inspire some other folks who, like me, meet the definition of being in poverty or are financially struggling and don't see themselves ever being able to own a home. The point is that, even though I have been working on this since August, progress is coming and I can finally see the light. I project it'll take another 30-60 days.

Now I got SUPER LUCKY with this purchase. I didnt see the inside of the house or garage. The garage was packed with all kinds of tools, most of which worked. There was new gutters, soffit, and siding in the garage rafters. There is a ton of reclaimed wood in the garage and attic.

This saved me a TON of money on materials AND tools. There is likely enough reclaimed wood to re-do most of the house's flooring.

I also was blessed because the hot water tank AND furnace work and the ducting was recently completed by the previous owner. ALL of the appliances worked. There was a washer, dryer, fridge, stove, microwave and beer fridge.

PLUMBING

I was lucky because I had some of the plumbing stuff already. I did a few surveys for Amazon gift cards last summer and scored about $250 in gift cards. Amazon has great deals on fittings.

Example: I paid $43 on Amazon for 10 fittings that would have cost over $100 at Home Depot. Amazon AND eBay also sell generic and brand name Sharkbites a lot cheaper than Home Depot (if you buy 10 packs, they're roughly 50% cheaper than Home Depot).

Home Depot offers a bulk discount if you buy 10 or more CPVC/PVC pipes, meaning I could get 100 feet of 1/2"" and 3/4"" in PVC and CPVC for under $100. If I end up with extra, I can get store credit.

&#x200B;

LUMBER:

Home Depot has a 70% off lumber rack. Sometimes the wood is great, other times it's shit. I cleaned out their discount pile one day. Ended up paying a little under $80 for 8 support beams and a bunch of 2x4s and other lumber that was perfect to re-do the floors. I have enough left over to reframe other areas of the house and add additional support beams in the basement, plus build an exterior door.

TOOLS:

Harbor Freight has been AWESOME. I get 20% and 25% off one item coupons weekly, plus coupons for free items. I split up the purchases to maximize savings, but they typically do that for customers without having to ask. I've ended up getting free tape measures, tarps, rags, and flashlights. Plus they have special coupons for tools (for ex: $20 for a saw) that are better than the 20% off coupon. I did need a reciprocating and circular saw, and got them at 25% off and a free taper measure and tarp.

FLOORING:

I was on [HomeDepot.com](https://HomeDepot.com) and noticed ceramic tile was $0.24/sq foot (retail was $0.82 I think). For whatever reason when I was in the store the same tile was on sale for $0.52/sq foot. I ordered 18 cases for $64 online and got 252 sq ft work of new tile. It was enough to do the kitchen and bathrooms.

ELECTRICAL:

I have 8 fixtures I bought brand new a year ago on [HomeDepot.com](https://HomeDepot.com) for $44 (final clearance).Outlets and single pole light switches are A LOT cheaper on eBay and Amazon than Home Depot.I'm not certain of the extent of the electrical work, but I know a few outlets and switches need replaced and 2 light fixtures need replaced. Electrical wire isn't cheaper online.

&#x200B;

What still needs done:

Some electrical work (unsure of materials, but should be under $150)

Flooring for several rooms (there's over 1,000 sq ft worth of old toungue and groove flooring in the garage and attic. I'm likely going to sand it down and install it, but I may want to do carpet in certain areas).

Porch and front steps need redone.

OSB board still needs put down in the kitchen (still need 2 sheets)

Tile needs installed (Need tile adhesive, grout, and a wet saw. Home Depot rents wet saws for $15/day).

SIDE MONEY/HACKS:I was able to help fund the project by selling items I found in the house. Mostly electronics: DVD players, movies, cameras, etc;. I probably made about $500 selling things from the house over the past few months. I'm planning on keeping the Cedar chest, a lot of the books, the records and record players, the Techniqs home stereo system and furniture.

I have also used survey sites and similar apps to get free Home Depot gift cards and if I get invited to do a focus group or higher paying survey (like one on UserInterviews or Find Focus Groups) I try to put some of that money towards the house.

To save money on disposal, I made a scrap pile and someone took it for free. For items that were in good condition but not worth selling, I donated to Goodwill.

I was able to pickup a free Anderson skylight. Since I have to re-do part of the roof, I can save some time and money by installing a skylight instead of re-doing the entire portion of the roof.

For garbage, I found a farmer who burns and he took a dumpster size load for $150. A dumpster that size is a between $350-$500.

I also take a few bags to the curb where I'm renting once a week and put a few bags out weekly at the house (they take 2 large items a week and up to 2 cans).

I spend a lot of time finding coupons and discounts. Harbor freight is cheapest for tools because of their coupons. Walmart is cheapest for contractor bags. Dollar tree is best for cleaning products. Home depot is cheapest for building materials. All of those stores are within 1 mile so it's convenient to price check in store. Plus there's a Goodwill in the area.

I found respiratores are cheaper online. Thrift stores are great for hand and power tools, fixtures, and odds and ends. I was also able to find coveralls at a thrift store which has a special where everything you fit in bag for $2.

Also have a friend whose husband can hook me up with free siding (manufacturing defects: all pieces are about 1/8th in irregular). It requires a train and 120 mile round trip. It's a nice ace in the hole in case I need to reside.

&#x200B;

I'm a novice at a lot of this stuff, but I'm hoping I found a way to find a cheaper path to home ownership.

UPDATE: I know a lot of people asked and messaged about repository lists in PA. I made a list of most counties (I'm sure I'm missing a few) with links to their repository list/page:

&#x200B;

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTSfvcXJiaXEpgPlSP630HUvF6649pe-iK6JqMbJ0fguFpYabaobpOJNqZV7QED5DGuCm\_vGbgD8sVk/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTSfvcXJiaXEpgPlSP630HUvF6649pe-iK6JqMbJ0fguFpYabaobpOJNqZV7QED5DGuCm_vGbgD8sVk/pub)  


EACH COUNTY has their own rules and process. Allegheny and Philly offer Sherrif's sales. They may have repositories, but I was never able to track those types of properties down in PGH or Philly.   


Minimum bids range from $250-$2,000+. It's completely dependent on the county. Each municipality has the right to reject a bid and set their own minimum price.   


Mobile homes are usually cheaper, but they rarely come with land.   


In terms of parcels: Some are off grid and others aren't buildable.   


Some counties don't have their lists online. HOWEVER, you can call that counties local tax claim bureau and ask for a list (they may charge you for a hard copy).   


When a house reaches the Judicial OR Repository, all liens and taxes are wiped. That includes municipal water and sewer bills. I did have to fight to get the water bill wiped from my house.   


I'll create a new post as well just for PA Repositories. 

UPDATE 2: 

Besides Google and YouTube, I also learned a bit about masonry and Cabinetmaking from two books I picked up at a thrift store. 

Places like Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc are usually filled with these types of How To Books. I have a few others laying around that show how to make basic tables, bookcases, furniture, and small wood projects. 

Also books in thrift stores tend to be super cheap. 

The 2 books I have are pretty old, but still very helpful. Products change (they make hydro Crete cememt now) but the books have a lot of great information, especially on older methods of construction. 

Although the books are older, they're great for work on older homes. Plus they have great instructions on how to do things like lay bricks and build countertops and cabinets! Plus things like stucco and plaster work (which is great because a lot of older home still have plaster).

I have bought any older electrical work books because things have changed a lot for residential wiring (goodbye nob and tube!) But you can build a nice little inventory of home repair books from thrift stores. 

Here's the link to a Masonry book and Cabinetmaking book I have that's had a lot of great information:

 http://imgur.com/gallery/p8CZrbs

Both books are from a series which cover a ton of different topics.

UPDATE 3: Discount materials

The Stock Pile in Canton, Ohio has a ton of awesome stuff, a lot of which is donated by places like Lowe's or taken out of older homes. They offer 10% if you become a member (it's free). 

http://www.thestockpile.org

Some awesome Redditors also shared that Habitat for Humanity has a reStore. I've been to one of their smaller stores, but haven't gone in a while. 

https://www.habitat.org/restores

Other Redditors shared that Construction Junction in Pittsburgh also has awesome finds. They have some of their inventory online as well and some of it is really amazing (old French doors, stained glass)

https://www.cjreuse.org

FREE STUFF:

I've also frequented Craigslist, Facebook marketplace, Letgo and offer up. I check out the free stuff posts as well (great way to find furniture). 

People occasionally will give away old cabinets (many times you have to remove), older appliances, and leftover materials.

THRIFTING:

Thrift stores are great as well. They tend to have tools, fixtures and odds and ends. It's also a really great way to find hand tools and older tools. You can remove rust with Naval Jelly or Vinegar so don't worry if there's some rust!

Goodwill has student, elderly and veteran discounts certain days. In my area they have a massive sale every Sunday and Monday (certain tags are $.39 for everything except clothes. Clothes are $.79). It's a great way to get cheap work clothes.

Some things I've found thrifting for this project:
$5 shop vac, $12 drill bit and spade set, $5 Ryobi drill and charger, $5 for trowels and Mason tools, $1 each for small hand tools, $2 outdoor motion lights and $6 Wolverine steel toed boots.


MONEY BACK TRICKS: 

Ive used Coupon Cabin to order stuff at home Depot. They'll offer specials of 5%-30% cash back via PayPal. Always check your email and you can claim one of their better paying offers every 90 days i believe. 

Discount gift cards: 

This one is tricky because home depot started a policy that merchandise return cards (not gift cards) are non transferable. When you do a return without receipt they register the store credit card to your driver's license. 

People will sell them for up to 50% off face value, but if it's a store credit Merchandise card you might only be able to use it if the original owner buys the stuff for you. 

After the holidays sometimes people will sell gift cards for cash as well. Check Facebook and Craigslist. I know giftcardgranny and raise also have discounted cards and raise gives you a discount when you sign up. 

PayPal occasionally runs specials where they'll give you a gift card for using PayPal as a way method (they did this with subway). 

RECEIPTS:

Keep your receipts and use DEBIT when you can.  You're bound to end up with extra stuff you don't need. If you make your purchases via debit you'll get physical cash when you return items instead of having to wait 3-5 days or take a gift card. Also you want to avoid returns without receipts because a lot of stores put you on a list and may refuse future returns!

Take a picture of the receipt with your phone and always get a copy emailed if the store offers it. 

Trust me I've been in situations where i had maybe $70 worth of stuff i didn't need and couldn't find the receipt. Sometimes it's really a necessity to have that turned back in to cash when you're on a tight budget. 

Also keep them in case a product is defective. The tool manufacturer often will make things right ! I had a Walmart circular saw fry up and hypertough offered me a free replacement. But they needed proof of purchase. So get in the habit of taking pics of your receipts and keeping the paper copies in a safe place.

Plus itll help folks who file taxes. 

TOOL RENTALS:

Vendors typically require a deposit. This means even after you return the item you may not have the funds back for a few days. Each store and bank is different, but keep that in mind so you can plan accordingly. 


DELIVERY:

Luckily i have a small truck, but transporting materials can be an absolute pain if you have a small car. 

Some stores like Menards and home depot do rent trucks (I think it's about $40 for an hour. They don't do this in my area though). 

Also make friends with someone with a large vehicle! I used Facebook to find people who hauled and it was typically $20 for transport. 

Uhaul also rents vans for in town transport. 

Delivery fees can be high. 84 lumber i think costs $50 and home depot $79 for large items. Usually you can find someone with a truck who will do it a lot cheaper. Stores usually will hold your items for a day or two as well. 

SALES:

When youre on a tight budget it's harder to buy materials. What I mean by that is something you will need next week may be on an awesome sale. 

Sometimes you have to jump on a great sale and rearrange the order of your project. Sometimes that is feasible, other times it's not. I chose to buy $64 worth of tile at $0.24/sq ft instead of an exterior door for $75. 

If it's materials you'll definitely use and a really great deal, jump on it and re arrange your projects if you can. 


MATERIALS FROM CONTRACTORS: 

Contractors a lot of times sell stuff they removed during jobs or have leftover supplies. Sometimes they'll even have brand new wire or fittings. They also occasionally have things like hot water heaters and doors. 

HVAC:

Furnaces are ALWAYS cheaper in the summer. Usually you can snag a decent used on (80k BTU) for under $200. 

Water tanks are a lot cheaper used but use your due diligence. Electric ones are usually a lot easier to install and if you get a gas one make sure it can be vented! I ended up buying one last year that i couldn't vent! 

Tankless: make sure you use conversion tables. Theres maps that show what region you're in which matches up with the average water temperature. You CAN absolutely use tankless in cold areas, but make sure you check the specs. 

A/C's: great to pick up in the winter! People will even give them away during the winter. 

MONEY HACKS:

There's a ton of wonderful people on r/beermoney and other subreddits that discuss focus groups, surveys, and other passive streams of income. 

I've used many of the same sites and tactics to get money/gift cards for my project. None have made me rich, but it's helped for sure! 

I've personally used these survery sites:
Branded surveys, iPoll, Qmee, Radial Insights and Pinecone. There's a ton of survey sites and Survey police.com has reviews on most of them. 

Secret shopper apps:
Field Agent, Survey.com, Surveys on the Go, Secret Shopper, iSecret Shop. There's many others but these ones had gigs in my area. 

Focus Groups:
I find them on findfocusgroups. The major sites I've found are User interviews, Validlately, Survey Squad and Schlesinger. I'm sure some folks in beermoney have better lists! 

I've also done UserTesting, TestmyUi and Zoom User. 

I've used these type of sites and apps to help fund my project. The couple extra bucks help. But overall I'm sure some awesome people on r/beermoney have better lists and tips! 

Combining cash back, passive streams of income, coupons and thrifting have saved me a ton of money on this project. 

Last year I decided to give back my financed vehicle and bought a $700 truck. It was a downgrade in a way, but it's been a huge help during this project. It's saved me money with hauling especially. 

TIPS ON MOLD REMOVAL:
http://imgur.com/gallery/0e2mvEo

The kitchen project:

The floor is built on top of a crawl space (which is sloped). The crawl space got wet because a well (which I didnt know was on the property) om the property was overflowing and packed with foilage. 

All the wood in the kitchen floor has to come out (no way to remove mold from dry rotted unfinished wood) abd built back up.

May or may not be a big deal to some (sorry if it has been posted above, I haven‚Äôt read all comments) but consolidating loans will make you take a slight hit to your credit score. 

Mine actually dropped about 20-30 points since I had 5 loans with a 10 year history on each loan, which brought my ‚ÄòAge of Credit History‚Äô from about 7+ years (green) to 3 years (red). 

Obviously for those with lower credit scores that may be quite a significant bump down if you were to lose 20-30 points. Not saying that you will, but it may be worth calculating. 

The way loan consolidation works for credit reporting is simple. The old accounts are closed and a new one is opened (consolidated account). Stinks, but I essentially lost 50 years of ‚Äòaverage age‚Äô in one day when I consolidated (5 loans each with a 10 year history)!

There are a lot of free sites to get full credit reports now. I recommend getting one report from each reporting bureau at least once a year:
- Equifax
- Experian
- TransUnion

Be careful using certain sites, a lot claim to be free but a lot of them also charge or ask for credit cards. By law, everyone is entitled to one free report from each Bureau per year. 
One of my favorite free sites is Annual Credit Report. 
[AnnualCreditReport](https://www.annualcreditreport.com) 

Once you have a report you should be able to see all your accounts listed, see their age, and calculate your Age of Credit History. Then remove those accounts you would be consolidating and add in a new account with age of 1 month and you should be able to get an approximation of your new ‚ÄòAge of Credit History‚Äô. 

For anyone interested in consistently checking their credit scores and details throughout the year on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, I recommend Credit Karma. Great site with a wonderful app as well. 
[Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) 

At Credit Karma this is free viewing of your scores and details whenever you want. You will see two bureaus (TransUnion and Equifax) where you can click onto the details to see the following (with red/yellow/green highlights throughout which is extremely helpful):

1.) Credit Score

2.) Credit Factors 
- Credit card utilization 
- Derogatory marks
- Total Accounts
- Payment History
- Age of Credit History
- Hard Inquiries

3.) Credit changes 

4.) View full credit report (this may be similar to the Annual Credit Report site I listed above, I honestly haven‚Äôt looked into this). 

For most category / subcategory above you can click on the details to see where in the red/yellow/green scale you fall, and what type of impact that particular metric has on your credit score (low/medium/high). It will show the ranges for that particular metric in red/yellow/green so that you can see what would make you jump up or fall down into another category. 

Sorry for the rant, just wanted to provide some details and free info to everyone to help with any decisions related to consolidating loans or just credit scores and oversight into them!

Have a great day redditors! ",2018-08-29 13:50:51

-	There are no true safe places to walk or bike in my area. Drivers do not give a fuck.
-	While my job is casual, I need to maintain a professional appearance. We do not have showers for me to scrub away the stink and sweat from trying to walk/bike across town and back daily.
-	I do not work in a close, tight, NYC style city. Quit assuming that I do, or that I should immediately move to such a place. I live further from the city to save on rent. Also, my job isn‚Äôt even IN the city.
-	MY CITY IS SURROUNDED BY WATER AND WE TRAVERSE IT BY BRIDGES. MOST OF WHICH DO NOT HAVE BIKE LANES. 
-	Too lazy, you say? I walked to all of my college classes no problem. Why? Because they were only a few miles apart. Why am I not walking to work?

394,gxikk9,False,Vent/Rant,309,I was scammed yesterday and I feel devastated.,povertyfinance,"Yesterday afternoon after I got off work, I stopped by a gas station to get something inside.

A young man came up to me and asked if he could use my phone to call his mom. I usually am not one to lend out my phone, but with everything going on in the world I figured I could show some compassion.

So he walked with me inside, at some point he said she wasn‚Äôt answering so he would text her.
I then proceeded to check out at the register while he was ‚Äútexting‚Äù. I asked him if he needed gas money and he said no and then we walked back to my car.

I leave feeling like I did a good deed by helping someone out. 

Well, today I logged into my bank account and saw my account was overdraft by $700. My stomach sank and I looked at where it came from. Turns out, he went onto my cash app and verified through text message. He then proceeded to transfer himself approx. 1300 (most of which I didn‚Äôt have). He then quickly deleted all messages between cash app and exited the apps.

I immediately called my bank and they canceled my debit card just in case and will pursue a dispute once the charge posts.

While I‚Äôm optimistic that the funds will be restored, I just really feel like crap. I had just crawled out of years long debt and was finally starting to slowly save and then Boom! Life is thrown at you. It just feels terrible to work so hard and then get it all stolen by a man abusing kindness. I also attempted to file a police report but the officer called me, I told my story, and then he said he‚Äôll call me back to get more info. He never called back. I wanted to file the police report to make the county aware of this scam that could affect others and to bolster my fraud claim.

I‚Äôm sorry for the rant. If I‚Äôve learned anything it‚Äôs too not be too trusting of strangers, which unfortunately I will have to take to heart from now on.



Update 1: The charge posted yesterday evening and my bank automatically submitted the fraud claim. I logged into my bank and account and I was issued a provisional credit. If the transaction is deemed to be legit or the merchant (cash app) issues a credit, the credit into my account will be reversed.

As far as a police report, I‚Äôm going to physically go to the police station to file a report today. I‚Äôm also going to see if the gas station has surveillance they would be willing to hand over, I imagine that may be a legality issue but I‚Äôll try it.

Thank you all for your words of kindness and advice. I honestly appreciate it. A lot of good advice has been given and other scams revealed, so what was intended to be just getting my feelings out hopefully has opened the eyes of others, as myself, in the scams that are lurking. 

A lot of people have mentioned to not let this ruin my kindness, and they are right. I will continue to help others when possible; but I will be vigilant and prepared if they have nefarious intentions from now on.

It‚Äôs merely a lowly account of how I beat the cycle of poverty. I will mention parts of my personal 30+ year journey as illustrative examples. I‚Äôm a very pragmatic person, so I like organizing my points into actionable deliverables and providing practical tips.

I‚Äôve noted common vs. uncommon advice so that it helps you skim / skip. Even for the common advice, it might be worth the read because I‚Äôve attempted to narrow it down to the most useful / impactful ones that worked for me.

&#x200B;

1. **\[Common\] Your greatest asset is your health, don‚Äôt overlook it.** I know some of us had to work multiple jobs, myself included.. but I learned this the hard way. Your health should always come first. Without it, you can‚Äôt work and you can lose everything.
   1. **Active prevention** \- Eat right, exercise and get an annual physical (if you‚Äôre able). You don‚Äôt have to pay for a gym - walk 30 minutes a day around your neighborhood at a minimum! A cheap alternative to the gym is the city community center ($30 for the **entire year** in my high cost of living city vs. $30 **a month** at a commercial gym).
   2. **Don‚Äôt overwork** \- Each person has his or her own limit, but‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take on too much. You can suffer from exhaustion and die from it.
   3. **Keep your mental health in check** \- Talk about your struggles with loved ones, and seek outside help from counselors, a religious leader or even Reddit! Mental health is so important and without it, we can make bad decisions that have irreversible consequences.
2. **\[Uncommon\]** **Sacrifice** \- Unfortunately, living in poverty taught me that it is filled with heavy sacrifices.
   1. **Some social events** \-  I was never able to attend school dances. Why? They cost money and I was barely able to afford clothes. I wore a rotation of 2-3 school outfits the whole school year.  I spent my early twenties busting my @ss off at work to get out of the projects. There was nothing like drive bys during holidays to motivate me to work harder. People who love you, will make time for you, and vice versa. To some, social events are very important. Although it was painful at the time, I don‚Äôt have any regrets. 
   2. **Material necessities** \- Having a car is a necessity in my area‚Ä¶ and I had to take several hours of bus rides when it could have taken 20-30 minutes by car. As a woman, I was not able to afford beauty products when I was poor. It was tough, but at least there were workarounds...
   3. **Time, effort and sleep** \- Greatest things you‚Äôll have to sacrifice when you don‚Äôt have money‚Ä¶
   4. **Dignity** \- Working at the bottom could be one of the most dehumanizing experiences one can face. People use you and treat you like shit. They talk over you, yell at you, tell you you‚Äôre not worth it in some form, etc. How I overcame this was by becoming more emboldened and standing up for myself. **DOCUMENT evidence**, my friends. BE VERY SPECIFIC with dates, times, places, quotes, etc. and email it to yourself, should you ever need to use it. Unfortunately, some people just don‚Äôt have class, so when they resort to **personal attacks**, I shut it down **immediately** by simply stating that it is below my level of professionalism when someone is unable to stick to the work product. I‚Äôm used to having experts nitpicking and tearing apart my analyses‚Ä¶ and one of the hardest lessons to learn early in my career was not taking these critiques personally. I used to be afraid to speak up to abusive bosses for fear of losing my job‚Ä¶ but I armed myself with knowledge and experience to combat this. So I learned how to argue, come up with counterpoints, poke holes in their logic and reasoning, but most of all - control my emotions and being professional even when others are unprofessional. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve had awesome bosses as well, but early in my career, I‚Äôve had to deal with an inordinate amount of bad ones. Growing up, bullying was common for being poor. I was made fun of for a lot of different reasons, but it taught me to be resilient and enabled me to improve myself.
3. **\[Common\]** **Make friends and network**
   1. I‚Äôd say about 33% of the people at a previous firm were hired through friends and/or family. They had a guaranteed interview at a minimum vs. someone submitting a resume had like a 1/100 shot at an interview.
   2. One coworker I had was incredible. She would befriend almost every client we had and was so genuine‚Ä¶ She had a personal touch with each person. You better believe she was one of the most amazing people I‚Äôve had the privilege to work with and to learn from.
   3. Networking and making friends allows you to have more job opportunities and tap into a pool of resources. Different people are good at different things. They can help you out in life and vice versa.
4. **\[Common\]** Capitalize on your strengths, minimize your weaknesses and develop yourself.
   1. **Know what your strengths are and cultivate them.** I used to be painfully shy and had trouble speaking to everyone. However, I had to change this in order to get good grades, be gainfully employed and move up the ladder. **Communication skills** are absolutely necessary in order to get ahead in life. The ability to be persuasive and convincing with your viewpoints, the ability to distill complex information in an understandable manner, utilizing humor to lighten intense situations and being able to give valuable input and solutions - all of this is rolled up under communication skills.
   2. **Minimize your weaknesses.** We all have weaknesses, and you need to find out ways to mitigate them. Some people are predatory and will try to use them against you, or we can just fall short at times. It‚Äôs good to admit we have them and try our best to improve.
5. **\[Uncommon\] Try to be nice to everyone, even the @ssholes.**
   1. Don‚Äôt burn your bridges, if possible. It‚Äôs a small world out there. You will most likely run into people again at some point especially if you work within a certain field. Even if someone did you dirty, keep it professional and move on. I don‚Äôt waste my energy trying to get revenge, or telling them off, or whatever‚Ä¶ things have a way of evening themselves out.
   2. Sometimes, you have to work with @ssholes. Be nice to them, or at the very least, deliver the message without negative emotions. You never know when the jerk will actually help you.
6. **\[Uncommon\] Opportunities**
   1. **Learn how to identify opportunities, prioritize them and take action on the right ones.** First, it might be easy to identify opportunities if you‚Äôve grown up without many. However, there is an art to knowing which ones to take or leave behind. What I mean is that some opportunities are indirect or too speculative. Some are tempting but are too risky‚Ä¶ In the end, it depends on what you want and what you value. For example, it might be tempting to take the higher paying job offer that has little upward mobility because you have an immediate need for money, but in the long run, career development and advancement becomes increasingly important.
   2. **Create opportunities.** You can create opportunities especially nowadays. I created my own jobs by learning some musical instruments and providing lessons that paid me twice the minimum wage at the time (which was still much less expensive than what professional musicians charged), and the occasional gig at $100 an hour. For the record, I disclosed to everyone that I wasn‚Äôt a professional musician.
   3. **Opportunity cost.** Evaluate your opportunity costs. Although you might have no choice but to be the fixer of your car / water leak / random plumbing issue / etc., be an assembly person, cook, etc. if you‚Äôre able to afford it, it might be worth it to hire a professional to save you the trouble. I calculate how much I make an hour and multiple that to the estimated time it will take me to fix it, and then make my decision. Some opportunity costs aren‚Äôt quantifiable by money, but might require sacrifices made on life events. I remember not telling my mom about the parent conferences or mommy and me events at school, because I knew she had to work.
7. **\[Common\] Take advantage of the resources available to you**
   1. There‚Äôs no shame in asking for help, but be proactive as much as possible. Take initiative, and take advantage of the resources available to you. It goes both ways. One day, when you‚Äôre out of poverty, you‚Äôll remember the help you got and hopefully help others! No one can do it alone.
8. **\[Uncommon\] Your greatest business partner is your significant other.** Think of it this way - Who gets half (theoretically) in the case of a divorce? Cut people out that are toxic and get closer to the ones that make you better.
   1. Haters - There will be haters and naysayers around you. Don‚Äôt let the hate get you down.
   2. Try to surround yourself with people that make you better, not worse.
   3. One of the biggest decisions in your life is settling down with ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù It has a great impact on your financial life. Sometimes, you can get out of poverty from marrying someone well off; other times, you can get into the trappings of poverty from marrying someone who makes bad financial and personal decisions. All I can say is, do whatever you can to be self-sustainable because the divorce rate is 50%, people‚Äôs health fail, shit happens, and in the end, it‚Äôs up to you to decide how you want to live your life.
9. **\[Common\] Know your audience and learn how to pitch yourself**
   1. You need to know your audience and adapt to their preferences. This means that you may have to study up on the common trends, specific vernacular and small talk in your desired career field.
   2. Learn how to pitch yourself, not only for interviews but to advance yourself in your career.
10. **\[Common\] Strike a balance**
11. Try to strike a balance in all that you do. For major decisions, sleep on it and get other people‚Äôs viewpoints - especially opposing viewpoints. Don‚Äôt surround yourself with yes people because this will hurt you in the long run.
12. **\[Common\] Grow your money / earnings potential.**
13. **Education** \- Learn the necessary skills to earn a decent paying job. Whether it be college, trade school, certificates, apprenticeships, etc., gain the knowledge in order to get the experience, which leads to more $$$. There are many threads on this, so I won‚Äôt go into further detail. It‚Äôs worth noting that I tried to get accreditations and degrees on paper from well-established institutions so it minimizes any credibility issues.
14. **Experience** \- Even if it‚Äôs an internship, you need to get your foot in the door by getting real experience. I recall many ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù positions requiring some experience‚Ä¶
15. **Branch out into related fields** \- Jobs are becoming highly specialized. Try not to pigeonhole yourself into one niche and be adaptive to the needs of the job market.
16. **Investing** \- Take advantage of any matching offered by your company, learn how to invest your money even if you don‚Äôt have it yet. I believe in value investing and investing in companies that have differentiation, a clear path towards revenue, and actually making revenue. I try to stay away from companies that are losing money even if they are well known (even if it‚Äôs in a growth stage) - different thoughts on this though and it‚Äôs largely personal preference. Diversify your wealth so that you don‚Äôt lose it all at once.
17. **Depends on your area, but try to save up to buy a home** \- Rent money goes out the window vs. you‚Äôre able to build equity when purchasing a home plus tax benefits. Lots of advice on this elsewhere.
18. **\[Common\] Learn how to manage your money and track it regularly.** This goes hand in hand with building wealth. What good is it to make a lot of money when you don‚Äôt know how to keep it?
19. **\[Uncommon benchmark\]** Differentiate necessities, nice to haves, and wants / splurges. Denote the frequency of use. Analyze how much of your spending habits fall within each bucket. When I was living in poverty, 99%+ of the money spent was on necessities. It was rare that I would get a Christmas present, and I remember thinking as a young child that it meant I was a bad child. I cried myself to sleep and then cheered myself up when I came to the conclusion that Santa couldn‚Äôt give me a present because my apartment didn‚Äôt have a chimney. (I lived in the suburbs, so we didn‚Äôt have toys for tots programs nearby.)
20. **Track your spending habits.** This will make you aware of how much you‚Äôre actually spending / wasting / saving. It allows you to make corrections expediently and makes you accountable.
21. **\[Common\]  Save, save, save.**
22. **Saving money** is the first step to getting out of poverty. If you have a 90%+ rate of spending behavior vested in necessities, then it means that you are getting the required discipline to save. Analyze how many unexpected financial events happened in the past year, and then adjust your savings rate % accordingly, or better yet, use a 5 year average.
23. **Biggest savings behaviors** \- Cooking at home, ability to fix things, being good at administrative stuff / filling out paperwork pay off, big time.
24. **Savings from coupons.** Whether it be online, or the ads you get in snail mail, utilize coupons whenever possible!
25. **Frugality**.  Whole subreddit dedicated to this. It‚Äôs worth noting that I‚Äôm all for saving the environment and saving money and stuff‚Ä¶ but I draw the line with reusable toilet paper.

&#x200B;

**Mindset-oriented**

1. **Don‚Äôt get trapped in the victim mindset**

I got trapped in the victim mindset in being dealt a bad deck of cards. I didn‚Äôt have much handed to me growing up, and I definitely had a lot of resentment and bitterness for suffering for things I didn‚Äôt cause myself. This resulted in a depressive ‚ÄúOh woe is me!‚Äù cycle in which I spent a lot of time crying, complaining, being hopeless, etc. Then one day, I realized that I was wasting time because instead of doing something useful, I was spending my time being miserable. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. Emotions get the best of us and can‚Äôt be controlled at times‚Ä¶ but deadlines are unforgiving, and I had to make ends meet. So I realized that although I cannot control what happens to me, I can try to control how I react to them‚Ä¶ which brings me to the next points.

**2. Turn negatives into positives**

This took a lot of trial and error, but I had to learn how to turn negatives into positives. Stuck with team members that slacked off? I wasn‚Äôt happy with them, but I saw it as a leadership opportunity and carried the team. Not enough money to buy breakfast? It‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt have to work out as much. Made fun of for wearing the same clothes? It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm going to channel all the anger I have and study/work more. Success is the best revenge.

3. **It‚Äôs okay to fail.** **Just pick yourself back up and try again.** Try as many times as you need to. Try something different. The key is to not be discouraged or paralyzed from the fear of failing. I didn‚Äôt have much to lose, so it explains why I kept at it. Have a back up plan, and another backup for the backup.

4. **Get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself.** You‚Äôll need to get out there and make things happen, because no one is going to do it for you! Get used to doing things you don‚Äôt like. I had to leave my ego at the door and have a receptive, learning attitude.

5. **Enjoy the pleasantries but also recognize the faults.** Sometimes, we think in black and white. If you like someone, you can ignore his or her faults, and vice versa. I think it‚Äôs important to have a well-rounded, realistic view of everything and everyone, including ourselves.

6. **It‚Äôs easy to say you ‚Äúknow‚Äù or say you will do something, but hard to actually do it.** There‚Äôs a lot of times when I hear people refuse advice because ‚Äúthey already know‚Äù or they say they‚Äôre going to do it‚Ä¶ but very few times when I actually see people applying or practicing the lessons. It‚Äôs not just about knowing, it‚Äôs about doing.

&#x200B;

**Things I learned while being poor:**

* Jack of all trades - Because you don‚Äôt have a lot of resources available, you end up doing a lot of random things.
* I‚Äôve seen people go either way - Either they become GREAT problem-solvers, or really bad at it. You usually have to go through a milieu of different kinds of bullshit, usually simultaneously, so you get good at coming up with solutions on the fly and putting out fires.
* Learned early in life that my best was not enough. It was utterly devastating. I had to learn my shortcomings and limitations, and saw inequities abound.
* I try not to take things for granted. I thank people for helping me and for whatever contribution they bring - big and small.
* I learned not to be as judgmental. Living a tough life, I know I could have messed up and have made mistakes. When someone makes a bad or unhealthy decision, who am I to judge? It could have been me!
* I was ugly, awkward and poor, of which the most painful was being poor. Being poor means that no matter how smart, capable, etc. you are, you still might get passed up because you didn‚Äôt have certain connections or opportunities presented to you. It‚Äôs a powerless position in which you see the worst in people, and in rare times, the best in people.
* No one wants to hang around someone who is sad / complaining / etc. Although it‚Äôs hard at times, I try to be upbeat and positive. I don‚Äôt want to worry others or burden them with my problems - each person has enough of his/her own struggles.
* **It‚Äôs expensive to be poor.** You get hit with bank monthly minimums, higher interest rates, etc.
* **Social injustices are real and rampant.** This is another thread in itself.
* **Keep your eye on the prize** \- Don‚Äôt lose focus. A lot of small steps and small wins are necessary for the big win. It‚Äôs okay to have setbacks and make mistakes - just‚Ä¶ keep‚Ä¶ going.

&#x200B;

**What gave me an edge:**

* **Good reader of people.** This allowed me to avoid toxic people and gauge situations effectively.
* **Anticipate people‚Äôs needs.** This gave me an advantage because people really appreciate when you‚Äôre able to deliver what they want/need without them having to tell you.
* Struggling AF during junior high and high school competing against kids that had so many resources. I had to put in 2-3 times the effort. I continued this work ethic and this allowed me to get multiple degrees and certifications while working.
* Ability to quickly pick things up, including thinking on the fly. People don‚Äôt really hold your hand in the real world. While I had many good teachers, I had to self study a lot of things in the workplace. Most of all, I had to learn how to react and adapt quickly to sensitive and tenuous situations.
* An open mind to learn new things, flexibility and adaptability, being forgiving, giving without expectations or quid pro quo, motivation to do better and be better, and belief in God.

&#x200B;

**Things I learned NOT to do:**

* Try not to get into unhealthy addictive behaviors. It‚Äôs difficult to get out of, and it usually perpetuates the cycle of poverty.
* Don‚Äôt blame others for everything. Try to be accountable to yourself, and own it. Of course others are to blame sometimes, but playing the blame game doesn‚Äôt really solve the problem.
* Try not to become disillusioned, and don‚Äôt lose hope. It took me 20+ years to get out of poverty. It might take some others less time, and some others more. However, the key is to keep trying and know that at the end of the day, love heals the pain and covers a multitude of suffering.
* Don‚Äôt be cruel to others, even if you think they deserve it. When we get into a cycle of vengeance, you often become destroyed in the process of trying to destroy others.
* Don‚Äôt rely on others to break the cycle of poverty for you. If you get a lucky break, then great! However, the reality is that for many people, we have to break the cycle ourselves.

431,e5mgxm,False,None,162,Just want to remind everyone that how much you spend on xmas gifts will not change anyone's opinion of you,povertyfinance,"At least those people whose opinions you value.

Vaguely coherent gift rant: My sister just sent me a gift idea for my grandma. It's a personalized fingerprint necklace. But the thing costs $110... Far beyond my budget. But it started me thinking about my Grandma, and gift giving.

 I think this goes for any Grandma, but she has lived a long time already, and I think she's experienced all that the material world can give her. But yet I feel like most people spend a lot of money on gifts for their grandma. I'm just spit-balling, but I am guessing grandmas don't *really* care about getting new stuff. They enjoy the time spent, the photos, the memories etc. 

Even for my parents, I feel like a weird obligation to spend more money on their gifts than say, my sister's gift. But after thinking about it a bit, it makes no sense. There is nothing they could want that they can't get already, so why should I over-extend myself to give them a gift that I deem 'expensive enough'. So don't try to live up to this fictitious expectation that you've set in your head as an acceptable amount to spend on someone's gift.

Drink water at home too. Prices aren't nearly as bad for a soft drink or glass of wine when you buy for home, but they are still a lot more than water.  Invest in a filter of some type. I'm using a brita pitcher until I can install a filtration system. Shoot, depending on where you live you might be totally fine with tap water.

Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes! You guys are awesome! 

A little more background information! 

I tried the best I could to not incur school debt, but I was a first generation high school graduate and definitely had no idea what I was doing. In the end, I borrowed ~$30,000 for school loans, which in the grand scheme of things wasn't much, but I'm glad to be out from under it. 

I took the semester off between high school and starting at community college. I worked 84 hours a week and saved up a tidy sum to help me through the first semester. I had a pretty decent scholarship/grant package that paid my tuition for my first 2 years of community college. I worked part-time in my field to gain experience. I transferred to a Big 10 School, and received a similar financial aid deal for tuition, working full time in the summer. 

I used student loans to buffer my paltry paychecks, allowing me to live in an off-campus apartment, by myself, and save my sanity. I also used some money to travel, and to attend lots of work shops related to my field. I worked an AmeriCorps stint after graduation that paid a lump sum toward my loans, but the rest has been diligently plugging away at them.

444,ekfxp2,False,None,82,I asked for a raise for the first time ever,povertyfinance,"And I got it! 

I wrote out a formal letter bulleting my successes over the past four years, named my figure and the reasons I was asking for that specific figure, attached my research, and had a meeting with my manager to go over everything. I didn‚Äôt feel like it went well. My manager didn‚Äôt seem interested in discussing anything with me. She took the letter from me and that was that. I left feeling pretty discouraged. 

The thing is, I was making 11% below the average for my job title in our area, but I frequently take on the responsibilities of other job titles. So I asked for a 15% raise. I absolutely did not think they would give me that much, but I had hoped that it would leave room for some negotiation. I really wanted that 11%. If they were unwilling to negotiate, I decided I‚Äôd have to find a new job after my leave (see below - currently pregnant). I know I am worth more than I was making. 

It took two weeks to hear back. Unfortunately, it was really bad timing. I wanted to ask for a raise a while ago, but my company has been undergoing some awkward changes for about seven months. It NEVER seemed like a good time to take my chances, until I realized there wouldn‚Äôt be a good time for a while and I was running out of time. I am pregnant, going on STD soon, and figured it was now or never. I needed the extra cash. When my manager finally called me in, she told me how much they all appreciate my efforts and how nothing I‚Äôve done has gone unnoticed. She offered me the 11% I was secretly hoping for, and I took it! 

I still can‚Äôt believe it! I‚Äôm not an executive or anything like that. I‚Äôm a glorified receptionist in the eyes of most, so it took a lot of confidence building for me to decide that I deserved this raise and I deserved the opportunity to ask for it, even though I had no idea if how I was going about it was right or wrong. This will definitely help soften the blow of a new baby for my husband and I while we pay off thousands in medical debt (not including what‚Äôs to come after the birth).

I had great dental care in Mexico for a third of what it would cost here. Lots of people I know have as well. They also did not try to upsell me on unnecessary treatments that would have compromised the health of my teeth. I was told I needed SIX root canals in the US by an arrogant ass who said people who went to mexico were idiots. A 3D xray in mexico and proper evaluation led to NO root canals and no crowns. I had a great experience and my teeth are great now. Do your homework when traveling for dental or medical help, we have the internet now. (Also, Tijuana has killer gourmet mexican restaurants for the price of chipotle.)

American dentists and doctors will always fill you with horror stories because it's their competition, but you can get really shitty, incompetent work in the US. Our health ""care"" system is completely extortionist, don't be their pawn. In fact, medical care is the third leading  cause of death in the US now, and that's for people who can even get in -- many  don't even bother with getting care anymore because of how inaccessible it is. I don't, my deductible is crippling. I have mentally prepared that an acute injury or illness is likely going to be my death unless I can get to some place like mexico or thailand.

What are some clever ways of getting these properties into the hands of people who need them - for cheap?",povertyfinance,"First let me say that I'm not talking about crazy schemes, or the long term and risky process of claiming squatters rights here.

I'm looking for realistic ways to get unused housing into the hands of the people who need it. 

I'm coming from a background where I struggled for 14 years to get my own home. After the 2008 recession my country (Ireland) was hit hard, and as a self employed person I could no longer get a mortgage despite having good credit and savings. This severely limited my budget and options. In the end only by pure luck did I manage to track down the owner of an abandoned and derelict house (through Facebook) and managed to buy it for half the price of the next cheapest property in my area.

One year later, and a having expended a huge amount of time and effort, the property is mostly restored and my young family finally has their own home. Everyone in the community is happy because their village has had an eyesore removed, and it feels like I've had a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I finally have some stability in my life that renting could never offer.

But I know I was incredibly lucky, and many in the same situation will not find a similar opportunity.

So what can be done? Are there any registers of abandoned properties in your area. Any ways to find out who owns them and get in contact? Scheme's or grants for restoring buildings that are derelict or eyesores in the community?

I'd love to see resources made available to the people who need housing - connecting them with properties that need love, but that may also be more affordable because of this.

So this is the update to my endeavor and before I continue the story, I want to preface this with: **I AM NOT POSTING FOR PITY.** I know there was quite a few people who were intrigued and invested in my experiment, and I wanted to give an update to what happened.

Basically, the task was for me to try and save whatever clinky change I had and money I would have spent on lotto tickets and essentially, the task failed successfully.

The bucket ended up actually helping me out in the end because late July 2019, my mother had a fall and broke both ankles.

Needless to say, it kicked off two of the hardest, stressful, and needlessly painful months of my life.

She would spent a month in hospital, spent time and rehab, home, back to the hospital all the while my family my family fighting with Medicare, transportation services, and equipment renters and failing to be able to provide a basic level of care in her condition.

This would be the straw to break the camels back and she would ultimately decide to quit dialysis and come home on hospice where within 3 days she would be gone.

So what does any of this have to do with me managing my money? I‚Äôll tell yah.

My bucket came in handy because suddenly I was driving from work, to hospitals and a rehab center which mean a lot of gas, and a fuckton of tolls.

What little I had initially saved helped, and it became more like a contingency savings account because as anyone who‚Äôs paid biweekly knows- getting paid twice a month FUCKING BLOWS.

So it helped insure that when all my bills were paid, I would have gas and toll money and even some to bring my mom lunch or dinner.

So where do I stand now? The bucket is empty save for some pennies. Basically, the experiment has ceased being of my utmost concern because even now nearly 4 months later, I‚Äôm still wading my way out of the grieving process and have been throwing any money I do have extra towards student loans, paying off my credit card, my car payment, and a new mattress.

But since this is a story I guess I should give it some moralistic ended and I think it would be: expect the unexpected, and don‚Äôt be afraid to change your plans. Sometimes accidents is how we obtain results.

Will I try it again? Probably not for a while, but if I do, I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/ep6g04/remember_the_guy_last_year_who_had_a_3gallon/,2370,Best to pay off your debts first. Good luck! ,2020-01-15 18:48:45

On Sunday, I went to Aldi and bought $100 worth of groceries to hopefully last me for 2 weeks. 

Sunday night, I made a take and bake pizza from Aldi (I didn't really like it. The crust was kind of doughy and the sauce was too sweet for my liking but considering my roommate caught our oven on fire last week, the doughy crust might be a result of that.)

Monday, I just ate leftover pizza before one of my final exams. Even though I didn't like it, I didn't want to waste food.

Tuesday, I made a simple oven bake Campbell's skillet meal type thing. It was literally two chicken breasts, one potato cut in half and I poured the sauce over it. Baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 50 minutes and it was delicious. It was perfect considering I had 2 final exams on Tuesday. 

Wednesday, I had my last final exam. I utilized my crock pot and made a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. Cooked on high for 6 hours. 

Thursday, had leftover pot roast. Was even better the day after.

And Friday, I made cheesy chicken and rice. Utilized the crock pot again. I have enough leftovers to last me the entire weekend.

Within a month I was certified with all the bells and whistles they required (proper ID, background check,  fingerprinting, educational course) and got trained. They liked me and kept me on, they were short handed at the time so I was able to prove myself over those first few weeks just working weekends while trying to figure out how to keep working at the job I had.   It was pet retail with a revolving door of terrible managers, and closing in on the holidays, so they wanted to push me around and say I wouldn‚Äôt get hours if I wasn‚Äôt available for the days I needed off for the new job.  I pretty much called their bluff, and they gave me crappy hours to just be on register.  I had been working for the company for years was certified to work with the animals themself (cleaning cages to giving medicine) but they constantly put me as cashier because I was more efficient and my customer service, I‚Äôll brag, is above par.  So I just waited, biding my time until I got the full time offer at the new job, and then gave my two weeks. They were floored, panicked even? When the two weeks were almost up, my store manager told me the team didn‚Äôt want me to leave and asked if I was interested in picking up hours when I could. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know‚Äù I said as earnestly as I could, catching a little bit of feels despite myself at my team speaking up for me.

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of folks criticizing and quick to pass judgments not based on any facts. This post was intended to encourage and inspire people who might have been in a tight spot like I was. Prior to now, I‚Äôve never had any sort of savings and have been living off purely on my regular U.I benefits. Being on a fixed income calls for drastic lifestyle changes that I had to make in order for me to support myself on the little that was coming in. So to you all that are saying I don‚Äôt belong in poverty finance, y‚Äôall need to think twice. I was living within my means prior to the CARES Act so as you would imagine when those extra $600 payments started kicking in, I didn‚Äôt quite need it because I was already fine living off my existing regular benefits. So I did what was best and decided to save it all. And just because I saved everything and now have $5k doesn‚Äôt mean I have it all nor am I better than the next person living in poverty. What differentiates us is that I made the wise decision to save. It don‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm swimming in riches or anything cos had it not been for this CARES Act I wouldn‚Äôt have had a dime in savings. So please please and please the madness needs to stop. If you‚Äôre angry that someone saved up $5k whereas you can‚Äôt then you should reevaluate yourself. I‚Äôm sure everyone here who is unemployed is receiving the same $600 payments I‚Äôve been getting that led up to this savings. What‚Äôs important is how you manage ur living situation and what you do with your finances. Don‚Äôt be all up in your feelings and dragging people down with all that negativity!!!

I graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1997.  I can not precisely tell you what my loan balance was (cautionary tale, remember?) but it was probably around $30,000.  Yep. You read that right.  $30,000 and it took me 22 years to get it dealt with.

Over those years, I defaulted twice.  Had wages garnished twice.  Went into a repayment program after the first default and was doing pretty darn well until 2016.  Had a bunch of personal stuff happen, and ended up in default again.  I didn't open my mail. I dodged every phone call from them.  I just couldn't face the idea of talking to them.  I got really lucky and got a bonus at work.  They garnished part of that, and it was enough to finally pay off the loans.  I'm free.

I do have a tiny bit of advice learned from the school of hard knocks:

When bill collectors call you, they can be jerks.  However, if YOU call THEM, it's a different story - at least when it comes to student loans.  Sit down today and call them if you are in arrears.  Talk to them and don't bury your head in the sand.  They can do things to help you avoid defaulting - or help you sort it out if you have defaulted.  I know it's no fun. I know it's mortifying.

But before doing that I'll just preface this by stating: I'm not saying there is anything wrong with trucking or skilled trade work.

The issue with this topic is the hysterically large sums of money that people seem to infer is ""normal"" for these types of jobs.

The **median annual wage** for  *heavy truck drivers* is $20.42/hour or $42k/year, for *electricians* it is $26.01/hour or $54k/year, and for *plumbers* $25.28/hour or $53k/year. Are those all good wages? In most of the country, yes. Will they get you out of poverty? Yes. But remember, those are **medians,** which means you could very likely make less than that.

Almost no one in the trades or driving trucks is making these large salary numbers that get tossed around here. I have no doubt the people posting are getting paid what they say in most cases - but they are the exception. It seems people are forgetting if you work enough hours in any job, you'll make a lot of money. Truckers making $90k a year aren't normally being paid that much on a per hour basis, they are just working 60 hour weeks most of the year. Work any job that allows that kind of overtime and you'll make good money. And of course there are cases of people in trades making $90k a year with little overtime. They tend to be *in unions* in *very high cost of living areas* (and their wages won't apply to 99% of people in the occupation). 

Finally, most of these jobs are **not** in some sort of ""shortage."" Trucker jobs, for example, are expected to grow about as fast as all occupations (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Certain regions may have a temporary shortage, but it isn't national and it won't last long enough to drive up wages. Jobs involving trucking and trades are actually very cyclical. During an economic downturn, these jobs get hit worse than other occupations because they rely on commerce or construction activity.

I make six figures when I'm over the road (I'm not a trucker) and  $80k when I stay local and am home every night.

Dollar Tree is our go-to place for a lot of necessities and sometimes even food. We've purchased bread, cereal, pasta, 24oz cans of sauce, juice, gallons of drinking water, and hygiene items there in the past. We're not big on name brands for most things so long as what we buy serves it's purpose. We were down to our last five dollars and we're low on food in the house. The little ones immediately lit up at the toys and games, wanting one thing each. Normally, I'd hoard coins and when I had 2 bucks, I'd reserve that for those Dollar Tree trips so we don't buy anything we don't need out of our regular pool of funds. Even when you're making a decent amount, you budget for frivolous items. My husband gently explained to them that we couldn't get them anything this time. We already had to buy toilet paper and were down to just apple juice, a pound of ground beef, and white rice at home and I forgot the coin bag. They had a melt-down that usually comes with being overtired. They cried all the way back to the toy aisle to put their toys  back and cried all the way to the register. A lady felt bad and told them to pick their toys and she'd pay for them because seeing them cry broke her heart. I had to hide down an aisle to cry, myself. I made sure the babies said their thank yous and we did the walk of shame back to our car. 

Next time, either my husband or myself will go to the store to get *needs*. I'll leave them at home so they can rest, so they can play, so they can be occupied. So I don't have to feel defeated all the way home for not being able to get them *wants*.

531,9n9mcm,False,None,298,How to stop paying for everyone and protect my money? People leech off of me.,povertyfinance,"As I am eating my very pro-budget but not very pro-health lunch of wraps with only canned beans and chilli sauce, I had a realisation while reflecting on why I don't have money to eat properly. It is very stupid, but it explains why I still am struggling financially. To put it short: my family has always been very poor. My parents are doing okay now financially, but they still raised us in that culture, by lack of a better word . Because of this, I grew up with a few (unspoken) social rules:

* One: you never judge someone for not having money. You sympathise. When someone says they don't have money, you help them with the little bit you have.
* Two: everything that is not food and bills that immediately need to be paid is 'extra' money that you can use to help family and friends.
* Three: always offer to pay when the other does not respond (while being out for coffee, drinks or dinner groceries).

This has resulted in me paying for a significant amount of food for a handful of friends, that kept triggering me with storied about how they could not eat that week. I paid for sandwiches when their cards declined, I always paid when doing groceries etc.

Normally, I give people the benefit of the doubt. But last week or so I received a rude wake-up call. A friend agreed to help me with an important assignment that I had been struggling with all week. Before we even got started, he said:

'we are going to eat together tonight, right?' I was pretty sure that we had never agreed to that, so I said

'Oh I'm sorry, I can't remember I had promised that. I would rather work on this assignment which will take me the entire afternoon and probably tonight as well.'

**He then said this:** 'Oh that's okay! I can do the grocery shopping for us! Wait, I don't have money... oh well, I can skip dinner tonight!'

then he paused. And I felt so bad that I ordered pizza. Which cost me 25 euros. Which I could not afford at all. But I also had to finish the assignment and did not want to deal with the added stress of him guiltripping me the entire time he was helping me. Because I did need his help.

&#x200B;

Later, I found out that the week before he had spend over 50 euros on shots. He also eats pizza and subway almost every day for dinner. The worst is: he puts aside 10% of his salary on a savings account, while I plunder mine to deal with unexpected expenses like him needing to eat.

&#x200B;

The difference is this:

\- He says he doesn't have money because he put aside 100 euros on his savings account and spends a shitload of money on booze. There are a number of occasions with other people that I suspected this was the case but gave people the benefit of the doubt.

\- I say I don't have money because I literally have no money left in my bank account. Which has not yet happened, luckily. I don't eat out ever, I don't order food, I freeze big bags of vegetables and potatoes so I can get by from only 10 euros of groceries a week.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I only found out his financial situation by talking to another friend, who had gone partying with him and knows him better, so she could tell me all that. By then the damage has already been done. Because I know this now, I will not do it again with him. But most often, I do not know the context and I assume they had a good reason to be, well, poor.

&#x200B;

I visited my sister two weeks ago, and it was basically a fight of who got to pay for the coffee.  We're both poor, working students so we knew the other would appreciate the gesture! This is what I am used to. But this is not what I am experiencing at all in the student city that I am a part of.

**tldr:** I'm being taken advantage of by friends who (some knowing, others i am not sure) keep making me pay for their stuff. How to say no, even though I know they will have to struggle that instance? Probably need some tough love because when I am reading this back I feel so ashamed.

Edit: just wanted to point out that I mostly have very good and kind friends who don't do this to me, these are just a few instances. This is also what made me realize my ' problem' so late.

Edit2: just got home today, I'm overwhelmed with the response! I have skimmed through the replies and they are so helpful. I will not reply tonight (its almost midnight here and tomorrow is busy) but I am going to set some time aside tomorrow to read carefully through the advice, thank you all so much! I appreciate it very much that you took the effort to read my question and made very personal responses!

**Edit 3**: okay I just woke up and started off my morning with reading through the responses and got on my laptop to write this edit. I have gone through a first quarter of the messages and responded here and there but I am not able to respond to everyone but please know that I read everything because you guys are insightful! I‚Äôm not sure how to show my appreciation other than to say thanks, so, thanks! I‚Äôm going to take my time reading the rest. I feel more educated now and am going to make getting more educated a priority.

Based on you advice I have a list that I‚Äôm going to translate into to do‚Äôs! Here‚Äôs some points:

* Say no, because no is a full sentence.
* Open up a new savings account at a separate bank account than the one I have my checking account. I will look into this this weekend and will hopefully have an appointment at a bank next week (I probably won‚Äôt be able to set up an account right away because that usually involves actually having money to put on the account lol, next month.). I will put at least 10% of my salary on my savings. This way, I can more confidently say to someone that I would rather split the bill because I don‚Äôt have money instead of going to savings.
* Save up a small amount of money (I begin at 1 euro a month) that I will put away for meals with friends.
* Build a pantry. I deserve more surprise beans in my life. Also, then I can offer friends frozen pizza or self made spaghetti instead of soggy dominos that is cut infuriatingly asymmetrical. I need to think ahead. I also really like to cook for people when I have time and opportunity to do so.
* Popcorn apparently is filling food. I make and will consume more. My mother has LIED to me.
* Read recommended books!

And also some painful but necessary reminders:

* don‚Äôt set yourself on fire to keep others warm! and: their lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your behalf.
* I perhaps have some more unlearning and readjustment to do than I initially thought because this does reflect my way of thinking about my finances, and about me as well. Yikes. I would rather just stock up beans in my pantry.
* (this got downvoted a bit but I do agree:) people don‚Äôt force me to spend money on them, let alone expensive take out pizza (while frozen delicious pizza is only max 2 euros). I can say no, so I should do so. My finances is my responsibility. I can prioritise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9n9mcm/how_to_stop_paying_for_everyone_and_protect_my/,2102,That friend was helping you with an assignment that you had been struggling with all week.

If this is against any rules, please take down.

I started using the app called Mealime in September and it has changed my life. It is a free app, I get it through iOS. You pick meals that you're interested in making for the week and it creates a grocery list for you. Then when you are ready to cook it gives you step by step instructions. It also has an option for picking meals together that use up the same ingredients, so you aren't letting anything perishable go to waste. The meals are using mostly fresh produce and they have the option to change preferences based off of allergies and foods you dislike. 

Before mealime I would have a really hard time grocery shopping. I didn't know how to shop for meals. Instead I would just get random stuff that I thought maybe could feed me throughout the week. Usually this was sweet potatoes and frozen chicken breasts. I would end up not getting enough food and eat out, spending through my food budget, getting depressed, and not feeling healthy. 

Since using mealime, I'm gotten my food budget for the week down to a science. I have favorite meals that I will use consistently, and sometimes i'll feel spontaneous and try something new. The meals sizes you can choose are 2 servings to 6 servings. I'm a single person so I do the 2. Sometimes I will cook for both me and my boyfriend or I will take leftovers for lunch the next day to work. I've noticed how much healthier I've felt, I actually like what I'm eating, I'm enjoying cooking, and I've saved so much money because mealime is forcing me to plan out my meals throughout the week. Usually I'll chose 3 meals for the week, then get a couple things I can make quick on days I'm not super hungry/short on time (Potatoes, quick soups, rice).

&#x200B;

I started dating this amazing woman who didn't grow up poor, and i was astonished to find that a huge difference between our saving and spending habits came from the fact that she was taught about finances at an early age. Where i spend money on food because i get scared ill go hungry she buys what she needs and saves. Where i cant always see how spending 5$here and 110 $ there is bad she counts every dollar, and as such can really save.

This kind of inspired me- i started learning about different financial terminology, the basics of budgeting adn saving, and other stuff- the truth is that i learned SO MUCH. I'm still not in the best place financially. I have no savings- I am only starting to pay off debt, but in the end even the small steps im taking is making a huge difference.  so in the spirit of this i want to share what i've learned because maybe itll help someone.

# Banking 101

Ok so, banks may seem like the most basic thing ever- but the truth is for a long time i didnt even want a bank account, it seemed like a useless way to store money that i needed and way gonna use. Plus overdraft fees terrified me. Turns out I was holding myself back quite a bit.

&#x200B;

Important definitions: 

* **Bank:** a financial establishment that invests money deposited by customers, pays it out when required, makes loans at interest, and exchanges currency.
* **Credit union: t**ype of¬†financial co-operative.  They're nonprofit-making money cooperative whose members can borrow from pooled deposits at low interest rates.
* **FDIC:** The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (**FDIC**) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of bank failures. They insure that in the event of a bank failing you get some of your money insured.
* **Annual Percentage Yield** ‚Äì APY is the amount of interest you‚Äôll get on the money you have deposited in your bank account each year. It‚Äôs the amount the bank pays you for keeping funds in their account. used for savings accounts.
* **Deposit:** The cash you put into a bank account, the bank holds this money for you and either holds it or invests it.
* **Balance:**  How much money is in your account
* **Available Balance:** How much money you actually have access to
* **Overdraft**: When you take too much money out of an account and your balance is negative. Banks sometimes have fees for this

SO with all that out of the way...

# Why have a bank account? 

The truth is in today's market you don't always need one. Before when i didn't have one i would cash my cheques directly for about 3$. The teller at the store knew me, and sometimes would let me get an extra 10 or 20$ in advance, knowing that id have a cheque for her later.  As i started earning more though I also realized a few things: 

* Building a credit history:  people need to know you, wanna get an apartment?  need credit. wanna get a cerd? a loan? anything? credit.
* Banks keep money safe: its not safe to carry around 100s of dollars. This seems obvious but the anxiety i felt coming home with cash in my bag was ridiculous. Not only that my apartment got broken into and my computer stolen- what if they'd found my cash too? 
* Its actually more convenient:  Wanna buy shit online? done. Wanna use plastic for everything? done. wanna do literally anything that requires a card? done. 
* You can save:  So eventually the hope is that youre making more money than youre spending. Its used to be that if that happened i would just spend that too. But no- a savings account actually allows you to keep that money away, safe, where you need it for emergencies or whatever. 

Ok so all of that probably seemed really obvious. It wasnt for me and maybe i'm a dumbass, I get that. So finally lets talk about...

# Opening an account

&#x200B;

First- Bank or Co-op?

Big banks have the advantage of convenience and the ability to be everywhere, that said Co-ops tend to be more family friendly, you get to know the community, are much more personal, and usually have better loans. Honestly here its all about preference. I have an account with a local Co-op, which gives me access to a lot of great  offers- but i also have a bank account with a big bank. The big bank u use for checking, the co-op for savings. It works for me. Look at what you have nearby and what they require and choose what fits you best. 

Second you need to choose what type of account, for the sake of this guide we'll talk about checking and savings. 

|Checking account|Savings account|
|:-|:-|
|Used to store money, pay bills, get a card, write cheques|Used to store money long term, save money, build an emergency fund|

So once youve identified what kind of account youll be getting you need to figure out where you want to open one- so what should we be looking for? 

&#x200B;

Checking:

* Look for accounts that have no monthly fees. You dont want to lose money by paying a fee every month jsut to store money in the account. 
* No overdraft fees. Right now theres a wide enough selection that you can get an account with no overdraft fees- protecting you from the RIDICULOUS fees that can come with an overdraft. 
* Good online presence. The truth is nowadays having a convenient way to look at your accounts wherever is super amazing and useful.  Even my tiny co-op has an app.

Savings: 

* Look for higher interest/APY the higher the more they pay you for keeping your money in there
* Look for accounts with no monthly fees. Seriously, youre already giving them your money dont let them keep it. 
* Mobile deposits. For those of us who get paper cheques its nice to just snap a pic. 
* No transfer fees. Most of the time you open a checking and savings account together- you can only transfer money out of a savings account a certain amount of times a month before they start charging you, this is due to federal regulatory stuff- keep an eye on it. 

So now youve found some account you like with banks you think are ok- whats next? 

&#x200B;

To open an account you need a minimum deposit- this varies depending on your bank. Some require just 1.50$ others 25$, others 50$ I suggest writing whatever your deposit is as money lost and ALWAYS keep that minimum there. That said i can never do that, but hey- dont be like me, be better than me. 

&#x200B;

So what now? 

&#x200B;

Thats it, thats this guide. Note that there are many other checking accounts, savings accounts, money market, IRA, and a bunch of other bullshit. The truth is that when your poor that shit is out of our league. just having a good checking and savings account is a huge step for a lot of us- so with this guide i wanted to start there.

I work at Panera; at the end of the day, we collect and package almost all of our bread and pastries for local charities. I say almost since we still end up tossing ALL of our unused, sliced bread every single night. If nobody shows up for the donated goods, that also ends up in the trash.

542,cd70lo,False,None,179,PSA: Phone number theft is a thing.,povertyfinance,"Hey guys. I just want to bring awareness to phone number phishing. Most of us here are pretty broke and probably living paycheck to paycheck, but if you are someone that has a contracted cell phone account with one of the big four, Sprint, ATT, Tmobile, or Verizon, this message is for you. I work for one of the big 4 carriers.

&#x200B;

The phishers steal your pin ... somehow. Either they phish you with a spoofed text or phone call, they hang out at Bestbuy and listen to you speak with an actual bestbuy employee, or they are a legit employee that sells your info, or your info is on the dark web.

&#x200B;

Next, the phisher calls in with your name, pin, address, and phone number. Sometimes they don't even know what phone number they're calling in about. It might be your 8 year old's phone number, it might even be the number attached to your apple watch or your tablet. Or, it's YOUR phone number attached to your bank account.

&#x200B;

While they are calling in to get your account number, they are at Walmart or some other indirect authorized retailer purchasing a tracfone or straight talk phone. They immediately set up a port to take your number to their burner.

&#x200B;

Within minutes of completing the transaction, they access your bank account. The bank account sends a secure verification pin to YOUR phone number, which is now on their phone.

&#x200B;

Ta-da. Your bank is then emptied via paypal, venmo, or 7 giftcards at walmart.

&#x200B;

A couple hours later, your child or friend is trying to call you, but they can't get through. They send you a text (which will probably work if your phone is on wifi). You call in to get tech support. You learn your number has been disconnected. You then put 2 and 2 together. Earlier, your bank or credit card company alerted you to suspected fraud.

&#x200B;

You now have to file a police report for identity theft. And did you know that stealing a phone number is not a crime, and many police departments WILL NOT FILE A REPORT? The only way to file the report is to bring proof from your bank or your credit card company that someone attempted to withdraw funds (or were successful.)

&#x200B;

Now, anyone that texts or calls your phone number goes to the person that stole it. If you are a business owner, your clients are calling and potentially leaving their identifying information on voice mails or texts. And the process continues.

&#x200B;

**TLDR; I urge you, if you have a postpaid contracted account with the big 4, call customer service and request a port freeze or port protection. Ask for specific ""hot remarks"" or notes on your account stating to NEVER allow a number to port out. Because you are a target and you don't even know it. Never give out your pins, passwords, or last four of your SSN. If anyone EVER contacts you and tries to tell you that your account is compromised and they need one of those things, they're fucking lying. We will** ***never ever ever ever ever*** **call YOU and ask for your pin over the phone. We do a COMPLETELY different type of verification if WE call YOU.**

&#x200B;

**Edit: Lots of people asking about prepaid accounts, I don't see it happen often, but it does happen. My speculation is because there is no SSN attached to prepaid accounts, it isn't going to be useful to try and take the account. With postpaid, your SSN and address will always be there if you try to break into someone's account.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/cd70lo/psa_phone_number_theft_is_a_thing/,2056,"Make sure you have two step verification setup with your cell provider, it will prevent this from happening ",2019-07-14 19:22:58

It was enlightening. Heres the top 7 things I did NOT buy

1. Number one thing i wanted to buy, but did not need, was.... ALCOHOL AT BARS. Approximate total that I would have spent was $36. I did make myself many mystery cocktails this week using what was in my bar at home.

2: SNACKS. I used a few recipe sites to find out what I could make at home usong whats already in the cupboards. Turns out, it was A LOT.

3: ice cream. I have a thrifted ice cream maker. I had eggs. I had sugar, milk, and just a smidge less cream than the recipe called for, but this is easily the best ice cream Ive ever made anyway.

4: Uber rides. I walked. I realized most of my rides were under 2 miles. So i walked. I lost 2 lbs this week and saved about $30.

5: cat toys. I spent an hour  hot gluing the feather toys back together and my cats did not notice they were not new.

6: laundry: i have a portable washer. I hung my clothes to dry. Laundry was free mc free all week.

7: books and movies: HELLO LIBRARY!!

ZERO ZERO ZERO DOLLARS.

These are just the 7 things I repeatedly wanted to buy this week... but chose not to buy.

A list of the nonrecurring items of thing I WANTED to buy is fucking stupid, but heres a sample:

UV light for cat pee (just used my nose for free), a laser automatic cat toy (i got a laser on my keychain, and i am not that lazy), a swimsuit (still gonna buy this, but I will shop arpund for prices), a proper bread machine (i have one from a thrift store, but it only does 1 setting. I will check other thrift stores for a multi setting bread maker).

I feel personally so gratified to see a gap in my online bank statement between july 18 and july 24th  with zero debits.

I don't really have anyone to tell this to but you. 

This summer I had no car, a job barely above minimum wage that I hated (hotel front desk is not the ideal job, trust me), and almost no money. I was sleeping on a makeshift bed in my dad's living room. I saved everything I could, which was most of my income thanks to my dad covering the mortgage and most of the groceries (thank you, dad). 

This fall I moved out to go back to school and got an apartment with two friends off campus. I also got my first office job, an internship in software engineering. There was a gap of about a month between quitting my old job and starting my new one, and buying a car was the last of my money. I started the school year and my job with less than $50 to my name, plus a car loan for a few thousand and a maxed-out credit card, thankfully with a $500 limit. 

Now, 4 months later, I am making regular payments on my car loan and credit card, and can pay my bills on time. 

The reason I'm writing this is that I just put $20 into my savings account. I haven't had money that wasn't immediately needed for something since I moved in. It's almost surreal.

Financial Information:
Job: Inside sales. (27K base, extra 13K if quota is reached)

Rent $736 a month

All Bills: Approx. $200 a month. The season is a factor.

How we did it:
Canned foods, Intermittent fasting to put us at 2 meals max. Paid off my vehicle with double employment. Cheap meals where leftovers gave us 2-3 meals a week. Light prepping in the pantry, so we wouldn't have to shop if something kept us in. MOST IMPORTANT: Odd Jobs. I made some very decent money on ranches, and farms. Hard work but it paid.

It's fourteen years old, over 200k miles, but dammit it runs well and the radio's loud so I love it. It has a few dings and scratches and the check engine light won't go off (coolant sensor, not an actual coolant problem), so I'm used to ignoring little problems.

Don't ignore little problems.

This weekend I was pulled over. The cop said, ""So I have about three different things to ask you about, but it's all related to the one thing. Did you know your tail light is out?"" No I didn't, but I wasn't surprised. He asked for my insurance, which I have the app for on my phone... and the damn thing didn't remember my password and neither did I. So I had no immediate proof of insurance, a big no-no. I have since rectified that (hey folks, put a screenshot of it in your photo folder or State Farm has an extra little gadget you can put on your phone's home screen just for such an occasion). The cop just ran my driving record to make sure I'd never been cited for driving with no insurance while I thanked God I never got pulled over during the year I did so a few years back (not recommended, it saved a few bucks but was awful for my anxiety and would have been catastrophic in an emergency).

He let me go with a warning to get my tail light fixed and my insurance card up to snuff, and went on his way. I immediately drove my butt to NAPA and put a new tail light in for $1.38.

As I was putting it in, I realized that I am incredibly lucky. I have a good driving record, and wasn't committing any real infractions (I was even signalling, though he couldn't see it). Any of those things otherwise could easily have ruined my day, or my driving record. It happens all the time.

Keep an eye on the little things. Don't ignore them. Keep yourself healthy, folks.

Edited to remove unintentionally incendiary topic. Folks, I only put this up as a friendly reminder to keep up on the details because they snowball so very easily. I know I dodged a bullet, and have since learned that I can't trust a phone app. I'll be fixing the paper copy situation tonight.

This might be your case, too.",povertyfinance,"This is in response to the many criticisms of this sub becoming a circle jerk with no practical advice to get people out of poverty. 

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm still not financially stable enough to find r/PersonalFinance helpful. I still have a mountain of student loan debt that doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing anywhere. And I still don‚Äôt make much above the average American income. But, I‚Äôm no longer impoverished. I no longer have to chose between food and gas. I own a house and have a new-ish (10 years old instead of 20 years old) reliable car. 

Getting diagnosed with ADHD in 2017 when I was 27 was the real turning point for me. My entire adult life, I could see the top of the mountain, but not the paths to get there. Medication, cognitive behavior therapy and lifestyle modifications helped me clear away the clouds and see the necessary steps to get me where I am now. Everyone‚Äôs case is so different and I can neither diagnose nor give you a ton of career advice, but if you‚Äôd like to know more about my personal experience I‚Äôm happy to elaborate.

EDIT: I had a hunch that there might be folks out there who would benefit from this conversation. I think there's a lot of ADHD folks represented on reddit compared to the general public. Maybe the format appeals to our brains? A lot of us aren't diagnosed though. Despite what the media says about ADHD, experts believe it is actually grossly underdiagnosed, especially demographics outside of young, white boys. So I had a thought if reddit appeals to ADHDrs and most of us aren't diagnosed, those that aren't diagnosed are probably struggling financially. I thought a little anecdotal PSA here couldn't hurt.

573,ale8y6,False,None,286,A Warning About TurboTax,povertyfinance,"I went to file my taxes yesterday the same way I have done for several years, with the TurboTax free file. I noticed a few things that I thought I'd share: 

When I got to the section for the child and dependent care credit, the software kept telling me that I don't qualify. I knew that I still qualified for the credit so I googled it. Turns out, when you enter your W2 at the beginning for you and your spouse, it defaults both of them to one persons name (so it appeared that I made too much money for the credit, while my husband had no income). As soon as I went back and assigned one of the W2 to my husband I qualified for the credit, which boosted my refund by $600. 

Because I filed for a specific credit, TT software said I needed to pay the $39.99 as the free software didn't cover one of the forms I'd need done to file. I was already finished by this point and was getting money back so I figured ok, I'll pay it, and that I will just file by hand next year. TT gave me the option to pay this fee out of my refund, saying something like ""no need to reach for your wallet, we can just take this from your refund"". Nowhere on this page did it indicate that there would be a fee to do so. When I was completely done and ready to file, TT asked me to consent to the charges and hit submit. I noticed that the fees suddenly went from $39.99 to 79.99 and I didn't understand why until I searched the internet and found dozens of complaints from last year. Apparently TT is charging an extra $39.99 in order for them to take the original fee from your return with very little explanation and quite deceptive language on their website. I paid the original fee with my credit card and filed without issue. 

I know this is a bit strange and I am not trying to blast TT in general, but I do think it is fair that people be aware of these fees and quirks of the software. Hope this helps someone!

574,dp9qhk,False,None,450,Should I drop out of college and get into a trade? Scared of facing homelessness and extreme poverty as a student,povertyfinance,"I turn 21 soon. At a local community college that does not have dorms. I'll be halfway done with an associates degree after this semester. 

I won't be able to live at my moms house anymore soon, hopefully this happens after semester ends. I definitely can not afford a place with my current part-time job and even with a roommate (which i'm looking into!) I still don't think I would be able to afford much more than rent. And I realize that not being able to afford all basic needs is going to have an impact on school.

I'm considering dropping out of college and starting an electricians apprenticeship. I will be paid a living wage, full-time job with on the job training. I'm told there's good money in it after a while. I'll actually be able to afford rent, food, bills, gasoline, and a safe place to live for the next couple years while I'm working. I'm going to get a room mate soon any way. 

I'm scared of the student loans I will have to take on if I continue with school.

I'm thinking maybe I can be farther ahead by the time I finish the apprenticeship vs by the time I finish my bachelors and try to find a job. 

I'm scared and don't know what to do.

Do not drop out. Do finish this semester. But then it is not ""dropping out"", it is putting your formal education on a break. You can always go back after a year or two or a decade or two. We will still be here for you. Or maybe you'll be entirely happy with the trade and won't ever want to go back to school, and that is ok too.

If you can't finish up the semester, due to logistics, do be sure to officially ""withdraw"" from all your classes. Don't leave them on record and end up with all F's. Also, before making any final decision to drop out mid-semester, be sure to check if there is any impact on financial aid - usually dropping all your classes only has an adverse impact on potential future financial aid, but in some situations you might have to pay things back.

591,av9q4m,False,None,183,[Poverty Recipe] Endless Bread for under $4,povertyfinance,"I've seen a few posts here and there about ""I have paid all my bills, I have $28 in my checking account, how do I make it last until I get paid in two weeks?"" and this post is an attempt to give you at least one option.

'Biga' is Italian starter dough. In ancient times, Italian artisan bakers didn't have instant yeast like we do today, so they would save a small portion of the dough used each day, and use it as the starter dough the next day. 

You can make biga and keep it on your counter or in your fridge, and it will allow you to continue to make bread forever as long as you continue to 'feed' it, hence the title *endless bread*.

You primary ingredients for biga are all-purpose flour, instant yeast, and warm water.

I use Gold Medal all-purpose flour, which costs $1.98 at my local Walmart for a five lb bag. You can find store brands much cheaper than that, even as low as $.99, but I like GM flour. What brand you use is immaterial, use your favorite brand or a cheap store brand near you, they all work. 
 
Fleischmann's  Active Dry Yeast sells for $1.39 for three packets at Target near me, some places sell one packet for $.99 or less, you only need one packet for our recipe here. If you like to bake and want to get three packets, go ahead and spend the $1.39, but we only need one packet for this recipe.

So, we've spent $1.98 on a 5 lb bag of flour and $1.39 on three packets of active dry yeast, so we've spent $3.37, under our $4 limit. 

Making the biga is simple. 

Open the bag of flour, measure out three cups of flour, and pour into a large mixing bowl. Take the packet of yeast, measure out 1/2 a teaspoon, and sprinkle it over the flour. (I've seen estimates that each packet contains 2.25 teaspoons of yeast, but just measure out 1/2 a teaspoon. This is why we only need one packet of active dry yeast.) If you don't have something to measure half a teaspoon, a tablespoon equals three teaspoons, so 1/6 of a tablespoon is 1/2 a teaspoon. If you end up putting in 1/3 of a tablespoon, or one full teaspoon, don't sweat it. You only need 1/2 a teaspoon to make the biga, but it's not going to be an issue if you use a little more in the recipe. 

Take a wooden spoon (recommended, but any spoon will do, even plastic ones), and stir your flour and dried yeast for 10-20 seconds, just mix them up a little. 

Now pour in 1 3/4 cups of warm water. You do not want hot water, it will kill the yeast. Warm water. Measure temp with your fingers. Think baby bathwater warm. Lukewarm is also fine. 

Stir all of the flour, yeast, and water together for approximately four minutes. You want to incorporate all of the flour and yeast into the water. When all of the water and flour is incorporated, it will make a soupy wet consistency. 

Cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 8-24 hours. You will see the biga bubble as the yeast feeds on the flour and begin to rise and fall over the 8-24 hours, this is normal. You can use the biga after 8 hours, but the longer you wait, the more character and flavor develops, so waiting 24 hours is best. 

After 24 hours, you have your starter dough. 

If you don't want to refrigerate your biga, you can keep it at room temperature and use it to make bread every day for the next two weeks, just make sure you leave save some of the biga to act as your starter for the next day. If you refrigerate your biga, you can use it to make bread once a week, and keep it for perpetuity as long as you keep 'feeding' it after every use, hence *endless bread*. 

When 'feeding' biga, you replace what you take. So if I take one cup of biga to use as my starter in a recipe, I replace it with half a cup of water and half a cup of flour. You pour the water and flour into the bowl with the remaining biga, give it a good mix to incorporate it, and voila, your feeding is done. You don't **have** to replace at a 1:1 ratio, I just find that it is the one that works best for me. 

I currently have a bowl of biga in my fridge that is still going strong into its third week. I know of a case where a famous pizzaiolo in California and NY had his biga for going over seven months when he was interviewed for an article several years ago. As time goes on, the new flour entered in with the feeding continues to grow and feed on itself, and you essentially replace all of the original biga. You have basically created a living organism that provides you endless food just by feeding it every day or once a week. 

You can use the biga to make you basic Italian bread, make pizza dough, make rolls. I have used it to make Italian bread, pizza dough, sandwich rolls, and bread sticks these past two weeks.

**Basic Italian bread recipe**

One cup of biga     
3 cups of all purpose flour     
1 teaspoon of salt              
1-1.25 cups of warm water                    
1 tablespoon olive oil or cooking oil                     
    
Take your one cup of biga, and put it into a bowl. Pour half of the warm water into the bowl, let slowly massage the biga in the water with your hand, letting is saturate. Pour in three cups of flour, one at a time, mixing it into the water and biga with a spoon or with your hands. Pour in the teaspoon of salt. Mix it until all the flour is incorporated and you begin to get a shaggy dough. If you're doing it with your hands, this will take one to two minutes of mixing. If you're using an electric mixer, this will take about one minute for the dough to form. 

After the dough has formed, shape it into a ball, and leave it in the bowl for 20 minute. Set a timer, and walk away. After the 20 minutes has passed, spend 30 seconds to one minute kneading the dough with your hands into a soft, supple ball. The dough should shape easily into a smooth, satiny ball. 
     
Top the dough ball with one tablespoon of olive oil or cooking oil, put it in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise until doubled in size. It may take up to 3 hours, that's fine, let it take as long as it needs, if your kitchen is warm, it may rise faster. 

After it has doubled in sized, remove the plastic wrap, punch it down, and take it out of the bowl. Roll it into a ball again, and cut the ball in half. You easily have enough dough for two loaves of bread.      
      
Using your hands, shape the dough into two elongated strips, almost like you're shaping sub bread.    
    
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. If you don't have parchment paper, lightly flour the bottom of the tray so the dough doesn't stick. Put the two dough loaves on the baking tray, and let rise for a second time for one hour.    
   
At the 45 minute mark, preheat your oven to 450 degrees. 
       
After the second rise, the dough will flatten a little and spread out. Put the tray in the oven, and bake at 450 for 30 minutes, or until the crust turns a nice golden brown color. If you think it is done before 30 minutes, remove from the oven, and tap the bottom of the loaf. If it is done, it will sound hollow. 
    
Let cool for 15 minutes, and then slice and eat. It tastes great by itself, but even better with butter or cream cheese. You make this right, you will never need to buy garlic bread or fresh bread from a bakery again.

596,cix2u2,False,None,302,I'm making $13.50 per hour with an Aerospace Engineering degree. Need advice. It's really stressing me out.,povertyfinance,"I already posted this on 2 other subreddits and everyone has been of great help since I was keeping this to myself but the stress was too much and I wanted to talk to someone. 
And as someone who is an avid looker here on Povertyfinance, I wanted to hear your advice.

Long story short, I have an Aerospace Engineering degree with 1 year experience with the current company I work at. I started in production not working as an engineer but as a production employee, then moved to another position as a technician assistant operating HAAS machines, then to the office to work in the quality department as an administrator.
So far my hourly rate is $13.50 per hour. I haven't had a raise in a year or when I was moving up positions. I understand that it's really low for engineers but I had to take that offer last year because I had no experience. 
The company where I work at is currently having some slowdown in production but will eventually be more busy in the upcoming months. 
Should I wait a couple of months more for things to start picking up again or should I do it now? Not sure when it's the right time to do it since it's my first job out of college as an engineer. I have been given more responsibilities around the office as people have seen that I have the skills to do whatever they put me to do 

I currently live in California and not working as an Aerospace engineer but as a Quality administrator.


I love what I'm doing and my colleagues are awesome. Just the pay is what is really killing me since everything in California, especially in Orange County is really expensive and it's really frustrating and depressing. I can't relocate because I need to help my family. I'm single but I'm helping my sister who is a college student and parents who are of old age.

Edit: Im single currently live in California with an Aerospace Engineering degree. Currently not working as an Aerospace engineer but as a Quality administrator making $13.50 per hour. Best time to ask for a raise?

But I finally got a place with enough counter space to allow me to get a griddle, and it is so amazing what that allows me to do.

For example, tonight's meal consisted of grill-toasted sesame italian bread, corn, green beans, and broccoli. It was so amazingly tasty.

Here's how it went down:

1. Bag of frozen corn into the micro - Great Value now can micro in the bag - it called for 6 minutes, I did 5.
2. Grabbed butter, salt, bacon, lemon juice, and MSG, all ready to go.
3. Corn done, micro green beans for a min less than it called for, toss corn into a pot with butter and salt and 1/4C water on high, stirring and cooking the water out until the corn was mostly ""dry"" so the butter sticks to the corn, divide onto plates for my wife and me.
4. Turn on griddle to get it warm.
5. Grab green beans from micro, put in broc for a min less than called for
6. Green beans into pot with real bacon pieces (cheap as whole bacon, but lasts a lot longer and very convenient - I added a teaspoon in the pot), bacon, salt, and another scant 1/4 cup of water. Stirred on high heat until, again, the moisture was basically gone. Divided onto plates. Meanwhile, melted butter on the griddle - I take a stick of butter, unwrap it, hold it by the wrapper so it's vertical, and butter the griddle surface. Then cut slices off the bread - Texas toast thick, two slices each, put on the griddle and swirl around a bit to soak up all the butter on the griddle.
7. Broc in the pot with salt, a scant teaspoon of lemon juice, butter. Stir until the lemon juice is basically gone, so again, dry enough that the butter sticks. Should see this as a pattern by now. Also pull the bread, re-butter the griddle, and toast the other side.

All the veggies are delicious. Add spices - garlic, pepper would be great. Many ways to change things up, but I really like my veggies simple. Forgot to say I toss on a sprinkle of MSG right before I pull them to the plate just for that extra umami kick.

It was an amazing dinner, and quick to prepare. I walked into the kitchen and the three veggies nuked for 5 min, 6 min, and 5 min - so that's 16 minutes. And the broc must've sauteed for less than four mins, so it was nearly but not quite 20 mins from the time I walked into the kitchen to the time dinner was served. 

I soaked the pot before I came in here, so now I have one teflon pot to wash, and a paper towel to wipe down the griddle (yes, disposable, but it gets the oil off easily).

57¬¢ for the corn and the green beans, 98¬¢ for the broc, about 1/3 of a $1 loaf of bread, half a stick of butter at about 35¬¢. Salt and MSG are pennies, if that. So around $2.75 to feed two, and did I mention it was delicious? And tasty enough I didn't miss meat? ",2018-09-28 22:51:54

613,9r7yhb,False,None,124,I'm finally breaking the cycle.,povertyfinance,"To set the stage - 
In 2006, I was broke, freshly transplanted to  major city California, and had 1 job, 30 something hours a week as a baggage handler at the airport.  
I made $11 an hour, and slept on the couch of a friend's apartment.  I never set foot in a grocery store.  Everything was fast food.
I lasted 3 months.  Failed.  Moved back home.
2007 and 2008 had the same cycle.  Pick a state.  Move.  Find a job.  Find a roommate.   Fail.  Move back home.

In 2009, I started college, a cheap university high up in the mountains.  
A Pell Grant was enough to cover all my expenses, and I could have lived modestly.  4 easy years, living on the governments dime while I got a degree.

Instead... Shitty friends, fast food, weed, and booze. A car I couldn't afford but looked good.  New clothes to not wear to the classes I skipped.

In 2011, I failed out.  Car had been repo'd.  Work fired me for missing days.  Bank charged me for overdrafts. Rent came due in a hurry, and I didn't have it.

I had no job.  I was becoming homeless.  
I stayed in a shelter for 6 weeks, working as a dishwasher in a buffet, and server in a dine-in pizza place.  I saved all my money, for 5 full weeks... and blew most on drugs and alcohol.  Its amazing how many friends you accumulate when they're drinking your beer for free.

When the money ran out... The party stopped.  And I failed again.  Crashed hard.

I sold everything I owned, and mom chipped in the rest for a bus ticket.

In 2012, I moved back to my home state (in my late 20's) with $0 in my pocket, half a bag of rolling tobacco, and my skateboard. 
The only good thing in my life... Was my credit was too shitty for a credit card.  So i had no CC debt.  I was truly at $0.

I slept on the living room floor of an old friend's rental house, because the couch was already claimed.
I got on SNAP benefits.
I found a job.  $10 an hour.
I spent as little as possible.
Found a trailer to rent.  Found a better company doing the same work...
  
And for 6 years, I've done my best.  
And it has been hard. 

Like... Grown man lying in bed breaking down crying in fear and stress and anger and frustration, and somehow...
Lasting one more day.  Telling myself... This is not your best.  This is good for now, this is a good today, and I can make tomorrow better. 

I've worked on my own car, taken side jobs, asked for raises and more hours, and accepted any task thrown at me.  
Scrub food out of the floor sinks in the kitchen every night?   Ok.
Work from 5am to 230pm, then go assist from 9pm to 3am on a grease trap replacement inside a restaurant?  Sure.
Drive an hour every day to the jobsite?   You've got it.

 
Now, I'm soon to be married.  Stepkids.  A house in the near future.  A car loan.  A solid job.  A company vehicle.

We paid our wedding off already.  $100 a week each, instead of dining out or going to the movies or buying makeup or clothes.  It took almost 7 months.  

I've learned how to cook for 5 people for $100 a week.  $20 per person for 12-15 meals, since the kids are still in school.  Eggs and potatoes and onions go far.  Pasta is a mainstay.  Rice is a miracle filler.  

We pack lunches and take snacks to work. 
I wait for the sales on brand name cereal and buy 10 boxes for $15. I buy a dozen gatorades when they're 58 cents each through the grocery store app, instead of $2 each at the gas station.  I go to the spanish grocer for cheap produce and off brand cleaning supplies.  

We buy clothes from discount racks, and entertainment secondhand.  Bikes and video games are from CL or Letgo.
Fish and turtles are dirt cheap pets, and you can find a tank for $10 or less.  
A football or soccer ball is maybe $5 at goodwill, and gets the kids out of the apartment and playing with friends.

Our next goal is to stop paying rent, and start paying a mortgage.  We'll get there.

I've been seriously working on Me, for 6 years now, so I didn't repeat the cycle again.  I didn't have a car for almost 3 years.  It took me 4 years before I had an emergency fund.  It took 5 years before the money in savings stayed there.  

And it's working.

It's getting better.

And if I can do it... Me, the loser pothead dropout failure with crooked shoulders and scrawny arms, that used to make your pizza, mad at the world, and deep down... Hating myself for being the situation I was in..

If I can do it...
You can.

616,8mjqo1,False,None,301,"I make an extra $1,000 or more every month with beer money sites AMA!",povertyfinance,"Hey everyone. I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/?ref=share&ref_source=link) a few weeks back detailing how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through the use of beermoney sites. Beermoney is, according to Urban Dictionary, ""Extra money for non-essential payments, available for spending on luxuries, hobbies, or a fresh pint of your favorite draft."" I use this definition, because this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. 

As I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will explain why I chose this as a way to make money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. 

Since getting married, I have needed extra money for various bills and saving for things we wanted (down payment on a home). Essentially, I was just tired of barely scraping by every month after tax and savings. Because of this, I have been investing more time in all of these sites over the last 6 or 7 months and the cash flow has been steadily increasing as time goes on. I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner (I am 3 months ahead on payments), have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates, and have built my emergency fund to six months of bills. I am now also able to wake up and see that money came in while I slept. It has been rad.

I personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix, rather than having to listen to another boss everyday, worry about getting fired, and deal with more people. This works better for my temperament and my preferences. 

The tech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. 

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).

I went to college where tuition was $65K, more than what my parents made a year, luckily the school was need-based and offered a pretty good financial aid package, though as every year progressed I was required to take out more loans. I was determined to ensure that my parents would not pay more than what was necessary, so I applied for fellowships, and internal scholarships. When I finally graduated I was in 10k worth of loans, I know it's not a lot compared to other graduates, but to someone who lived paycheck to paycheck, it was daunting. So I decided to do a year of service, in hopes of earning an education award that could be used to pay half of my loans. There were many times I wanted to quit, given that I was a recent graduate, and was yet again living paycheck to paycheck. I finished my year of service, moved back to my home state, with a job lined up.

Poverty financiers, please, stop eating out or buying random junk food. It is not worth it. I am redoing my budget, pulling from my savings to cover my monthly expenses deficient this month(sadly) and it is a sad feeling. I had a goal to save $100.00 month. It is not clear if I can make it. 

My problem is that I am under a lot of stress (first year teacher, every day is hell), and I am a huge emotional eater. I will have to find another way to get the stress out (I'm maxed out at the gym, going 6 days a week of heavy weight training and swimming. Maybe more video games? Post workout after teaching?)

Slamming my forehead against the wall on this one. 

Edit: Thanks for the silver! My first! 
",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/azfqy5/just_a_friendly_reminder_to_stop_eating_outbuying/,1732,"I would suggest against video games (from someone who has played them most of his life)....they are fun but its not going to help you deal with stress and you will probably gain weight from sitting around as you play them. I would suggest meditation instead...about 30 min worth of just sitting and deep breaths. Get yourself a guided meditation cd if necessary but just looking at a candle is enough. 

If you do want to try some gaming just keep it under control and pick something that isn't competitive but some open world RPG were you can just run around solo and chill while trying some random stuff or where you can get immersed in the story.  So  like Skyrim, Assassins Creed Odyssey, etc or some fighting game where you can play a few matches and put it down. 

You don't need 6 days a week at the gym. Let your body rest and recover. 4-5 is fine. I used to go to the gym 6 days a week and I cut it down after a while and I also had a very fast metabolism so I was going broke from eating a ton to keep up with the energy burn. Also keep in mind your body needs time to heal. 

Also have you considered just sitting on the couch and reading a book? You find a good book its a great way to get rid of stress in the evening after the gym or just when you want to forget about your day...or just Netflix and chill. I would spend an hour just watching tv after the gym if I did not feel like reading. 

If you are eating out too much do what I do. Get some carrot sticks or some snap peas from the grocery store or other veggies and just put a few of them in a ziplock bag and take them with you and when you get a craving take them out and much on them. Veggies will keep you slim as well. Also works with oatmeal and health bars/oatmeal bars etc as they are pretty cheap.  A Thermos with some soup or tea or juice works well too. Cutting up some apples and taking them with you is another option. 

I buy  shit at different stores. I get my bag salads. veggies and euro type food or sandwich meat at Trader Joes/Aldis, I get my toiletries at Walmart, meat at Staters/Albertsons/cheap grocery store, and snacks/bars/other at the 99 cent store. You would be surpised how many good snacks you can find at the 99 cent store. Just get the stuff that has decent ingredients. Like recently I found this pack of 4 Belvita Soft baked breakfast banana bread health bars...99 cents...that shit would probably cost me $1.89 or $249 each at CVS or more.  Lots of ways to get stuff to take with you so you don't have to blow twice or 3 times as much buying it at convenience stores.

The most significant way that debt impacted my life is that I chose to wait to have children until my finances were under control - that was a mistake because now I can't get pregnant. 

Here is a brief history of my student loans. After taking about a decade to finish my bachelors, 3 years to finish law school, an entire year to pass the bar (I failed the first time) and about 4 - 5 years building my solo practice (which is still not entirely stable) I found myself with $270,000 of federal loan debt.

My original strategy was to use IBR and deal with the tax consequences later, however because I got married and felt it was unfair to my spouse to burden our household for the next 20 years with my financial mistake, I refinanced to obtain a lower interest rate and started paying off the debt. Because my resume sucks, my best financial option was and is to focus on building my practice and earn more money, which meant that when my husband had to relocate 700 miles away for his job, I couldn't move with him - so now we live apart. Indefinitely. And my body doesn't feel like growing another human being and even if I could get pregnant I still owe $106,000 in student loan debt and my partner still lives 700 hundred miles away. And so the world goes on ...

641,c6tcxk,False,None,131,Return 100% of the shit you do not need or use. Recaptured around $150 today!!,povertyfinance,"Im trying something new.

Instead of SAVING as the goal.... my new goal is to not buy things I do not need.

I started with simply RETURNING all of the dumb shit I did not need or use. Or bought thinking I might need or use something... that turns out... I neither needed nor used.

Hardware store: $63+ back -- I planned to grill this summer. I swear I made elaborate plans. I bought a mini grill for $58. And... I HAVE NOT USED IT IN THE 3 WEEKS SINCE I GOT IT. That went back to the store.

Grocery Store: $27 back. Yes, I did return the 42 oz of high-heat grill oil I bought a week back thinking I would grill. I HAVE NOT GRILLED. Returned!  Alongside the long grill tongs.. I did not need either of these things. So i returned them.

Hulu: ~$48 - How did I end up paying $15.99 for this? I cancelled my subscription, emailed customer service, and they refunded the last 3 mos of charges. I have not logged in for that pong. Thanks Hulu.

Netflix: $20. Not as generous, but you know what? I'm happy they refunded 2 mos of charges for something I wasnt fucking using at all when they could have chosen not to.

Was it a smidge embarassing to return an unopened walnut oil bottle to the grocery? A little. But not embarrassing enough to justify not getting my $16 back from this gentrified grease.

You know what's a lot more embarassing? Being $16 short on rent because I was too proud to return some shit I didn't need.

That's my brokeass thought.

646,ch5rze,False,None,111,The cycle has ended!!,povertyfinance,"After lurking on this sub for the better part of a year, I thought that I would share some good news about how this sub has helped me.

&#x200B;

For some background: I'm a 1st generation college student, ""aged-out"" foster youth who recently graduated after 7 years of trying. I suffered from a TBI during college, leaving me both disabled physically and partially mentally (both with mental health issues, a learning disability, and possible MS diagnosis). To top it off, I've been homeless 6+ times in my life, twice during my college career. During this ordeal, finances were my #1 concern since I don't have family to back me up when the going gets tough. This meant eating scraps during college 'winter break', crashing on someone's couch during a transition, or getting internships from cities multiple miles away so that they would offer me housing and pay over a long summer period.

&#x200B;

While the process wasn't pretty, I hadn't had formal access to budgeting or information about things like healthcare and 401k's. My upbringing didn't teach me and my university sure as heck didn't assist. That being said, this sub was my saving grace. This community has kept me out of the hole regarding credit card debt, bad credit scores, and high APR rates for car loans. As of today, I have just accepted a job offer of 63k/year (in the midwest) and start next week; this is 3x larger than my highest hourly rate since I started working at 16.

&#x200B;

I can't thank this community enough. You acted as both my parent and mentor giving me guidance when I needed it most. The best that I can do is make this hopefully inspiring post and give my heartfelt gratitude/advice to others. So, from the bottom of my heart; thank you.

Paying it off is a massive success - be proud of yourself, youve worked hard to get to this point! But the biggest challenge is actually breaking the habits that set you down that path in the first place. 

It took me years to pay off my credit card, then the balance grew and then it took me several months to pay off but then it grew again... It started with a few purchases that were over budget combined with an ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got all this extra money now‚Äù attitude and then suddenly my balance was more than I could pay off with my pay check - it was a slippery slope back to square one. 

If you are working towards your goal, make sure you set new goals when you achieve them. Paying off debt is fantastic, but keep the momentum going and avoid the same pitfalls that may have brought you there in the first place.

I hope this helps someone out there and encourages those that might be in the same cycle I have been in!

Living below the poverty level is hard, but I feel really blessed in some ways, so I wanted to share some things I'm thankful for and let some of you share yours.

1. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - even though the government keeps trying to take these life-saving programs away from us, they haven't yet. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have the blessing of these programs to enable me to have a place to live and health care. 
2. SNAP - Even though I don't eat like a queen, I eat well, and being on SNAP has made me much more conscious of how I spend my food dollars. I don't eat as much junk food, and I'm the queen of stretching a small amount of meat and veggies into a 3-day meal that is also healthy. Knowing that no matter what, I'm going to have food every month is such a blessing to me.
3. My apartment - When I was looking for a new place to live, I thought I'd never find anything I could afford. I can't even remember how I found this place, but I'm so happy I did. Not only do I have a really nice apartment for the money, but there is a courtyard and space outside where I'm allowed to garden. Management is awesome, and my rent only goes up about $10 a year. This place has been such a blessing!
4. My health - while I'm older and have a few health issues, I'm still able to do most things for myself and be independent. Without a car, I walk to a lot of places and really enjoy it. I'm still able to enjoy my gardening, although on a much smaller scale. My lupus is now ""inactive,"" so I must be doing something right.
5. Giving people - I've gotten so much help from loving, giving people. They've given me everything from clothes, food, and furniture to free plants for my garden. I owe so much to the generosity of others. It's truly a blessing.
6. Reddit - I have met so many wonderful, caring, loving people on Reddit; people who are willing to give of what little they have to help other people in need. I know most of the people on here are Millenials, and it gives this old lady so much hope for the future to know that so many of you are so caring. Blessings to each and every one of you.

I‚Äôd worked and saved up a ton in high school, and my grandpa gave me my relatively small inheritance fund to help me pay for school (my brother used his to pay for his wedding).

Basically, in January of this year, my mom passed away. We aren't 100% sure what she died from but my dad thinks it was an aneurysm. I was 16 at the time. I don't know exactly how much but I do know my dad went into a lot of debt for my mom. I know right now he still owes over 10 grand to the funeral home and is pretty much never home because he's always working over time or on holidays. He worked thanksgiving day and has already told me he's working christmas eve and christmas day for the pay. 
The big problem is he's not paying our bills. We've had our lights shut off once already and he rarely buys groceries. Last night he told me he can't evem afford to buy me winter clothes because the funeral home is apparently calling him and demanding he pay more on his payments. But he refuses to let me get a job and even though I have my license, he won't let me drive my moms car. Ot has been sitting in our yard since she died and its just collecting dust but every time I bring it up, he yells at me and tells me I cant touch it.

I don't know how to help him, or me.  I need a new bra because the one I have now the underwire is constantly poking me .. All of my underwear has period blood stains and are at least 3 years old because my dad is too ""squicked out"" to buy me underwear.  I need long sleeve shirts and an actual winter jacket. I'm still wearing short sleeves and just layering them so I have enough to wear. It just sucks right now

I'm just not sure what to do for him. It seems like every time we talk, he gets upset and just ends up either yelling at me or shutting down and leaving in the middle of the conversation to lock himself in his room. I know he misses mom. I miss my mom too. She made everything better but right now I just want my dad back too. So if anyone has any idea on how I can help him please let me know. Thanks

671,9t2535,False,None,164,Some tips from a former bank employee on fees,povertyfinance,"Hi everyone. I really qualify as ""poverty finance"" level myself so I'm not trying to come in here and preach. It's just that I noticed a lot of common 'mistakes' or things people in our situation could be doing to avoid problems and fees at the bank.

1. Read your account disclosure. You know that booklet of tiny text that you got when you opened your account? I know some people view it as 'just another legal thing that is hard to understand' but they are usually written pretty simply if you actually read it. **You can skip to the part that talks about your specific account type.** You don't need to read the whole thing, but do read it in order to know how your account works.

2. Do not sign up for automatic payments. I've seen this go wrong far more often than it has actually helped anyone. They are nearly always impossible to cancel at the last moment if you are close to overdrawing your account. If you do use them, make **DAMN** sure you put them on a calendar with alerts and stay aware of what is coming up for the next pay cycle.

3. Do not habitually overdraft. Almost anything is better than overdrawing your account. Even credit card interest is FAR less than an overdraft fee. If you do the math, that $25 or whatever per charge is worse than a payday loan in almost all cases. I've seen people who had over 300 overdrafts in the last year. At $25 each, that is giving the bank thousands of dollars of free money. There's always a better way than doing that, but it's not like the bank is going to call you up and volunteer that information. You have to ask for help if you *are* in that situation.

4. Understand the posting order of your account. Charges don't always come out in the order in which they occurred in real time. Please talk to a bank associate if you don't understand this by reading your account disclosure and they would be happy to explain it, as it works differently at every bank. But at the bank I worked for, ACH (direct debits) would come out before debit card transactions. So let's say you had $600 in the bank. A $599 direct deposit came out for your rent. Then you did 6 debit card transactions for $2-5 each. You would actually get charged 6 overdraft fees even though you barely went over. There are a lot of situations where our posting order *helped* customers, but also situations where it royally screwed them over.

5. **Free checking accounts still exist.** You are getting ripped off if you're being charged every month just to have your checking account open. Period. Look into local banks and **ask** for the free option. They're not always advertised. And if they don't have one, go somewhere else.

6. Understand how ""opting out"" of overdraft fees works. Federal law requires banks to allow you to opt out of getting fees for most debit card purchases. However, you can still get fees for ACH (direct debits that I warned against earlier), checks, and **subscription services**. Yes, that $7 netflix subscription can cause a $25 overdraft fee even if you opt out.

7. If you do get an overdraft fee for something stupid, feel free to call and explain the situation. However, know that customer service reps are required to *justify* each refund if asked by a supervisor. If they just give you the refund despite the fact that you've overdrawn your account 10 times in the last year, they could *lose their jobs*. So cut them some slack. 

8. Do not rely only on online banking. It sounds oldschool, but keeping a checkbook register is the most reliable way to avoid overdraft fees. Online banking has no way of knowing if you have a check outstanding, for instance. It also has no way of knowing that you added a tip to a restaurant bill until the restaurant processes it. I've seen many people become overdrawn because of this.

I hope some of these tips help. It killed me to see people lose so much money on fees.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9t2535/some_tips_from_a_former_bank_employee_on_fees/,1629,"9. Don't bank at a national or international bank.

10. Don't be afraid to change banks if you feel they are being predtory or even just unhelpful.

677,f2r4zq,False,None,179,"Ex-employer refusing my w-2 as ""punishment"" for quiting",povertyfinance,"As the title says. Worked for a(nother) Subway for most of last year. They constantly would leave me to close the store alone, which was located in a high crime area of [major city]. It was more than a few times that either the place was robbed, or there was someone suspicious hanging around trying to catch me when I left the place after closing. I once had someone try to follow me from the store, presumably because they were too dumb to understand than I'm not a manager and don't have any money for them to to steal. Had to cut through a couple of dark alleys and someone's backyard in order to ditch then before heading down my own street and to my building.

Would normally have to work 12pm-10pm. They'd have someone else work with me 2pm-8pm. Of course, before I took the job, I specifically asked if they world have a minimum of 2 people on until closer, which I was assured they would. LMFAO, right. That was the first thing to not happen. Then, the night time person (younger sister of the manager, who in turn was the wife of the owner of all the local Subways) would leave at 7pm. Then 6pm. Then world not show up until 3om. Then 4pm. I think you're seeing how this is going. So, SO many times I complained that I didn't want to get shot by dinner scumbag so they could rob my empty wallet. Oh, and you'll live this, they demanded that I absolutely not call the cops if/when the place gets robbed. Why? Who knows.

Anyway, I finally got fed up. One day, when it was particularly slammed, with me by myself, customers yelling at me, threatening me, etc, it came to about 5:30pm with no one showing up. A customer starts yelling at me about shit in the floor. Not trash, not food; literal shit. Human feces. Some guy went into the bathroom, threw shit everywhere, smeared it all over the toilet, on the walls, stomped it all over the floor, ask over the door and door handle, and then tracked it all over the floor through the restaurant. I said fuck it, got a chair and sat down behind the counter and tried to serve anyone else. Didn't take 5 minutes before I got a call saying they could see me on the cameras and wtf am I doing, etc. Another 10 minutes, and the manager magically asked up, her sister (who should have been there hours ago) in tow. I said nothing. I stood up, I walked out.

Fast forward to now. First week of February, I'm waiting on my w-2. I normally have my taxes ready to go, ready to be e-filed the day the IRS starts accepting returns. No w2 is showing up. Got 3 others weeks ago, from the other places I worked. I really, REALLY didn't want to have to contact these people, but what choice did I have, I want my damn refund. Call them up, ask when I can expect a w2. The answer? Never. They're not going to send me my w2. Apparently they have no intention of sending it because I ""treated then poorly"" and ""dunt deserve a payment"" or some bullshit. IDK, it's not easy understanding wtf this guy is saying with his Indian accent over his shitty quality phone line. But I figure it's pretty clear what the intention is.

So of course I had to use a 4852, which means I have to file by mail. Which in turn means I have to take time away from sleeping (I now work 3rd shift) to walk in the rain to staples in order to print out my returns, and the 4852s, and manner copies of paystubs. Then figure out how the hell that's all supposed to go together, waste more time and energy going back and forth, then to a post office to mail the damn things.  Not to mention the fact that I world have gotten my refunds in a couple of weeks, bit instead it will take who the hell knows how long. Blah blah blah.

And of course, there will no consequences for this guy, because of course not. This is someone who passes health inspections with cash payments. 

Well, that's my rant. My completely useless, unnecessary rant. Maybe when I get out of work tomorrow morning I'll have a new post, with actual descriptions of things that need to actually get done, and a request for actual advice on how to do it. You'll love that one, as it's about how to get a apartment when apartments cost twice your monthly wages and the people renting out the apartments want you to make per month, 4-5 times the rent they are charging.


Edit*  So just added info. As I've mentioned, I've already sent my tax return by mail, so I honestly don't care at this point whether I actually get the w-2 or not. If I get one eventually, and the numbers differ from what I reported on the 4852, I'll file an amended return. I've already been through this whole process a few years ago, for yet another Subway of all places that never provided a w-2. For that one, I went to work one afternoon only to find the store closed and locked. The owner wouldn't answer his phone, and that was just... that. The store never opened again and I never heard from the guy. Never even got my last paystub. I had to use my paystub from the week before, plus the direct deposit amount of my last check (so my net pay), then take that use that info and the payroll calculator on the ADP website to reverse engineer the gross pay and then the tax deduction that would have appeared on my last pay stub. Used that info to file, and yes, reported the missing w-2 to the IRS. I eventually received a w-2 in the mail, in friggin June. Had to file an amended return and ended up getting an extra $20 or so refund.

As for calling this person or that department, and report here there and everywhere: honestly, that's not going to happen. I have pretty severe social anxiety, among other things, and will go to great lengths to NOT make phone calls, or be put into situations where I have to deal with people. Just posting in public forums like reddit is honestly terrifying an fairly stressful(though yes, I do it anyway, as a mild form of attempted self-treatment, as and when I can manage. Better than many of the alternatives). On top of that, c'mon. My post was about working for Subway. It should be pretty obvious I'm dirt poor and have much more immediate things to worry about than how to get old employers in trouble. It's been 5 or 6 months since I've worked there. I've had a number a much worse things happen in the last 6 months that I've had to deal with, I just can't be bothered dedicating any more mental energy to Subway, beyond writing up a quick post just to rant about all the BS. 

So yeah, this was just a rant. A way to vent. And by the look of the comments, I'm certainly not the only one.

I still have other debts to focus on, but having one out of the way helps me stay motivated to keep going!  I've been trying to focus on reducing my debt for about two years now.  Until recently, I simply wasn't making enough money to really make any progress toward my goals.  I was taking a ton of credits in school and paying for that out of pocket and, because of my school schedule, I was working a crappy job with flexible hours but garbage pay.  I started selling as much random old stuff as I could on eBay to make some extra cash.  Then traded in my car for a cheaper, more efficient car.  I found a better job, closer to home, with better pay.  I have also chosen to ride my bike to work a LOT (about 8 miles one-way), but it's getting incredibly cold/windy/rainy where I live so I might take a few months off of that!!

Glad I had started saving for an Emergency Fund,povertyfinance,"After a couple years of being chronically underemployed (lived in a van for part of it) I got a new job with ok pay and quite a bit of available overtime. I've been taking advantage of the overtime and got caught up in all my bills. Then I saved up $1,000 for an emergency fund a l√† Dave Ramsey.

After that I've been putting anything extra into paying off credit cards (first one was 29%!). 

About a month ago I had a dream. It's a common stress dream, so normally, I wouldn't think too much of it. I'm not into astrology, or dream interpretations, horoscopes, etc. I don't look at dreams real closely for ""interpretations"" etc. But this one was just really unsettling to me, and I distinctly felt that I needed to stop paying down debt and start saving instead. 

So for the past month I've been socking away the OT money.

Today I found out my company's contract is getting bought out by another company. 

There's a pretty high chance I will be rolled over into the new company, but I can't tell you how nice it feels to know I have at least a full months expenses taken care of.

I had an actual panic attack when I opened them and saw balances that totaled $14k and change. It made no sense because I‚Äôm fully insured with Highmark BCBS, the best high premium plan that my company offers, as I have a chronic illness. I basically had a breakdown and realized that the next 3 years of my income were a wash, and my plans to build a savings were over.

I‚Äôve been calling Blue Cross, the hospital billing departments, over and over for 3 months. I had to comb over the Explanation of Benefits and coding on each charge. I asked BCBS to reprocess each, called the providers to confirm their coding was correct. I had to write and send two letters USPS for appeals.  On Friday, the billing department at one told me, like no big deal, ‚ÄúOh yeah, you don‚Äôt owe anything. Blue Cross didn‚Äôt accept the coding. We sent your bills to local when they should have gone to your out of state insurance. They reprocessed, and you‚Äôre all set.‚Äù No notification from insurance, no letters in the mail yet. 

I still have to call the other hospital and confirm that they‚Äô also have a 0 balance. But finally, after months of stress and trying to make a second job work, I can stop worrying and get back to my financial plan.

694,hr0cxn,False,Success/Cheers,151,I made it out of poverty.,povertyfinance,"Not to say I don't still struggle with certain things, poverty spend mindset is a killer. But I've never missed a rent payment, I have always been able to pay my bills and buy clothes and food. Some months I'd have nothing left over from spending superfluously. But I wasn't in poverty anymore.

I have had to deal with my personal monetary issues and learn the value of money because no one told me when I was young.

When I was a kid, my mom got 800 dollars from social security, 400 in ebt and 400 dollars a month.She was a raging drug addict and it got worse the older I got so she would end up spending all of her money on drugs and sell her food stamps for 70 cents on the dollar. She was abusive and to top it off the rest of our family was rich. It was just her. We lived in a shitty trailer park.I remember understanding that I was different from the rest of my classmates, I would show up to school in clothes that didn't fit and were full of holes because they were hand-me-downs and all the kids would make fun of me and tell me I smelled like cigarette smoke constantly.

A lot of the time school lunches were the only meal I was getting. My elementary school would give me bags of clothes, coats for winter and stuff like that, I didn't realize for a while that this wasn't something normal.I couldn't go on class trips, sometimes my mom would be too konked out to sign the waivers or we didn't have enough money.I was truant in school because I was worried my mom was going to die, so I would ditch.

Everyone could see that something was wrong.My mom got cps called on her 5-6 times growing up, she would teach us what to say and said that if we told the truth, we would go in foster care and get molested. So we lied and said everything was fine. I hate that I didn't say anything. But I was scared.On my 10th birthday, my mom got so mad at me that she threw pots and pans at my head.I hate my family for never helping. I hate my family so much. I hate them for being rich and entitled and letting us suffer all the while talking shit about us.

But I made it, when I was 16, my mom and I got in a huge fight. She wanted to smash my xbox because I never left my room and I told her that the xbox was a better mother than she would ever be. She called my sister and told her to take me. Thank god.I then spent time living with my sister then moved out when I was 18.

It's been a bit rocky, I have cptsd, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder so that makes it harder on me. But recently I got an amazing job opportunity, it's QA testing for a big game company, it ain't fancy but it pays really well. I live with my fiance and we just got an apartment together.

It's gonna be a battle but after big important purchases, like a new bed and stuff. I'm going to boost my savings and save for a trip to japan with him.

I made it out, you guys can too.If you have any specific questions or want advice if your situation is or was similar, I will help. I learned a lot of wisdom and I think I have advice to give, may not be the best advice, but maybe I can help.

Thank you.

Also I still have that xbox to this day. Still a better mother than she was.

695,b9pmfv,False,None,193,(19F) Taking on the responsibility of a child soon,povertyfinance,"[KY, USA] Due to reasons no fault of my own, my parent is going to be incarcerated soon. That leaves responsibility of my sibling (6F) to me. I have enrolled and am on the waiting list for CNA classes, so should be getting paid anywhere from $9-11 an hour. I'm already looking into low-income housing, utility help, and general help from the government. I just think I'd ask here for any advice regarding how to budget my finances.

Things to consider:

Lowest rent I've found is $595 2bed 1ba for low-income housing with water, sewer, and trash included. I should qualify for low-income assistance.

I have a car and my insurance is $100 a month. I have student loans that are $50 a month. My car is not working now and I have it quoted around $500-600 to get it fixed. However, I'm willing to walk to work and save up money to get it fixed. 

Need advice on how to parent. I have raised two other siblings although not to this degree of care. Is there any after school programs I could look into? How can I be the best provider for my sibling?

For those wondering about any relatives should could go to, both likely candidates live out of state. I also do want to keep her close, even if means sacrificing years to raise her. Any advice helps. 

EDIT: I am honestly in disbelief of the kindness that people still have for one another. I have had offers of help from many sweet people. You all are so beautiful. It has really touched my heart and I have to admit, I have teared up reading all of y'alls comments. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

But I've been broke and in a natural disaster before. Here's where I put my $40 remaining cash this week to prep for everything shutting down....

There was no toilet paper. I cannot afford a bidet.

So I got a bathroom sink-to-hose adapter from Lowes. It was $6.50. The hose was 99 cents from the 99 cent store. $7.49 and my bum will stay clean! The toilet is next to my sink in the bathroom, so it's no big to turn it on, DIY-bidet then wipe down with a washcloth. I will not be returning to toilet paper after this.

Which brings me to my other investment... $5 of ugly printed terrycloth from the fabric store. I've cut it into 30 butt-only-wipes. I haven't sewn it. Use pinking scissors and there won't be stray threads. Wash and reuse them whenever you want.

I also bought 10 pounds of flour for $8. I have plenty of seasonings, yeasts, everything else for bread.

I was gifted a case of wine from a now-cancelled work banquet. Big come up there! 

Finally, I bought $10 worth of ugly fruit from a farmers market. I'm redditing while slicing up about 30 pounds of misshapen, delicious fruit to stick in my dehydrator (purchased at goodwill for $5).

Planet fitness is my personal favorite because they‚Äôre often 24/7 so you can do this at times with lower traffic and they also serve pizza and bagels at times. 

Also: if you‚Äôre struggling with finding a job and need one immediately, look into pizzerias or local family owned businesses. A lot of them pay under the table, have a high turnover rate so they‚Äôre likely looking for people, don‚Äôt have the long and drawn out hiring processes and you‚Äôre more likely to talk directly to the owner. 



Edit: wow everyone, I was not expecting this much feedback but I‚Äôm glad other people have used this tip as well. Granted, it depends on where you are and how the gyms in your area function but a little research and calling can go a long way to make sure you at least have a place to shower. 

Edit 2: as someone mentioned (thank you for that) just because the place pays under the table, it does not mean you shouldn‚Äôt pay taxes.

I'm decluttering, and in one box I found a bunch of fabric, including half a roll of muslin I had forgotten I had.

I don‚Äôt think most people would consider the amount of money I received to be \*that\* much money. But it shook me a little.

Suddenly, with the snap of the government‚Äôs fingers, I was able to make a twelve year old debt disappear so I could get the piece of paper that proves I did in fact earn the bachelors degree I should have gotten when my now teenage son was a toddler.

Suddenly, I was able to repay two months‚Äô rent on an empty apartment to the predatory property management company Premier. A company who makes a fucking killing exploiting tax breaks for providing ‚Äúlow income housing‚Äù that is substandard and still far too expensive for many of its residents. A company that regularly overworks and undertrains it‚Äôs property managers so empty apartments sit open and they get to extract profit from the most vulnerable in our communities instead of paying their workers to do the job needed swiftly and fill the damn apartment.

Suddenly I had the back up I needed to look at my credit report and call about an unknown $644 medical debt. To call my health insurance and see if they could help bring that down. To navigate the fucking labyrinth of people I needed to tell my story to in order to get the basic fucking information about how this debt was created.

Guys. I am EXHAUSTED.

I know that it‚Äôs controversial to say that when Black and POC folks are being literally fucking trampled. I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy. I will be ok. I just had to fucking write something just in case any of you find yourselves, like I did yesterday, just fucking drained after a day of phone calls that felt like whack-a-mole. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I felt like I‚Äôd just been put through the fucking wringer but I think I know now.

Doing the work to repair one‚Äôs credit can be painful and difficult. It can be so hard that it is re-traumatizing. Living in poverty is trauma. Dealing with institutions that systematically make you feel less than and actively separate you from the resources you need to survive and thrive is traumatic.

A LOT of people are struggling financially because of the pandemic, but some of us have suddenly gotten enough money to make a dent in what was previously a hopeless cause ‚Äî our financial well being. It was something so profoundly out of reach that we simply put it out of our minds. No amount of budgeting or sacrificing or side hustling was going to make the money we needed appear because that‚Äôs not how poverty works. You are so deep in the hole that getting out of the hole isnt even a coherent thought that makes sense. You‚Äôre just trying to keep the dirt from completely enveloping you. You‚Äôre just trying to keep breathing.

PLEASE ‚Äî my internet stranger friends who are doing the hard work of requesting your credit report, of calling these collection agencies, of remembering the circumstances around why you couldn‚Äôt pay, of re-living the shame around not having enough money to protect your future self from debt ‚Äî UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO KEEP POOR FOLKS DOWN ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN A LIFETIME OF MISTAKES ANY ONE PERSON CAN MAKE.

There is nothing wrong with YOU because you do not have enough money to provide for yourself, your family, and keep some aside for emergencies.

I of course understand that there are exceptions ‚Äî some people do squander their resources. But the vast majority of us poor folk try incredibly hard to live on an absolutely TINY amount of money. We sacrifice everything we can and then go deeper and sacrifice things we can‚Äôt. We have learned to put a wall between our own sweet, vulnerable selves and the SHAME of not being able to pay an important bill. We forget about it because we HAVE TO. We throw away the multi-colored 2nd and 3rd and 4th notices because we have NO OTHER CHOICE. We hang up on bill collectors because we literally do not have $10/month with which to bargain.

If you find yourself suddenly in a position to do the hard work of paying these companies that have fucked you over, or overcharged you, or that you don‚Äôt even fucking remember why you owe them money any more, and you find yourself overwhelmed, or anxious or confused and you can‚Äôt quite understand why you‚Äôre having such a large reaction to ‚Äújust‚Äù paying a bill... I beg you, be gentle with yourself. Being poor is scary. It is stressful and painful and difficult. You are strong and brave and WORTHY of having ENOUGH.

We are not here on this planet to feel BAD about circumstances beyond our control. Pay those debts, and hold yourself gently while you do it. Take a day off between debts. Allow yourself time to decompress and grieve for an economic and legal structure that incentivizes those with money and penalizes those without. You didn‚Äôt create it and it‚Äôs not your fault that you are at its mercy. I see you. I‚Äôm here. If you need support, please reach out. You are more than your fucking credit score.

I get that you're frustrated and have some real problems, but there are no structures in place keeping poor people down. none. 

if there were structures in place keeping poor people down, then Oprah Winfrey would still be living in poverty in Mississippi and Starbucks founder Howard Schultz would still be living in subsidized housing in Brooklyn and George Soros would still be living broke in Hungary after the Nazis destroyed his nation and Peter Lynch, one of the most successful investors in history, would still be living poor in Boston where the family barely scraped by after his father's death. 

only about 4% of Americans stay in the bottom 20% of earners for their entire adult lives. a majority of Americans are in the bottom 20% and the top 20%, only at different times in their lives. See Economic Facts and Fallacies by Thomas Sowell, a black economist. Over half of Americans are in the top 10% by income at some point in their lives, see Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Immigrants to America, who often face major language and cultural barriers, are about 4x more likely to become millionaires than native-born Americans.

I've never been able to save more than $100. Anytime an automatic transfer was made to my savings account, I would transfer it back. I also have Wells Fargo, so anytime I purchase something, a dollar gets transferred to savings - only to be put back into checking.

By doing this, it prevented me from logging in and transferring money easily back to checking. If I really needed it,  I could go to the bank and make the transfer. 

Lo and behold, I learned to budget without the extra money and haven't touched a penny in my savings. Today I went to the bank and realized I now have over $500 saved. It feels so good and so surreal. I also feel *relief*.

I called them more than once and they refused to give me a better deal, so I opened up a new 0% APR on balance transfers with a different company and made myself a payment plan to pay it down.

742,c4af6j,False,None,205,I'm paying thousands for dental work now because I delayed getting something basic fixed.,povertyfinance,"I fucked up.

I see a lot of posts about medical costs on here and I just want this story to serve as a reminder to all medical related issues: if you ignore it now, it will cost you later. This happened to my teeth, aka my 'optional bones' according my insurer. I had to get a root canal done because it got infected. I had a very slight lingering pain but 4 days later it hadn't gone away. I was concerned enough to see a dentist asap, and they confirmed a hole in my tooth was heavily infected and a root canal was needed asap. I asked for a quote first. The dentist happily ran the numbers: $250 plus $25 copay. I would also need antibiotics. I decided to put it on my credit card and pay it off with the next paycheck because I didn't want to delay it; infections are serious. Don't fuck with them. I once ignored a fever for a few hours and wound up in the ICU for 6 days.

So I got the root canal done and quite a significant amount of tooth had to be sheered off. It wasn't a fun recovery, but the antibiotics cleared it up and after the swelling went down, I now had a functional - though slightly stubby and short - tooth left over. 

I was told I would need a crown too, to make up for the missing tooth mass, and because they had really drilled deep in there: teeth aren't so strong when they're hollowed out. I asked her to run the numbers again. This time, my insurer denied it. I would be paying 100% out of pocket because I had hit my cap for THE WHOLE YEAR. It would cost $2000. I said no. The tooth had recovered well and I would be losing about 5 months worth of savings for something my insurer declared was purely cosmetic. The dentist warned me against opting out, but I said I'd have to come back later when I can afford it. Honestly, I was willing to wait until January 1st for my insurance to roll over, since it would cut the cost of any work down by half.

Today, two months after my root canal, I was enjoying some slightly refrigerated chocolate and heard a ""crunch"". I spat out what I was chewing on and searched the mess for what I initially thought was a giant grain of salt. Nope, it was a full one-quarter of my damaged tooth. I washed my mouth out and see the gap that's now glaring at me in the mirror. 

The cost of restoration + sealant + moulding + crown + x-rays + whatever, it's going to be far more than if I had just sucked it up in the beginning. Emergency savings are meant for emergencies, but I was convinced by my lack of insurance coverage that a crown was purely optional, just restoring the cosmetic shape of my original tooth. I also assumed the dentist was just trying to con more money out of me with unnecessary add-ons. Welp, I was wrong. And now I feel bad too because my dentist is absolutely lovely and I've just been mentally tainted by the whole US health system (as an Aussie).

It would honestly be cheaper to fly home and get dental work done, and I am returning to Aus in August, but I am not fucking with this again. I found a teaching dental school in my city that quoted me about 800-1200 for a single tooth of work. It's still such an enormous chunk of my savings but I told them fuck yeah get me in asap. I'm not making this dumb mistake again.

Don't ignore small medical issues, they snowball into big medical problems very quickly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/c4af6j/im_paying_thousands_for_dental_work_now_because_i/,1418,"This is a story so familiar to us in the dental field. Do not take short cuts with diagnosed treatment. If you feel like you don‚Äôt trust your dentist, ask for a copy of your X-ray and get a second or third opinion. Also there‚Äôs no shame in telling them you can‚Äôt afford treatment. The doctor can prioritize and work with insurance. 
On a side note‚Äî‚ÄîI‚Äôm so tired of insurance companies. They always deny basic services or drag their feet paying. We had an insurance company preauthorize some treatment because the patient was tight on money and he could only take care of the worst teeth. They sent it back approved. We did all the work and did some for free because Doc is awesome and once she had access to the area she couldn‚Äôt leave the glaring crud on the tooth next door. Anyway they denied the claim (they had no record of the preauth despite us sending them a copy) again and again and again for 24 months. Each time we were having to resubmit X-rays, chart notes, and perio charting.  Thank goodness they were all meticulous and the patient kept calling them as well. 
So if your office doesn‚Äôt fight to get your claim paid, you can keep trying. Insurance companies are contracted with you and if you‚Äôre paying for benefits you deserve to get them.

My parents only wanted me to go to nursing school- some job appropriate for young ladies. Gag.

December 2018 I decided I was going to change everything. I studied my butt off, passed 36 CLEP credits. Enrolled in the BS in accounting program at WGU. Finished it in one 6 month term. Went right into the MAcc program, finished that in one term. Passed my final class last weekend.

Went from no degree to a graduate degree in one year of college and 4 months of CLEP.

As of this upcoming Friday I only have one account left in collections! It‚Äôs strange to say but the CARES act is allowing me to repair my credit so I can buy a house in the next couple years! 

I can‚Äôt really tell anyone in my family because they‚Äôre upset that I‚Äôll be buying a house over 2000 miles away from them, and they‚Äôd take it as me rubbing it in their faces. My parents never taught me how to budget or live within my means. My dad taught me not to bother saving money because it will just get stolen (he emptied my savings account to pay off his chain of payday loans - he‚Äôd been taking one out to pay the last and apparently considered my money to be up for grabs). 

It feels shitty but also great to be able to say that as of right now, I am better than them. I‚Äôm better because I will be a better parent and I will teach my children from a young age how to earn and manage money. I‚Äôm better because I won‚Äôt steal from my kids. I‚Äôm better because I live within my means and am open and honest with my new husband about money and finances. 

The best thing they taught me is what not to do, and I will always be grateful for that lesson. Now to get that last $1800 paid off!

Edit: I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm an asshole for the part where I said I‚Äôm better than them. It wasn‚Äôt meant to be a superiority complex thing. It‚Äôs a declaration that I‚Äôm choosing to do things better, for myself and my future children. My parents were children in the 70‚Äôs. They were adults in the very late 80‚Äôs. They know how to budget and pay bills. They CHOOSE not to live within their means. To this day my dad won‚Äôt discuss finances with my mom or even let her see if there‚Äôs any money saved up for emergencies (and he‚Äôs the compulsive spender, not her). To this day they have nothing saved for retirement save for a tiny pension my mom will get from a job she worked at years before they met. They don‚Äôt have a 401k even though my dad worked for the same company for over 20 years, because he kept deciding to pull money out of it to go on vacations. 

So if you want to call me an asshole? Fine.

Nope. We sure didn't. We had books on the topic. We had libraries.

You can say you're smarter than them - that's fine. But to make a moral judgement ""I'm better than them"" - that's such a  teenager thing to say.

**As for payday loans - have you ever read about them and their predatory ways?** Have you read how many poor people got sucked into them because they had no where else to turn?

Then stop being mean to all the people who have fallen for them. What else did they have?! Where else could they turn?!

Your boast is like those people who say, ""Well I don't know how these young people could pay $50,000 for a college degree. They must be STUPID.""

No - they are not necessarily stupid. Maybe they were just ignorant? The college industry did HEAVY marketing about how it was the Yellow Brick Road to the middle class - no matter what your career choice. Colleges advertise LIKE MAD and people fell for it, especially in the Great Recession.  So many careers now require a degree, often a graduate degree, so what choice do people have but to go to college if they don't want to start their own business?

Nevertheless, observers MOCK them for falling for the student loan trap - as if there is really any other way for at least 75% of Americans.

That's how you sound to me - like you are mocking your family.

**Do not chop off the heads of others to make yourself taller. We might be at the start of a major recession now and if that happens, then all the young will learn ANEW why their parents and grandparents lost their homes & life savings.**

I'm sorry if your parents stole from you. I really am. But someday call them up and ask them how much they earn today. Then ask about all their monthly expenses. Sit down and make a budget for THEM and then you will understand why they are struggling.

**I also suggest you ask them how much they earned when you were 5, 10 and 15.** Find some ""in today's dollars"" calculators online and then you will see just how very poor they were.

Listen, if they were truly criminals, I'm not defending them. Not at all. But if they were crappy money managers because they sure didn't have any modeling for that from THEIR parents, then maybe it's your turn TO BECOME THE TEACHER OF YOUR PARENTS?

Edit: thanks for the comments so far but I think the original point of the post has gotten overlooked. Minimum wage in my state (NC) is $7.25 an hour.

It finally dawned on me it doesn't have to be an all or nothing thing - I don't have to use their dryer. The machine does a great job wringing things out - they're almost dry out of the washer.

769,8z25qe,False,None,212,"Selling plasma probably won't pay your bills, but it keeps food on the table and gas in your tank.",povertyfinance,"I've been selling plasma on and off for over a year. It's not glamorous and I'm not too happy about the mark on my arm, but it has kept my family fed and able to continue going to work/school. 

Many plasma centers have onsite daycare during at least part of their open hours (I know BioLife does at most locations), and donations typically range from 45 minutes to an hour (second donation onward - the first donation is long because of physicals, questionnaires, getting your profile set up, etc). 

Plasma donation definitely isn't for everyone, and it certainly hasn't boosted me out of poverty, but it helps me feel more secure knowing that even when my bank account is low, I can net $70 a week for groceries and gas. It's also nice to spend an hour just reading browsing the internet, or playing a game. 


Some tips:

-Drink a lot of water the night before. The donation will go faster, and you'll feel much better.

-Don't eat a huge, fatty meal beforehand. It can stop your donation if your plasma looks too milk-like (excessive fat), and you won't be compensated.

-That being said, do eat a meal with protein an hour or two prior to donation. Your blood protein, iron content, and blood pressure are taken prior to every donation. If your iron or protein is too low or high, you'll be deferred for a day.

-Take advantage of promotions and coupons. Plasma centers often run frequency bonuses each month, and first time donors usually have coupon codes available that will exponentially increase your first month's payout.

-Evenings, weekends, and lunch time will always be peak plasma center traffic hours. There's not much way around this if you work a typical day shift, unfortunately. 

-Recommend plasma donation to people; most places have referral bonuses. Offer to split the bonus if it helps get someone in the door, if you want.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8z25qe/selling_plasma_probably_wont_pay_your_bills_but/,1299,"I'm not going to upvote this because I'd rather see people get gig jobs than sell plasma.

770,9tfedg,False,None,101,Super in-depth write-up on how I pull in an extra grand a month working online. Hope it helps with the holidays!,povertyfinance,"Hey everyone. This is an all-inclusive write-up compiling all of my past posts on how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through pretty simple online work. I figured with the holidays coming up, we could all use the extra cash. I am posting again because this is a full-blown compilation of everything, and I am sure there are some people that haven't seen it. Plus, I am including updated numbers from my last post, and a link to the guide I put together with even more stuff (like passive earning, saving money with apps, teaching Chinese kids English, and a lot more).
___
As stated, I put all of this info into an e-book, plus a TON of other stuff that was either written by me, or compiled from others (with their permission). I am attaching a paid and free link. If you're interested in paying for it (much appreciated if you do!), it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126) for under $1. Free version is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YiBY-6mYr1tEFa7hbZFdRkQtE2Gu4DHK/view?usp=sharing).
___
Because this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income, I won't pretend you can survive with only this. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. 

As I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will include time requirements to make this money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. 

I personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix. This works better for my temperament and preferences. 

Tech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. 

These are combined numbers over the last year.  Anyway, on to the revenue streams. There are some refs, clearly labeled, as well as non-ref links: 
___
**[Respondent.io ref](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11)** ([$4,300](https://imgur.com/a/oSpkC5o)): Studies - Most countries - This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, easily averaging $125 per test. I only average getting approved for the groups about 10% of the time (I have filled out about 400 screeners and have been selected for 40 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. [Non-ref](https://app.respondent.io)
___
**[Prolific.ac ref](https://www.prolific.ac/p?ref=O8LEJ7R6)** ([$1,575](https://imgur.com/a/jii6GDW)): Surveys - Most coutries - Based in the UK, this is one of my favorites because they pay in Great British Pound (GBP) which is the equivalent to 1.25x USD. Prolific is similar to mturk in that all you do is fill out surveys. Pay is better than mturk, but the availability of surveys is not as great. The initial questionnaire you have to fill out is a bit long taking me about 20 minutes, but ensures you qualify for every survey they show you and will never get disqualified for not meeting the demographic. You have to hit ¬£5 before you can cash out, but you get this after a few days of watching for surveys. Leave it open in a tab and check it throughout the day. I wish I could do this one all day. They pay out in PayPal anytime you request it and have a balance of over ¬£5. [Non-ref](https://www.prolific.ac)
___
**[Mturk](https://www.mturk.com)** ([$3,142](https://imgur.com/a/AhWXpuw)): Small tasks and surveys - US mainly. Confirmed also in Canada, Europe, & Aus. - This is by far the one I spent the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved.
___
**[Secret shopper app ref](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=roberthW77D)** ([$485](https://imgur.com/HfQ7PZw)): In-person store evaluation - US only - This link will take you directly to a sign-up page with my ref code. Feel free to delete it before signing up, if you want. You will be taken to the app store where you can download the actual app on your phone. Essentially, you go to stores near you that are identified in the app and take pictures or videos of specific items. I like this one because I have the ability to make a few extra bucks if I am already out shopping. The pay for this one averages about $15/hr. [Non-ref](https://app.survey.com)
___
**[Usertesting](https://www.usertesting.com)** ([$800](https://imgur.com/a/ab5ptaN)): Website evaluation - US & maybe select others - This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. 
___
**[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com)** ([$305](https://imgur.com/a/bI5TNO4)): T-shirt creation - Worldwide - After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. [25% off ref code for first order over $40](https://www.talkable.com/x/VznBIO). You save $10 or more, and I get a $10 credit if you use this code.
___
**[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com)** ([$190](https://imgur.com/a/SVhmvu5)): Selling goods - Worldwide - Not much explanation needed here. You buy stuff in-person low, and sell online high. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/eBay-Beginner-money-knowledge-inventory-ebook/dp/B07HT4Y9J6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540416148&sr=8-1&keywords=ebay+no+money) is a $1 beginner's guide dedicated to flipping (also mine).
___
**[PlaytestCloud](https://www.playtestcloud.com/signup)** ($190): Video game testing - Many countries - This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen and voice. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal.
___
**[UsabilityHub](https://www.usabilityhub.com)** ([$15](https://imgur.com/a/U4FhJIQ)): App testing - Many countries - This one lets the user take quick one or two minute surveys on your opinion of an app screen. They pay for this averages to about $.10 a minute, so it is nothing spectacular. Just leave it open in another tab and take a quick survey when you hear a new one come available. 
___
**[UserInterviews](https://www.userinterviews.com)** ($50): Studies - US & maybe select others - Similar to Respondent, but with less approval when filling out the demographics for each study.
___
**Reddit subs**($2,300): It is super simple to use Reddit as more than a social media tool or news website. Knowing the right subs to subscribe to, and what to look for, can help you make a few extra hundred bucks  a month. There are a ton that you can find small or medium jobs on, but I am only going to outline the top four that have worked for me.
___
/r/slavelabour: This sub is normally dedicated to doing cheap jobs for people, at cheap rates. I have both had things done for me here, as well as completed a lot of tasks. It may seem daunting at first, with people offering $2 to write an essay (seriously though.. no homework here), but there are gems to be found. Two of my best jobs have been creating meal plans for $60, and [finding the name of a book for $80](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/92k4n0/task_find_one_of_my_favourite_books_80/?ref=share&ref_source=link).
___
/r/WorkOnline: A gold mine of information on different websites to check out, gift card survey opportunities, and other generally helpful tips. I have never made money directly from there, but have gotten tools that have helped make at least a thousand over the last year.
___
/r/signupsforpay: Since slave labour does not allow paying people to sign up for websites, this is where to go to make a few bucks with signups. From connecting your gas and electric information, to signing up with Acorns, I have probably made a grand total of $100 here. Nothing overly special, but $100 is $100.  
___
/r/giftcardexchange: This is one of my favorites, because you can buy and sell all of those gift cards you have/want. Have a $20 gift card from a family member that you will never use? Sell it here for 80-90%. Want to buy Amazon gift cards for less than face value? Get 'em here. I do a lot of buying on Amazon, so this sub has easily saved me hundreds over the course of using it. Caution: Trade carefully. 
___

I know this is a lot of info and a bunch of it is repetitive from my last post, but I wanted to provide as much info as possible for the compiled post. Well, I hope it helps!

A little backstory: I grew up with immigrants parents, both work minimum wage jobs, and this past May I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. I recently landed my first adult job and will be earning more than both of my parents ever have. 

In my culture, if I don‚Äôt take care of my parents I‚Äôm viewed as a disgrace. I want to support my parents, but I also want to establish a support network for myself so that I can break the cycle of poverty. However, now my parents are constantly asking me for money (rent, bills, home restoration, etc). I don‚Äôt live at home. Although I‚Äôm earning more money than them, it‚Äôs not enough for me to become the literal backbone of the family. How do I establish boundaries without feeling guilty? I want to spoil myself since I‚Äôve never had much to my name but can‚Äôt live with the idea that my parents are slaving away at their minimum wage jobs while I‚Äôm financially independent. For anyone who has been in this situation, what have you done?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/hd8xxu/dealing_with_income_gain_guilt_because_of_my/,1272,"You don't. Your culture may have its prerequisites, but you're in America now. In America, taking care of your parents amounts to shipping them off to a nursing home.

You have respected money, and it has brought you wealth. you should outright block your parents until they're on their knees begging for your forgiveness. that is how things are done in America. ",2020-06-21 15:39:11
776,fsjeut,False,Success/Cheers,130,Rice Beans and Cottage Cheese - Proud to Grow Up in Poverty,povertyfinance,"I have been in an okay situation for the last 2 or so years - not great, I have an okay paying job (for now) and still have student loans and a car loan, but I have emergency savings that will last me a few months. 

I come from a very poor upbringing - a single mother with 3 kids on low income everything. It's a rare moment to be proud of where you come from when you grow up poor. But today I went and picked up groceries for the next 3-4 weeks for my partner and I and spent less than 80$ - but I knew exactly how to do it. It was like being on autopilot. I grew up on rice, beans, and cottage cheese. If we were lucky and my mom got extra tips from waitressing or a new client (personal trainer during the day) we would have chicken or beef, then she would make a stock out of the remains and would make the best tortilla soup. She made everything last, stretched every dollar, and worked her a$$ off. 

Today I realized she taught me survival skills. Growing up poor is really hard in many ways. But it teaches you so many lessons on happiness, and survival, and how to prioritize your dollars when it matters most. For everyone that is going through hard times financially, you definitely are not alone. But if you can learn to live when you're in poverty, you can certainly learn to thrive when you are financially stable - and you WILL see the other side of this! 

Knowing how to cut out all unnecessary items out of your life is a skill that you only learn when you are forced to do it. Right now, I'm okay, but even the looming threat of job loss or furlough is enough to subconsciously enter survival mode. I am perfectly content with my rice, beans, and cottage cheese. It tastes like my childhood, and only costs $0.44 including spices per meal.

Update: Wow! Sorry everyone! I turned off notifications on my phone during the pandemic so I‚Äôm not on it all the time. I‚Äôll be replying to all of you shortly.

Edit: Someone asked what I bought and thought it would be good to share - I eat MOSTLY vegetarian, and my partner is vegetarian so it makes it super easy to scrap meat, which is expensive. Here is what I bought:

Eggs, 60 ct - $9.17 ($1.83/dozen)

Stir Fry Frozen Veggie Mix , 5.5lbs - $9.79 ($1.78/lb)

Onions, 3lbs. - $0.69

Flour tortillas, 2pkgs. - $2.56

Black beans, 10lbs. - $10.41 (1.04$/lb)

Salsa, 2 jars. $3.38

Shredded cheese, 1lb. - $2.88

Rice, 10lbs. - $4.23

Tofu, 4 lbs - $5.39 ($1.34/lb)

Apples, 3lbs. - $3.00

Bananas, - $2.00

Butter, 1lb. - $2.39

Oatmeal, 1 carton, - $2.39

2 pkg rice flakes (drunken noodle noodles) - $4.24

Fish sauce (large size) - $3.89

Brown Sugar, 2lb. - $1.32

Limes, 2lbs - $3.88

Oyster Sauce (lg) - $6.79

Cottage cheese, 2 24 oz - $3.38

Came out to 77.75$ - had a few coupons that applied at checkout that basically waived the tax! to be frank I have a lot of other ingredients at home (for example, soy sauce, salt, spices, pasta, cooking oils, polenta, pasta sauce bought on sale, frozen fruit and meat for me) but this will last us a very long time! I'm sure your Walmart will have a this stuff and priced around the same. I cook a LOT of Asian and Mexican dishes.

To assemble the bowl of wonder in the title, cook rice as you see fit, and simmer beans with some bouillon (cheaper than store bought stock - I use Better than Bouillon No chicken Base, vegetarian gf limits my bone broth roots), an onion (diced), green bell peppers (diced), any spices you desire eor can geet your hands on, and jalapeno. Combine rice beans and cottage cheese in a bowl, put some hot sauce or whatever else you desire, enjoy!

they are both completely free and most software you need is also free. its super easy but really intimidating.  you can try it out with just a usb though without installing anything to see if you like it.

okay so you dont need to erase windows if you end up liking linux. you can have both installed. its called dual booting.  its just picking the right options during install. check a youtube video if you want to see what thats like.

787,h9qazq,False,Budgeting/Saving/Investing/Spending,125,A poverty finance tip that doesn't even require financial literacy: I haven't paid for clothes in two years.,povertyfinance,"I'll admit, this on won't work for everyone. But it will work for *most people*.

Step one: take a deep breath, remember that your value comes from who you are not what you own, and remember that people *like* helping other people. 

Step two: message all of your family and friends, and mention that you would like to offer them a trade: ""Money has been tight recently, I'll take all your clothes to the donation center for you, if you don't mind me looking through them first.""

If your family, friends, and coworkers are anything like mine you'll have quite a few people who buy too many clothes and know they buy too many. These people will watch daytime tv telling them how to clean, gather a bunch of their unwanted items in bags, and then never actually go donate them!

Hell, it's such a common occurrence that even John Mulaney did a bit about it.

Don't think you have to be *exactly* the same size either. You'd be surprised how many ""oversized"" sweaters and ""fat pants"" people will have lying around that they haven't worn in years. And if you're a bit handy, even complete misses can be cut up and made into patches, washrags, or stuffing.

The final part of this tip is the most important, remember: people like helping, and they *love* hearing that they successfully helped.

No matter how many clothes you ended up keeping/getting rid of, send or say a genuine thank you to the person a week or two after.

Mention it was a big help, and how it positively impacted you (reduced stress, helped save for bills that month, got cat's surgery with extra money, etc.) If they're anything like the people I know, they'll be thrilled and offer to do it again sometime.

788,9e5emm,False,None,154,Car Care- Advice from a real mechanic on saving big money,povertyfinance,"Hi everyone! I've been meaning to make this post for a while now. I'm hoping to help everyone save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by taking care of their own vehicle. Once upon a time, long ago, this was the way things were done. Even in old owner's manuals from the 1920's they'd often have a paragraph in the beginning telling the owner [""If something breaks, it's because you neglected basic care and maintenance!!""](https://youtu.be/1XnfX9tTc8c?t=6m45s) Even though Jay Leno is talking about a 1918 Cadillac in that clip, this is still true today. We have lost our ability to take care of cars as they became more complicated, taking longer and longer to have to learn each new piece and computerized part. But it's still very easy! The basics haven't changed much since then.

Us here in r/povertyfinance aren't driving brand new 2019 Diesel trucks or Corvettes. I'd venture to say the average age of the typical redditor's vehicle here is at least 10 years old. You can do most work on most passenger car and trucks with nothing more than a $20 wrench set from Walmart, some pliers, screwdrivers, a hammer, and if you're feeling really fancy a $50 socket set from Autozone. I'm going to go over basic maintenance and repair. Your car may vary! The best resource for information about your specific vehicle or problem that's accessible to you is Youtube. I as a mechanic have a bunch of databases available that are very expensive to access so only shops pay out for it. I also suggest buying the Haynes or Chilton manual for your vehicle, available used on amazon for $2-5. You'll also need a jack, which your car SHOULD have (and if it doesn't, get one!). Don't use the jack that comes with your car by itself to work on your vehicle. You'll need something to support it so it doesn't crush you if\when your jack fails. Many people have died being crushed by their cars, just as many have lost limbs. Autozone has a tool rental service that is ""free"" in the sense that you pay a deposit for the tool and you get said deposit back when you bring the tool back. Even if you're so desperate you can't use a jackstand, put SOMETHING under the car to catch it if it falls.

EDIT6: According to a couple of redditors in the comments, Alldata, Haynes and some automotive repair subscription services are available at public libraries. Public Libraries may also carry repair manuals for some vehciles! Alldata is amazing for finding wiring diagrams, and I'd give it an 8/10 on it's repair procedures. Sometimes it's spot on. Others, especially in cases where there are the same engine but many different options (Looking at you, Chevy...) can leave much to be desired (example: it tells you to take something out, but there's something else in the way that needs to be removed which wasn't listed in the procedure)

EDIT7: How to use Youtube to find your fix. If you need general instructions for basic repairs (Suspension, brakes, oil or other fluid changes, etc) Check out ChrisFix. Easily the best auto repair channel on Youtube that I know of. If you need something specific to your year/make/model of car then you need some Google-Fu. Say I need instructions for how to do the trailing arms on my 1990 Honda Civic hatchback. Many videos will be labeled with the year range for that model (in this case, 1988-1991 or even more specifically 1988-1989 pre facelift, 1990-1991 post facelift). You can try 1991 Civic trailing arms, 1988-1991 Civic Trailing arms, 88-91 civic trailing arms, etc. etc. and get a bunch of different results each time. There are a ton of hobbyists out there who have repair videos made for all kinds of makes and models. I've seen a Ford Model T water pump repair video for f*** sake!! Watch plenty of videos and compare/contrast what's going on in each to gather as much information as possible. These will be great for finding out what part is which, where everything goes, etc because it will look just like your car, beat up and in need of fixing, instead of a flawless factory picture. It's great to have someone get a full screen video of a part and say definitively, ""This is X"" (X being what you're trying to find) ""And X is right here under Y, 3 inches behind Z and you can see it when you stand RIGHT HERE""

To review: You'll need wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, a hammer, a jack and jackstands, the tire iron that came with your car (get one if you don't have it!!), sockets if you can afford it, and other specialty tools as needed for rental from parts stores. 

Parts can be found for cheapest on Rockauto.com (I'm not shilling here, they legitimately have some stupidly low prices- I got the master cylinder, calipers, padsx4 and rotorsx4 for my car for less than $150 1991 Honda Civic). If you can wait and you need a few things, it's hands down the cheapest place for parts. Autozone, Oreilleys, Advance, Napa, etc. All have basically the same prices. Go with one thats close to you that has a good rewards program. Personally I use AZ- 5 $20 purchases gets you $20 credit in store. The junkyard is a decent place for some parts if you have the time to sift through the pick and pull places. If you're desperate, they also sell used tires if that's legal where you live. Inspect them thoroughly, there's plenty of sources out there on how to inspect tires. Not enough space here to give that lesson. Mount and balance services are usually $20-40 for a set of tires from a tire shop.

Now that we've talked about what you'll need, and where to find parts, it's time to talk about diagnosing things. All of your routine maintenance instructions can be found in your manual, on youtube, on forums dedicated to your car, etc. But you need to know how to figure out what to fix. This is the Jedi-like powers that mechanics have where they can get in the car, drive it around the block and instantly know what's wrong. It involves a cause and effect style of thinking where by process of elimination you work from one end of the affected part to the other. For instance, working out where a sound is coming from. When does the sound happen? What are the road conditions, What speed? This also applies to figuring out that pesky Check Engine light/ Service Engine Soon light. 

For those of you who can't follow- A car is made up of several systems. Your Drivetrain (Engine, Transmission, and if you have a RWD or 4WD car, a differential), the Suspension (Shocks, control arms, sway bar and sway bar links, tie rods) Accessories (A/C, Power Steering, Alternator), Brakes and Tires, and the body. You need to first determine the affected system (Engine, suspension, brakes, etc) then determine the cause of the symptom (Vibration, noise, overheating, etc). Each part has a distinctive vibration and sound when it's starting to go bad. Once you know what a bad wheel bearing sounds like you'll be able to hear one from a mile away. Same goes for a bad strut mount, or blown shocks. [Looking at how your tires wear tells you a ton about your suspension](http://www.osceolagarage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tire-wear.png) Again, a ton of this information can be found on Youtube and in your manuals. Diagnosing a No-Start situation is fairly simple. There's a flowchart you can follow. Does the Engine crank at all? Clicking sound? If no crank at all or a loud click, your battery is dead (or your starter is bad). If it cranks and cranks and cranks but doesn't start, you have an issue with the combustion triangle: Fuel, Air, Spark. You're lacking one of the three and you need to figure out which, and why. Lack of fuel is (in order of likelyhood) empty tank, dead pump (or blown pump fuse), clogged fuel filter/rail/injectors, bad fuel. Air is a completely clogged intake filter. Spark is tricky- It depends on how the spark is sent, if there is a distributor or whether the car is coil-over-plug. It could be bad plugs, bad coil(s), bad distributor cap or rotor, bad crankshaft position or engine coolant temperature signal, the list goes on. Fuel and air delivery is simple. Spark really depends on the car.    

I have been learning this stuff for over a decade now, working on my own vehicles as a way to save money before I became a professional mechanic. It can be very scary at first when you take everything apart and have to re-assemble this 2 ton hunk of steel that can go 90mph so that it doesn't fall apart while doing so. Organiziation is key. Having instructions helps a ton. Having pictures of the job before, during and after disassembly can aid greatly in reassembly. If you remove or replace any suspension components because they're worn out like shocks, control arms, etc. take it to an independent shop that does alignments. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO A NATIONAL CHAIN FOR ALIGNMENTS becuase they always always always half-ass their alignments. I am very knowledgeable about how to do full 4-wheel alignments and 9 times out of 10 the national chains like Midas, Brake Check, etc. will just ""Toe and Go"" which is to set the Toe of the car and do nothing else because the toe mostly determines how straight the car will drive. This is incorrect, because they also need to set the camber and caster but are too lazy to do so. So if you have to take it to a chain, TELL them you have replaced major suspension components and want a FULL 4-WHEEL alignment TO INCLUDE CASTER AND CAMBER ADJUSTMENTS and if they tell you that it is not adjustable, make them prove it. Sometimes it really isn't adjustable, most of the time it is, however. The machine will know and it will have a way to pull up the procedure to adjust it if it has a method of adjustment. If it doesn't, it will display that it cannot be adjusted. Alignments and tires are one of the only things that you should have to take your car in for if you do everything right taking care of your vehicle.

The easiest jobs to do yourself are fluid changes, brakes, and some suspension work as well as many gaskets in the vehicle. Some jobs in some cars that are typically easy can be a complete nightmare. Read, read read!! These old vehicles have been taken apart and reassembled by so many people with access to the internet telling others how to do it. Don't get in over your head with a job that's too far outside your ability, because it will end up costing you more when you give up and have to take it to a professional. 

I'll try to add more to this if I can, and reply to any questions if you guys have any (No I won't diagnose your car over the internet. Sorry, not enough time for that and I don't diagnose cars without being right next to them with a scanner in my hands)

EDIT: Some tips on diagnosing things. 

Scenario 1: When you start the car, there's a loud nails-on-chalkboard sound and it persists for some time after starting. Once warmed up it goes away though. Until you start turning the wheel, and putting demand on the power steering pump. So we've determined that A) A sound is coming from the engine bay and B) It happens when the car starts and when we turn the wheel, meaning that we're moving the power steering fluid through the rack and pinion, making the power steering pump have to work. We've already isolated the affected system- Accessories - and identified when it happens, so we've more specifically diagnosed it down to a problem with either the belt driving the pump, or the pump itself. Now that we know what's affected we need to check the condition of the system. Power steering fluid, the belt itself, the pulley, the power steering lines- inspect it all. In this case, the belt looks dry, cracked, and is missing a couple of teeth. A new belt is in order, which can be bought for very cheap and changed in minutes. After installing, the noise went away! And it seemed as though the P/S system was OK- no leaks and the fluid was the proper type and condition (some systems use generic P/S fluid, some use Transmission fluid, some use a proprietary power steering fluid specific to that brand. READ READ READ!!! Using the wrong type of fluid will ruin the entire system, costing thousands of dollars.) 

Scenario 2: Gas mileage seems really bad. The engine feels like it runs rougher than it used to. It takes a really long time to start the car on a cold day, and the exhaust smells like gasoline. There's a check engine light on.

This is where things can get fun. You need to pull the codes that are registered- this could be P0420 (catalytic converter code) Or a bad O2 sensor causing a rich fuel situation, or a vacuum leak, or excessive carbon buildup, or a stuck injector, or a wiring harness issue, or... (you get the picture). Engine diagnosis can be difficult, but with the help of an OBD2 reader and knowledge and understanding of the combustion cycle of the engine, anyone can figure out a basic engine problem. Fuel issues can mean engine management sensors have gone bad (O2, MAF/MAP, etc). Figuring out whether is't a mechanical issue, or an issue with electrical wiring can be challenging.

PRO TIP: ALWAYS ROUTE YOUR WIRES BACK THE WAY THEY WERE WITH ZIPTIES SO THEY DON'T RUB AND CAUSE PROBLEMS LATER ON!!

EDIT2: Stuff to keep in your car for emergency repairs. Again, the tools I listed above (Wrenches, pliers, screwdrivers, basic stuff). A Tire repair kit, NOT A CAN OF FIX A FLAT! FIX A FLAT IS TERRIBLE!! IT RUINS TIRES DON'T USE IT!!!!! Get the kit that has the rubber strips, rubber cement, a big handle with a poker and an awl. [Learn how to use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq3dDoYRlQg) I'd include a gas can just in case you run out, if you can afford to. Get a milk crate or a plastic tub to keep a few things in, to include: A gallon bottle of distilled water (99 cents, good for emergencies when you have a coolant leak and need water), wiper fluid, a quart of oil and quart of ATF, a stick of the epoxy putty that you mold together like mighty putty (RIP Billy Mays) that patches radiators or oil pans in emergencies, a can of brake cleaner to clean stuff with before applying said putty, a funnel, jumper cables, a jackstand, your jack (either the OEM garbage scissor jack your car is supplied with or a better small floor jack). Flares if you feel you may need it, or alternatively an orange safety triangle. That's about everything I'd carry, too much more and you're adding weight that affects mileage.

EDIT3: Stuff to do for older vehicles. If you car is 7 years old or older, you could be looking at replacing quite a bit of rubber components over the next few years. Coolant hoses, gaskets, suspension bushings- all of these tend to last 7-10 years or 100-150K miles which is, surprise, about how long most auto warranties are. I suggest inspecting all of your rubber bits if you haven't done so on your own car, or haven't taken it to the shop in a while. Squeeze the hoses; they shouldn't feel very soft and squishy or alternatively, hard as a rock. **Be gentle with vacuum lines because they like to harden to such a brittleness that they snap just by looking at them funny**. I'd replace all of them if you own a vehicle older than 7 years old and haven't done so. A roll of appropriately sized line is usually very cheap. By the foot from a local parts store is very cheap too, and you have the bonus of being able to bring in the part to match it up and make sure its the size you need.

EDIT4 TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS. Something kind of important another redditor pointed out- How much to tighten something, and how not to strip your bolts and nuts. havingf a torque wrench is great, and using it to torque everything to specified values is even better. But what about those who don't have one? How much do you tigthen things? Here's how to not strip your bolts- Don't tighten it so much that you're struggling to get it even tighter. Yes, you do NOT want that lugnut coming off when you're entering the highway but conversely you want it to come off again sometime in the future. Basically, for critical suspension components and larger bolts (12mm and up) you don't want to use 2 hands on your torquing device; just one. And don't put everything you've got into it either, make it nice and snug and then a bit more. Check it by turning in the loose direction, and if you can't turn it with one hand and and minimal effort it should be plenty tight. For smaller (<12mm) bolts and nuts it should be even less force, decreasing as size does. Keep your threads safe! Don't abuse them! Fixing them can be very time and labor intensive, espeically in hard to reach spots. You can easily sieze up a nut or bolt, requiring heavy duty, expensive tools to break free or having to take it to the shop where they torch/cut the bolt out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9e5emm/car_care_advice_from_a_real_mechanic_on_saving/,1238,"I personally disagree with the comment of never ever take a car to a company chain to get aligned. I work as the lead tech at one of these chains (not one you mentioned) every adjuster installed in a vehicle will be touched if necessary at our shop and also the suggested aftermarket camber arms in the rear for most vehicles that only come with toe adjustment or any other aftermarket parts needed.

I go home, I look at my grocery lists, and sure enough, my top 5 snacks were easily over 80%of my snack spending.  I'm not excessive... but it adds up!

So i learned to make my top 5 snacks. Its stupid cheap! Rice Krispies = dead easy and cheap! Especially since i bought in bulk, stupid cheap.
Nature valley bars: stupid easy to make at home, AND better tasting, and deadly cheap!
Hummus: another stupid easy and cheap one. Under $0.25 for an entire week's worth of the stuff.

Anyway, my grocery tab is down by a lot.

I don't need to learn how to make EVERYTHING. I just learned to make the stuff I'm buying the most and that's good enough.

HONEY BAR WITH OATS RECIPE aka Nature Valley knockoff bars:


* 2 cup of old fashioned oats
* additional, but SEPARATE 0.5 CUPS of old fashioned oats
* 0.25 cups of honey
* 0.25 cups of coconut oil
* 0.5 cups of whatever dry fruit or nuts you want
* 0.5 tsp of baking soda
* 1.0 tsp vanilla extract

---
Take the separate 0.5 cup of rolled oats and put them, dry, in a blender or food processor until it looks like flour. Once at a flour-like texture, add the baking soda and blend for a few second to bake sure its mixed in.

Mix this 0.5 cup of ""oat flour"" into the 2 cups of old fashioned oats. Take a big spoon and really be sure its as even as you can get it.

Add the honey and coconut oil. Then stir until ita like a dryish cookie dough kind of texture.

Put parchment paper onto a cookie sheet. Then use your hands to get the mix into as flat a sheet you want the bars to be.

Put this into a 350¬∞ preheated oven for 20-30 mins.

Once you take it out, let it cool for like... 10 minutes. Then cut it into bars BEFORE it cools completely.

These do well in foodsaver bags if you want to make a bunch of them all at once and store for later.

798,beznvl,False,None,200,Don't be loyal to your car insurance. Just saved $1000.,povertyfinance,"I live in a state where car insurance is mandatory. A few years back I was unemployed and completely broke. Like -$200 to my name. My car insurance was canceled and a few months later when I was working again I was trying to get insurance. The fact that I had lapsed for so long made it nearly impossible to get insurance. Finally I was able to get [Company A] for around $190 a month. Recently I got a different car. I paid $500 cash for this car. I switched it over on my car insurance and they upped my policy to $300 a month. I called to find out what happened and tried to negotiate. I ended up bringing it down to around $250 a month or $1490ish every 6 months. I told them it was still unacceptable as I don't want anything more than the absolute basic coverage. In two months I would have paid as much in insurance as I paid for my car. If my car gets hit to the point of being non functional I am junking it. It's nearly 20 years old. 

Anyway I started shopping around and ended up switching to [Company B]. I got basic coverage through them and it ended up only costing me $487 for six months if I paid up front (around $600 if I paid month to month). I don't have a lot in savings but I felt this was a good reason to use some savings funds. The idea that I'm going to saving nearly $200 a month is a good feeling. Even compared to my old policy I'm saving around $100 a month. I feel silly for not switching earlier. 

TL;DR: Insurance company jacked up my policy to nearly $1500 every 6 months, shopped around and was able to get a policy for around $500 every 6 months. 

P.S. be prepared to get a million emails and phone calls if you put your information into any sort of car insurance quote site.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/beznvl/dont_be_loyal_to_your_car_insurance_just_saved/,1194,I pay like 180 a month for car insurance.

800,c2pbt8,False,None,145,Tips for getting out of poverty.,povertyfinance,"I‚Äôve been really hesitant to post this because I‚Äôm worried about backlash but I thought I should share what I‚Äôve taken away over the years and hope this would benefit others. I‚Äôve been a longtime lurker with random posts sprinkled around but I wanted to share some tips in hopes that it can give someone out there guidance on getting out of poverty.

Some background real quick, I‚Äôve grown up a minority in poverty with a younger brother and a single mom.  I worked in fast food starting at $6.25/hr and banking from the age of 15 till late college. In the last 7 years I‚Äôve graduated from college ended my full-time teller role and have been fulfilling my career choice as a designer throughout multiple roles. I live in an area with an average cost of living making close to six figures with plenty of room to grow. Here are some tips for things I‚Äôve learned throughout the years that might be useful for people looking to break out of poverty, I hope it can help someone.

Quick Note: There is no guaranteed list of tips that you will make it out of poverty, regardless of how hard/smart you work. There are plenty of factors of which you can't control, and many people are unfortunately and unfairly chained in place because of the society we live in. I hold the opinion that you do have a say in how much you let it affect you mentally and emotionally, and those thoughts can and will adjust your advancement through life.



**Tip #1: Health is your first wealth**

Stay healthy, keeps your mind fresh and body strong. Hopefully, less doctor visits too! This should really be the longest paragraph as it‚Äôs probably the most important but we all know the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. I do not mean you should be an all-star athlete, but somewhat conscious about what you put into your body and what your daily routine entails.



**Tip #2: Counter lifestyle/expense creep**

When new monthly expenses come up try to pull funding from something else; do you have a monthly payment plan for a medical bill? It may be time to shop for new car insurance plans, look at phone plans, lower internet speed plan, cancel cable, try a cheaper gym, or maybe cancel Netflix, Hulu or Spotify. Do not continue to tack on expenses without trying to balance out new expenses with old ones. It may not always be possible to balance out new expenses but it helps. This is a habit I follow to this day and it has definitely limited me from an unhealthy lifestyle creep.



**Tip  #3: Workplace loyalty is worthless.**

I‚Äôve literally worked myself to permanent damage to my body for a company that praised me, offered me a 5% raise and months later wanted to force me out because of stress-related health issues. I left and couldn‚Äôt be happier, but my illness will most likely stick around for life and is a constant reminder of what a stressful, thankless job can do. In 2 years since leaving I‚Äôve found more meaningful employment, a 42% increase in salary, and amazing benefits.

As u/txdahlia mentioned, do not burn your bridges no matter how awful your time was, and if you have an exit interview, offer constructive feedback in a professional manner. It is not a good idea to quit your job if you do not have another one lined up.



**Tip #4: Strive to be the best version of yourself, and be a little social.**

Be the best at what you do, that includes your job, but as noted before don‚Äôt get carried away. Strive to be the best friend, brother, uncle you can be to others by lending an ear, spend time with the family, go out with coworkers or invite them to a game night. This is more for building self-confidence, especially as an introvert.



**Tip #5: Be uncomfortable**

Push yourself to be uncomfortable positions. When I started working it was fast food from high school through most of college. I knew I was limited in my earning potential and then a friend of mine got a job at a bank and I thought ‚ÄúIf he can do it, so can I‚Äù. I knew it‚Äôd be stressful, I‚Äôd be uncomfortable and would do things I‚Äôd never done before. It scared me to death to touch money (I was a cook in fast food), so much that I even bought Monopoly money to practice counting. I took it on and that position helped me gain soft skills in talking to people in all kinds of situations even to this day. This was my first real experience with trying something new and it paid off, don‚Äôt ever get comfortable.



**Tip #6: Learn from your mistakes / It‚Äôs ok to fail.**

What I didn‚Äôt tell you was that I horribly failed my first bank teller interview, I was the youngest person in a group interview and inexperienced as can be, what I did learn was what the interviewers responded positively to and how to take that to my next bank interview. I ended up getting that position that lasted me through college. Today I learn from my mistakes in other ways but that was the start.



**Tip #7: Invest in yourself**

Most people think of investing as stocks, and bonds. The truth is unfortunately most people aren‚Äôt in a position to get into buying company shares and that‚Äôs fine for now. Invest in yourself by learning new skills that will make you valuable in your career path or daily life. Listen to podcasts about leadership, money management, read a bit about human psychology, the list goes on and on.



**Tip #8: Invest in yourself, again. (Stocks this time)**

If you‚Äôre still hung up on investing with money, please first look into having an emergency fund, pay off high interest debts, joining your companies 401k plan, opening a Roth IRA, and then maybe, start something like M1Finance which will let you get started with a few bucks, don‚Äôt expect much though. Investing is about time in the market not timing the market. I highly recommend investing early, something I wish I started doing in college but didn‚Äôt really start doing until my late 20‚Äôs.



**Tip#9: Try to make your ‚Äúwants‚Äù correlate with your needs.**

I wanted a decent camera for a long time so I took a photography class as an elective in college that required a mid-grade digital camera. I spent a pretty penny and still use this camera today. It really wasn‚Äôt high-end back then and definitely isn‚Äôt today, but since I‚Äôve bought it I‚Äôve made the initial cost of the camera and lenses back ten times over, in fact I‚Äôll be shooting an event this weekend, and getting paid for a hobby I took up in college, it‚Äôs also been helpful in my prior workplaces as well. (This is an example of Tip #7)



**Tip 10: There‚Äôs a time for everything.**

There are some ‚Äúwants‚Äù that never go away but it doesn‚Äôt mean you need to spring on them right away. Patience, friend. Understand most wants are not fulfilling and once you have it it‚Äôll likely loose most of its shiny pretty quickly. Instead set a goal date, maybe create a goal savings tied to it, if your item costs $100, try to save $200 before buying your item to ensure that you have some money left over if an emergency suddenly comes out of nowhere.



**Tip #11: Shop for mid-grade items if possible.**

You don‚Äôt always need the best, but that doesn‚Äôt always mean you should get the worst either. As we know cheap items don‚Äôt last long. Shop for mid-grade products if you can afford them, they‚Äôll most likely last as long as the high-end product, or work just as well.



**Tip #12: Hide money from yourself. (If you can)**

I‚Äôve noticed that when my bank account balance starts increasing so do my spending habits, for that reason I have multiple savings accounts and only use a local account for bills. I usually make sure to note upcoming bills and create a buffer before doing this; you do not want an overdraft.

An easy way to start this is by keeping your change in a drawer or setting aside $20 at your own frequency. I know this is especially tough for some people here but try not to get discouraged, you‚Äôll get there.



**Tip #13: Medical bills**

Always call the finance department if you land in the hospital, if they can‚Äôt lower your bill based on your income, they will at least allow a payment plan.

If something looks wrong on your medical bill fight it, learn to talk their language, speak their terms, understand your rights. I once had a bill go to collections that I fought for months with my insurance company, It went from $1000 to 0 and erased from my credit.



**Tip #14: You don‚Äôt need to go to a private college.**

Go to a community college or a public state college or university, it‚Äôs cheaper and you‚Äôll come out with much less or no debt. My public university cost around 4K a semester, and through work and Pell Grants I was able to graduate debt free while living at home. No one cares about what college I went to, they just know I‚Äôm good at what I do and my experience in the field. Also, buy used books if you can.

Expansion on this tip. (Thanks, u/socialmeritwarrior)



14B: Be smart about college

If you go to college, make sure you're going for something that earns money. Why go from making $12/hr to making $12/hr with $50k debt?



14C: Don't go to college

Go to trade school! Not everyone can hack college. That's OK! Trades can pay very well, and some are in very high demand! Many other users have mentioned getting into sales as well.



**Tip#15: Live at home as long as you can**

If you‚Äôre able and willing stay at home as long as possible, this kept my college expenses low and I was able to give back to my family while living at home in the form of buying groceries and doing house chores, my last year of college I was able to start actually saving money that gave me a good buffer once I moved out.



**Tip #16: There‚Äôs always a time to move on**

Before I had my child I was pretty happy with my first career job earning an entry-level wage of $14 an hour with $0.25 raises right out of college for a few years, mostly out of ignorance. Then my wife got pregnant and we looked into the cost of childcare. I realized there would be little to no savings per month, and if we‚Äôre being honest we‚Äôd for sure go negative. It was time to move on. I found a job in my field that doubled my salary after about a month of searching. After a few years in that position the next job search took about 5 days, and my most recent I was head-hunted/poached.



**Tip #17: Never stop looking**

You might be happy with your job, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt look at what‚Äôs out there, make it a point to look at openings every month or so to see skills required in your profession or what a senior role looks like in your career if this applies to you.



**Tip #18: Linkedin profile / Resume**

Always keep your LinkedIn profile up to date. I‚Äôve been able to connect with industry leaders, make friends and even get a job all in my field by making sure I have an updated profile. If LinkedIn doesn‚Äôt apply to you try having an up-to-date Indeed profile, or do both!

Expansion to this tip: You should always talk about your duties or responsibilities but I find it helpful to also speak to your accomplishments in that specific role. Hiring managers want to know how you can help the company they‚Äôre hiring for and what you can theoretically accomplish for them if they hire you.

Note: Have a close family member or friend check your resume, ask for feedback on how it can be improved.



**Tip #19 Re-visit finances occasionally**

Once in a while, double check what you‚Äôve been spending money on, see if you can cut back on eating out or gift shopping if that‚Äôs a problem by reminding yourself of what you could have saved. I like to use Mint to see my spending per category. Other people use YNAB (You Need A Budget).



**Tip #20: Disconnect going out from spending money** (Thanks, u/harrison_wintergreen)

You can still go out with friends even if you don‚Äôt have money, you don‚Äôt need to feel guilty for yourself for doing it either. You can let your friends know of your situation, or just let them know you‚Äôre not planning on spending any money and stick to it, if your having a problem with spending, keep your debit/credit card/cash away from you to make the temptation a little easier.



**Tip#21: Quit comparing yourself**

Quit comparing yourself to others, it brings undue stress and there is always someone doing better or worse than you. Life goes at a different pace for everyone. Focus on yourself, if you have trouble with comparing let it drive you to be a better person and reach that next goal.



**Tip#22: Ask questions**

Some people will tell you freely about how they reached success, ask them how they did it, a mentor is a great way to learn and grow!



**Tip#23: Don't give what you can't afford to give.** (Thanks, u/KnowanUKnow)

Try to be low-key about what you do have, because people will come asking. If you do have something to lend, expect it to be gone forever (money, credit \[i.e. co-signing\], items). There is no guarantee you'll get it back.



**Tip#24: Unionize or Join a Union**

I have no experience in this but some users have commented that this should be on the list and I agree. There are always benefits in joining people that have a common cause and your interests in mind.



**Tip#25: Do not squander opportunity.** (Thanks, u/nugdunk

Recognize an opportunity and take it. Everyone's opportunities will be different, it's important to recognize when they are available and take advantage.



**Tip#26: Prioritize your life.**

There are bills that you must prioritize, rent, and utilities are probably the most important. These are things you need to pay in order to survive. Pay them first.



26B: People and time are also a huge priority:

Figure out what makes the most positive impact in your life that's worth spending time/money on. Find out what costs the least to make the most difference in your life. If people are bringing you or your cause down, limit your availability or cut them out. Wasted time and 'wasted' people are not worth it.



That‚Äôs really all I have for now, I know this isn‚Äôt a catch-all for advice for people in particular situations but I hope this is useful to someone looking to get out of poverty.

In all seriousness, I don't think happiness is a situational thing. Whether I'm just ""an unhappy person"", or I just keep finding things to be unhappy about, financial gains definitely haven't helped with that.

808,8w674k,False,None,220,I used to ignore this advice but it helped me save $300 per month,povertyfinance,"To start, I know we're all at different levels and some people literally can't save. That's fine. This advice might not work for everyone.

But I used to ignore people when they said **just set your direct deposit to automatically transfer money from your paycheck to savings** . I thought that just wasn't *me*. I thought I'd inevitably end up taking the money out.

For some reason, I decided in October to try it. I set my direct deposit up to put $150 per pay period into savings. (You could set it to anything you can afford to spare. $10, $25, $500, $1000, whatever.)

Lo and behold, I've actually been able to stick to it. Sure, it's been insanely hard. I ended up with $4 in my checking account for about a week and ended up eating ramen several times.

810,883cqz,False,None,149,"LPT: Never ""Post-Date"" Rent Checks To Your Landlord",povertyfinance,"Like most renters, I use to mail out my rent check a few days before the first of the month to ensure the rent check got to my landlord before the due-date.

Landlords in my town are notoriously scummy, so I would make it a habit to ""post-date"" my rent check for the first of the month to ensure it wouldn't be cashed before it was due. I thought this would work. I thought I was ""adulting.""

But I was wrong. A few years ago: two days before the first, I got an alert on my phone that my checking account had been overdrawn with a negative -$647.12 balance. Panicked, I checked my bank account only to find that my landlord has already cashed my rent check. ""That doesn't make sense,"" I told myself. ""There's no way he could have cashed it before the first. I wrote the first of the month on the check. Somethings wrong.""

So I called my bank's customer service number only to find out that my bank has honored the check and posted it to my account, overdrawing my account to the tune of a sweet $38 free. And trust me, back then, $38 was the difference between two weeks of cheap Top Ramen and two weeks of luxuriously baked spaghetti.

Contrary to popular belief, banks are under no legal obligation to the honor your request to postpone processing a check until the date written on a check. Even if you ""post-date"" a check for some date in the future, the payee can immediately cash the check upon receipt. Why? Once a check is signed, the check becomes legal tender and a bank can process the check at their discretion ‚Äì even if that includes disregarding a check's written date.

The bottom line: Never write a check you an amount you cannot cash when you sign your name. It is up to the individual recipient of the check to honor the date written on the check.

I made a lot of stupid mistakes with my finances.  I never learned how to budget, it wasn't something my family did.

I went from earning $30k/year to $62.5k/year (plus bonuses) in 7 years.  What's a guy who makes over $60k a year doing subscribed to r/povertyfinance ?

During the same time period my credit card limits increased a lot (Edit: Limits totaled up to over $35,000).  My line of credit went from $5000, to $10,000 to $20,000 to $30,000.   I spent money faster than it was coming in, and I didn't care because the next pay, or the tax return, or some imaginary future money was going to take care of the problem for me.  My increased income kept pace with my increased debts and the monthly interest payments.  In reality I had very little money, and always felt financially squeezed.

I bought people Christmas gifts without concern about budget.  Why try to come up with a special thoughtful reasonably priced gift when you can just spend more money?  [I guess I went with the Michael Scott philosophy.](https://youtu.be/Z_EJY-qHjpM)

I ordered from Skip The Dishes and Doordash constantly.  I never tried to save money on groceries.  I bought whatever new electronics I wanted.  I got a bad deal on a car loan because my credit score was crap (utilization ratio was too high).

I made some pretty weak attempts at paying off my debts.  Shifted things around to a 0% introductory offer on a credit card.  Tried the debt payment snowball method.  Tried to get a debt consolidation loan from my largest creditor.  Put half my tax refund dollars into lump sum debt payments.

But I was an idiot and spent it all again anyway.

And a couple years ago my income dropped by about $10,000 a year.  And the bonuses stopped.

All of a sudden on average I was making $833 less per month in salary, and I lost about $3000 per quarter in after tax bonuses.

That's a lot of money when you're paying over $1000 a month in just debt service.

My temporary layoff from work wasn't the straw that broke the camel's back.  It was more like adding a lot of fuel to something that's already burning out of control.

I figured bankruptcy was coming for a while.  And Corona just sped up the process.

I know I'm going to catch a lot of downvotes and hate for this.  I know a lot of people will shame me for not taking responsibility for repaying my debts.

But it was starting to have an effect on my health.  I wasn't sleeping because I was worried about money.  I filled up my voicemail on purpose so I couldn't get any more voicemails from debt collectors.

I screwed up.

Now that the paperwork is filed I honestly feel a lot better.  I get a second chance.

And the more I read about it why is it possible for the executives of Sears, and Toys R Us, and Remington and, Bear Stearns to make millions while their companies go bankrupt?  Why do rich business owners treat bankruptcy like a tool, where they'll go bankrupt multiple times before hitting a good idea.  Trump filed for corporate insolvency 4 times, and was still considered to be successful (I'm not here to argue about US politics, I'm Canadian and I don't care).

[This video](https://youtu.be/Z-bGWIumK4o) came up in my YouTube suggested videos.  I guess my google searches for bankruptcy and financial advice bled into the YouTube algorithm.  This also made me feel better about my choice.

So in the space of a day I went from feeling low, and feeling uncertain and nervous and scared to feeling refreshed.  I feel like I'm looking at a new blank piece of paper.

I won't make the same mistakes again. I'm using YNAB to track everything.  No more credit cards.  No more loans.  Cash, or I can't have it.  So - any tips from the redditors of r/povertyfinance on living within your means?

If you got this far, thanks for letting me vent.  


Edit: I was writing a response to a downvoted comment that now appears to be deleted, so I'll put my response here:  


""I get your anger.  I was of the same opinion for a long time, which is why I didn't like myself for a long time.  I was outwardly successful, an organized leader, someone people came to for advice, someone people wanted to work with.

But on the inside I was a guy who had been making poor financial and life decisions for a long time.  On the inside I wasn't the same person I appeared to be on the outside.

I don't feel good about making bad choices.  But I am appreciative that there is a legal way out of it.

Have you ever dried to dig a hole in dry sand?  After every shovelful taken out more sand slides into the hole you left behind.  Pick up extra shifts?  Car needs $1200 in repairs.  Have a good month and make a little extra money?  Need new shoes for work because the last pair have holes in them now.

Yes - completely my fault.  I should have known better.  But I didn't.

I know better now, and will never be in the same situation again.""

821,a5lkpa,False,None,102,A number to be proud of.,povertyfinance,"Hello r/povertyfinance! 

&#x200B;

I have been poor my entire life. I grew up poor and spent most of my adult life struggling to keep my head above water. After high school I worked 12 hour shifts in a factory because I couldn't afford to go to college. I lived in dumpy apartments, drove rusted out beaters and spent weeks eating generic mac&cheese and Ramen noodles just to make it through to the next paycheck. A few years ago I put myself through technical college (my 2-year degree took me 5 years part-time) and got an associate's degree. I got a better paying job, although I work a couple of part time jobs, as full time jobs in my field are rare. Even with a small bump in income I figured I would work paycheck to paycheck my entire life. A couple of years ago though I found Reddit; I found the r/personalfinance sub and read all about how to save money, pay off debt & heal my credit score. I kind of rolled my eyes, but followed some of the advice as best I could. Then I found r/povertyfinance and followed the advice here which was more tailored to my actual financial situation.  Well, after three years of hard work & sacrifice I can say that while I don't have a stock portfolio and a 2nd house in the Hamptons, I have over $1,000 in savings, I haven't paid a bill late in 2 years and my FICO score is now above 750 for the first time in my life (for those who are interested, I was at about 600). I just refinanced my car last month and was offered a prime interest rate. I almost cried. I went from paying 13% interest a few years ago to 2.4% this month. I know it wouldn't mean much to a lot of people, but I feel like I'm finally pulling myself out of the poverty pit. I just wanted to share with some people who would understand how hard of a struggle it was and how proud I am.

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: Crawling out of poverty thanks to reddit!

Edit: A couple of people have asked specifically how I was able to do this. The biggest help came from using the debt snowball method, creating a Mint account, which helped me track all of my spending and set up budgets, and sticking to my goals of paying down my debt, raising my credit rating and building savings. I'm still not 100% out of the woods yet, I have a few thousand left to pay on my student loans and car payment, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I‚Äôve been on disability since 2015 after two back-to-back psychiatric hospitalizations in 2012/13. Leading up to that I was working 72 hours a week as an STNA in the home health field. I worked every single solitary day for over two years. Although I‚Äôve struggled a lifetime with mental illness, this was the first time I was on my own and free from my abusive parents. I was advised by my at-the-time psychiatrist to no longer work due to a diagnoses of catatonic schizophrenia (now deemed two separate illnesses). It was a very hard thing for me to accept. As a child, my parents involved me with what was happening with finances. They frequently used scare tactics of losing the house vs. food, filing for bankruptcy, and honestly too much for a child to carry. My dad always drove into me with intense frequency that you should ‚Äòwork hard while your young so you can retire early.‚Äù Sprinkled throughout is, imo expectedly, more heartbreak, trauma, and emotional scarring that over 13 years of therapy simply hasn‚Äôt fixed yet. All of that had a huge blow to the opportunities set ahead of me and it was seemingly for the purpose of destroying me. I was given only the advice of, ‚Äúcredit card BAAAADD. saving is GOOD‚Äù and that‚Äôs where it ended. Although it is not entirely bad or wrong advice, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs just not like that. I never applied for a credit card, believing that I would be doomed for eternity to financial suffering and I would be denied because of my disability. And it‚Äôs all just a bunch of bs to keep me small. I know. What assholes???!!

Well I‚Äôm happy to say that my parents didn‚Äôt break me and they didn‚Äôt stop me. I now have had a credit card for 4 months, a paid off student loan for a year, a credit score at about 680 and finally... the cherry... however small.. is the $500 in my long-term savings. Although paying off a student loan is huge, a good score is... well, GOOD.. I honestly have felt that that long term was stuck. Everything saved was kept short term and depleted time and time again. Even being on the wimpy ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù income I have from SSDI I was able to do all of this. I just wanted to share that with you all. I want to only be a quick reminder that you can do it. We can all do it. Even on limited income. We will not be broken and we will not remain broke.

The effect of reducing your interest rates cannot be expressed enough. Interest builds on itself and grows exponentially.

Consolidation loans are also far better for your credit score because they count as a loans and not as credit card debt, which will dramatically improve your credit score, as the two kinds of debt are scored completely differently.

&#x200B;

I can't begin to describe what I'm feeling right now. Relief, joy, a drained bank account, but overall happy.

I just submitted the final payment on two of my cards and $450 on the last one, of which I still have a remaining balance of $166. It's still a decent amount of money but it's nothing another paycheck can't fix. But I'm not totally debt-free, I didn't post this in my original post, but I do owe some money to my mom ($1,500 for helping me get back into college, I kept putting it off because I didn't have the funds, nor the saving habits I have now. She agreed to pay for the first quarter on the stipulation that I pay her back and do well in school. Grades are good, just have to pay her back) as well as my brother ($300 for driving me around to the dog sitting gigs) and on the upside, I'll have my own car to drive myself very very soon so I won't have to rely on him anymore. 

&#x200B;

I've set all my cards on auto-pay, with notifications if I go over a set amount (well below my 30% utilization)  the banks will text me about it. 

&#x200B;

To celebrate I'm gonna go out with friends for dinner, and then on Saturday I'm going on a 3 day trip with my boyfriend until Tuesday, gonna relax and unwind and wait for the next paycheck (which will be larger considering one week I worked 41 hours when I was only scheduled for 28.)

For the curious, I set up and second  savings account in a different bank and had an automatic amount pulled off my paycheck. I dipped in to it a few times (needs must) but  it worked. 

I don't think I will make it to my other goal of investing  another $5000 by the end of the years but I will see what i can do. 

Wish me luck.

EDIT : Thank you all for your kind words. Yall have been very kind and supportive. 

 As for those asking how i did it mostly I had to come to a realization last year that there is some truth to the saying "" if you chase two rabbits, you catch neither "" I other words debts vs savings. I was chasing debts harder that saving and so I switched. If something happens lower debt balances will not help me but cash in hand will. It really is just that simple. 

Also I was giving a lot of thought to the concept of the Black Swan, The idea that unpredictable outliers are what will catch you completely off guard.  You can not really plan for a Black Swan but you can bet it will cost you money. 

Thank you all for listen me I really was not expecting this kind of response. I am deeply humbled.

840,d3m8nj,False,None,51,I feel like I can breathe!!!,povertyfinance,"This is going to be ranty but I am so excited and I have no one to tell! I‚Äôm 19. I moved out when I was 15 and started working, and tried to learn my finances as I went. Last year, I got a couple credit cards and after ending up in a bad place mentally I started buying things to make myself feel better. In June I was facing moving back in with my abusive family because I was 6k in debt (just cards, not my vehicle) and didn‚Äôt have enough money to pay my basic bills, let alone food, etc. 

Also in June, a new job found me. They pay above minimum wage, we are tipped (in a monthly check) AND I was able to land housing through them! 

With no rent/utilities, I FINALLY was able to feed myself and start looking at getting my shit together.  I‚Äôve been working at it since and making progress.

Tonight I got my check that includes my  monthly tips ($1840.00 total). I put $240 in my checking for food and gas, leaving $1600 (!!) for the rest. I paid the remainder of cards for $175, $67, $66, $730 AND put $550 towards a card that has been past maxed out for 6 months at $2300+. 

I now owe less than $1800 not including my car and I‚Äôm looking at being out of debt as soon as MEXT MONTH. 

The kicker, and the part I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for, is that I even have $1100 in my savings (although some will be going for shots for my dog this month.)

I feel like I can breathe again and it‚Äôs incredible

843,87ozgx,False,None,202,How I got from welfare to upper middle class,povertyfinance,"Hey all, I'm not sure how helpful this anecdotal story will be, but I'm really excited about this community and wanted to contribute what I could.  I grew up with a lot of 'checkboxes'--welfare, single parent household, drug abusive mom, and many more.  I was a poor student, surrounded by poor influences and no one--including myself--had a lot of expectations.  I remember my mom teaching me how to steal gloves from the Salvation Army.  I remember digging through couch cushions for McDonald's money.  I remember the elation of 'renters rebates' so I could get school clothes.  I remember being poor.  I started working at 15 and landed a job at the local movie theatre making $5.15 an hour.  I was emancipated at 17 and basically couch surfed through high school.  I stayed dedicated to my job at the theatre throughout and by the time I graduated high school I was an assistant manager and had no plans for college.  One day the manager drove in with his brand new Dodge Stratus and I found out a theatre manager's salary was around 35k and that seemed more than adequate, so that became my plan.  

I eventually was dragged by my old social workers (now ""adopted grandmas"") to at least attempt to go to college.  My grades were terrible so not only were there no scholarships available, but I was rejected by every university in my city.  I eventually saved enough to afford a single algebra class at the local community college.  I worked hard and got an A.  I used that to prove to the universities that I was trying to turn over a new leaf.  Once accepted I had to start the arduous process of paying for college. It took a ton of research and back and forth (I did not have anyone to go to with experience on this topic).  Thankfully Pell grants and subsidized student loans were enough to cover everything but books.  I took out a little extra in student loans when needed to pay rent and keep my head above water.  After a year and a half at the local state university campus I applied to go to the ""Main U"" in the state capital (my first time outside my hometown).  I was Pre-Law at first but switched to Computer Science about a year in when I heard about salary and job prospects.  At this point I was prideful and felt I had enough experience in CS to justify an internship.  I applied a lot and got rejected a lot.  After living off my girlfriends server wages for a few months I sucked it up realizing I was not ready and got another job at the theatre.  I spent a lot of time at this point learning about my field, reading books, doing side projects, whatever could make me seem more appealing.

I finally got a break in my Junior year of college and got a job at a student consulting firm doing odd projects for Thomson Reuters. I worked 20 hours a week, made $13.50 an hour and was getting direct experience in my field.  I interviewed a lot before and had a lot of rejections.  I remember I was sweaty-palmed and walked around the block a few times before my interview and when I got the job I bought my girlfriend (now wife) a stupidly expensive (relatively) purse with my first check.  From here, I had my break. I worked there through college, interned directly with Thomson Reuters and was much better poised for interviews as I approached graduation.  I got lucky and landed my first job at Microsoft making 81k a year.  It was a mind-boggling amount of money.  I ate peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day until my first check came in.  

Since then I've worked miscellaneous places in tech and have increase my salary significantly.  I thrive at work and I attribute a lot of that to the fact that I had to learn to problem solve and not succumb to fear early on.  Some middle aged guy shouting at me about a deadline doesn't bother me, but for some 'silver spoons' who haven't faced real conflict before it absolutely ravages them and they shut down.  People who grew up poor often have a lot of perspective and skills that are valuable to major companies. I'm 29 right now and  I just bought my first house, have a solid retirement plan and am able to buy things, travel and help others without worrying about next month.  It's still so surreal.

Like I said, this is just a big anecdotal story.  I am well-spoken and white (which I acknowledge has given me privileges despite my upbringing).  I chose a career (intentionally) that has a surplus of jobs and high salaries and thankfully had a natural aptitude for it.  I had support from social structures.  And I probably got lucky saying the right thing to the right interviewer a time or two...I don't know if I would have landed the jobs I did if I applied again.  The main goal of this story is just to share a path of how I made it from A to B.  Anyone else here, I wish you the absolute best in doing the same!

The free no-minimum shipping is a crazy good deal.  In my experience it's usually about 2-3 days to arrive and the prices are generally the same as store prices.

847,88rhfp,False,None,129,Can we ban the suggestion of giving up your children?,povertyfinance,"This is something I saw and even heard in PF, but hoped not to find here. Alas, I've seen one outright suggestion and one allusion already this morning. While I admit that truthfully giving up your child/ren would likely improve your financial situation, people making these suggestions are either not giving this suggestion enough thought or simply making a political point. There are a plethora of legitimate reasons not to consider this option. Medical condition with genetic factors are most likely to be seen and recognized by biological family members, for example. Different studies show that adopted children are frequently less favored than natural children. Older children are less likely to be adopted and more likely to be placed in foster care, which is a vipers nest of its own. Culturally parents who give up their children may be shamed, even by their family and essential support networks. The list goes on and on. No one knows the exact circumstances of someone's parenthood and their decisions to keep or give up their child. This suggestion is often cruel, and almost always pointless.

Edit: I've been up all night and have an Easter Egg hunt to do before I can sleep. Ultimately the point I'm making is that this suggestion is trolling, regardless of the commenters actual intent. Most people who've been around PF for a while have seen this argument before and it plays out the same way every time. It hurts and angers people and accomplishes nothing. It should be considered trolling and gotten rid of when seen. If you have a legitimate reason why we shouldn't push the mods for this, please say so.

Edit 2: Oh, also, we all know that at least like...half the people who say this stuff are just doing it to take a jab at ""poor people having too many kids and living off the system."" It's a political statement made in such a way they think they can get away with it. That's already against the rules.

I guess we just need to examine what is one's true motivations when being on this subreddit. Are we trying to survive or flourish?

I don't say this for political value, I say it because think about the financial commitment (which is one of the main conversational foundations of this subreddit). Your reasons for not giving up children are all reasons to keep this financial burden and therefore not really trying to flourish and live financially. 

I honestly cannot see how one can try and live financially responsible and not consider adoption an option. 

I have a $230 a month car payment, plus $160 in car insurance. If I gave up my car, that's $390 I could be saving. People will shame me for being poor, but screw em. My car might go to a scrap yard, but I am saving money which was my original intention. What happens to my child or my car after I get rid of them is no longer a financial issue for me. I am no longer committed to making monthly payments like that.

You likely don't have a $1,000 emergency fund, and you're close to the worst case scenario. I know it, I've lived it, and I want to help as many people as possible get out of it.

So, what are you to do in this situation? How can you get through all of this when you‚Äôre only bringing home around $600 every two weeks? The answer a lot of people will get when they are honest with themselves is that sacrifices will have to be made. Whether it‚Äôs cable TV, the new iPhone, or your free time, if you are in this situation where you have this little cash coming in AND you have debt, you probably are either deluding yourself that if you keep on the treadmill things will get better, but the fact is that interest every month when you don‚Äôt pay off your cards is speeding that treadmill up, and eventually you‚Äôll fall off.  An overdraft or two, and suddenly you‚Äôre eyeing a payday loan place just to solve the problem. Stop. Now. If you‚Äôre in this situation, let‚Äôs back up the cardiac arrest, take a few deep breaths and give you a rational plan to deal with this:

Gather up all your monthly bills and pay stubs, pull up your online banking, too.

Look at what you spend your money on, and decide what you want to cut.

**Keep cutting until your bills and expenses are less than your take home pay.**

Next, make calls to all of your credit card companies, and ask for lower interest rates.

Add up all of your minimum monthly payments and monthly recurring bills.

Open a new checking account, preferably without a debit card.

Set up your direct deposit to go to two accounts: one for half the amount you got in step 5, and one for the remainder.

You‚Äôve now built a self-funding small emergency fund.

The remaining money should cover your expenses (groceries, gas, etc).

At the end of every two weeks, the night before payday, take any remaining money, and pay it on your highest interest account. You‚Äôll pay down your debt a little faster and start to see some progress.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, and you‚Äôre still having some trouble making ends meet, go back to step two, and be honest with yourself.  Cutting cable TV alone will save you between 600 and 1200 a year. Cutting other things should be on the table.

a few days ago I was preparing to make a post on here and honestly thought about it and with the stated purpose behind poverty finance it just didn't make sense.  It was (in my opinion) good information that might help people save money but with the purpose of the sub didn't feel like the right place.  

Similarly Personal finance might have based on name been the right place, but in reality and based on having been subbed there for over two years really didn't feel right either. So I took a look around and didn't feel like there was a place to discuss being in the middle class and dealing with issues like I was thinking about posting about or asking questions.  

r/MiddleClassFinance is meant to be a place where people can come and have a discussion about middle class financial issues, questions, tips or advice.  

All are welcome, so come on down and join us if you'd like!  

Thanks,

And my lenses had fogged and the coatings had half scratched off. So I set aside for eye exam, and then was like Okay, walmart. I know my lenses are going to eat my budget. Boy. Boy did they ever. I cried after I left because I had a 200 dollar budget and my lenses took up 197 of that. I had a choice of like 4 different frames. That's pretty much it. So I ordered the least offensive and left. 

Next day I called to cancel, a friend told me to hands down, go online. I had my PD, I had my prescription, go online. So I called up walmart and canceled and spent an hour uploading a picture and taking a chance on glasses online. Zenni's to be precise. What was 220 bucks with walmart, was 77 bucks with zenni's. That included their fastest shipping, super thin lenses, and case and clip ons. I though okay, worst is I just learned a 77 dollar lesson. 

They came today. I'm in tears and it's good tears. I can see why my migraines picked up frequency. I'm not looking through a haze, and they look -good-. There is no buyers remorse, there's no WTF am I doing. 

So if you're like me, and you are in desperate need of new glasses and I know that it's like super scary to think about buying your -eyeglasses- online, try. For the price of 1 walmart pair, I have a pair, can get sunglasses to protect my eyes in the summer and then also get another spare frame of the same kind, just in case god forbid, something happens. And still get groceries for the week. 

And they don't look like shit. At all. They look REALLY great and I love them as much as my old pair that I kept getting repaired because I loved them so much.

862,gf5vsz,False,Debt/Loans/Credit,32,The giant collections account was finally removed from my credit report,povertyfinance,"I just needed to share this somewhere. I have (or had!!) a collections account for $2000. Basically what happened was, about three/four years ago my very abusive ex went to jail and I was able to escape the apartment I was in. It was a month to month lease so I went to the property management, explained the entire situation, explained that in his fits of rage he had absolutely destroyed the unit by ripping off doors/punching holes in the way. They said as long as I left the unit within a few days and was agreeing to forfeit my deposit, they wouldn‚Äôt hold me liable for the damages. 

Out of sight out of mind. Except a year later I got a phone call from a collections company stating they sent me to collections. I don‚Äôt know why they went after me other than money is money and I‚Äôm likely easier to find considering the ex is in and out of jail and doesn‚Äôt work whereas I‚Äôve been in the same general area for years and worked the entire time. It was for $2000. I got freaked out when they called and hung up to avoid admitting the debt was mine. 

The only thing holding back my credit score was this fucking collections account. I make every single payment on time, keep my utilization low, and pay the full balance on time every month. But having a huge collections account is obviously horrible for your score. Two of the credit bureaus didn‚Äôt recognize that I had an account in collections but my experian score still did. 

I disputed it once before and was denied. I didn‚Äôt want to start making payments on it but I didn‚Äôt want it to just sit there. I didn‚Äôt really have enough money sitting around in full until very recently but I was still hesitant even paying it. A month ago, I tried disputing it again.

The city came by, cleared the road, and put all the debris into my lawn and told me that the tree is so badly damaged, it's dangerous, and could fall onto my home.  

Here's the kicker, because there was no damage to my actual physical home (lawn is destroyed, the healthy tree is destroyed) my insurance won't pay for the debris removal or tree removal even though I pay extra for that exact coverage... but I guess ONLY in the scenario if the tree hit my home.

Like, I get it if I wasn't keeping up with it's maintenance, but this was a healthy tree that got destroyed during a tornado.  If I remove this 50 foot oak, not only will the value of my house drop, but I will lose the shade and cooling it provides.

And now, because the tree is considered a hazard, if in 6 months it falls, insurance could deny the claim because I didn't take care of the tree now.

NOW.",povertyfinance,"i actually work in a midwest CU but i was embarrassed to apply for a refinance because i knew how bad my credit score was and i didn't want any of my coworkers to know.  
  
push came to shove at the beginning of last month. i had been driving with temp plates for the better part of a year and finally got stopped and hit with a hefty ticket. a kind coworker stepped in and offered to quietly set me up with a personal loan to pay the ticket and get my car registered. the interest rate was about 14% (with a 583 credit score and a massive debt to income ratio). 
  
once that was done, she came back to me and set another offer in front of me: refi my car loan at the CU, roll in the new personal loan she'd just drawn up for me, *add* in my two credit cards and make my single monthly payment cheaper than my original car note's. i was floored.  
  
i now have a 12% rate--down from 25.66% at my other finance company, my credit score is going to leap up since both of my cards are now paid off (and won't be used unless it is absolutely fucking necessary), and in total, i am now saving $317 a month. that may not seem like a lot to some people, but it's huge for me. that money is an oil change, a visit to the dentist, going back to my therapist, and a whole host of things i've avoided because i couldn't find it in my budget.  
  
TL;DR: if you're struggling, please reach out to a credit union. every single one of my coworkers is kind, understanding and reserve judgment in every situation. i mean, it's why credit unions were even created--for people in poverty like us. they offer *so* much more than a traditional bank, even if all you bring to them are your loans.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôm stressed and scared and I really need some help.",povertyfinance,"I am shaking while writing this, but I know that I need to suck it up and put it all out there. I've been struggling financially for the past few months and I am feeling so suffocated under all of this that I can't see a way out. I have been more stressed and anxious about this than anything else in my life. I could barely sleep last night, my heart beating out of my chest, knowing that I was going to type this post up and submit it today, asking for help/advice/suggestions/a way forward.

I feel so overwhelmed I don't even know where to begin.

First, some info about me: I am a 26 year old law student, in the middle of my final year of school. I go to school full-time, am a senior editor on the law school's law review, and I also work two part-time jobs (one is at Starbucks, the other is a legal internship for the federal government that limits me on how many hours I can work). I do about 12-18 hours at starbucks and only 4 hours with the government per week. On top of that, I am doing lots of post-graduation job searching, networking, applying, interviewing and other things to try and help me find decent-paying legal work after I graduate. I have little to no time formyself and It is *killing me*. I am stretched thin, tired, losing weight, struggling to keep up in school and on top of all this, I've always got money and my debt and my insufficient income to help me out on my mind.¬†

I've tried reading some self-help financial books, but a lot of them seem to be geared more towards people who are already pretty financially stable, who need advice investing or saving for retirement, etc. I can't even begin to think about that right now. It scares me, freaks me out, makes my heart rate speed up. I am terrified that I've fucked over my future, because of stupid decisions and irresponsibility.

When I graduate in the spring, I will have roughly $150,000 in student loans. That thought terrifies me. Currently, I have $17,931.87 in credit card debt. In late spring earlier this year, I opened a balance transfer card to send some of my debt over there, in the hopes of avoiding paying more interest on it. As you will see, that didn't come to fruition, and I've ended up gathering more debt since then...

This has all accumulated on top of my student loans for a number of reasons: cost of living increased much more than I expected, unexpected car troubles/emergencies hit me that I was unprepared for, and during both of my summers in between years of school, I was working away from home, unable to sub-let my apartment, and without student loans in the summer to help buoy me, was paying to live in a different city for work while also having to maintain my apartment at home. I ended up being unable to save anything from either of these two summer jobs, had to rely on credit cards to just pay rent/utilities/travel expenses/etc., and now, here I am. Drowning in debt, suffocating, feeling like there is no end in sight.¬†I'm not trying to make excuses, I know I'm in a deep hole and I need some help to get out of it.¬†


I am terrified. I am feeling so lost and helpless and ashamed. I'm depressed and suffering mild anxiety attacks, which has never happened before. I never thought this would happen to me but I don't know what to do or where to turn or what to even *start* doing now to fix anything. I hope I haven't ruined my life and my future. I need some help, please.¬†

To help out, I've tried to outline my accounts, and bills that I know I will for sure need to take care of in the coming months. I don't get another student loan deposit till January. I don't know what to do, or where to begin, or how to move forward. I feel stuck and like there's nothing I can do, but I am motivated to try something to improve my situation.

**Current Funds**:

*Checking Account* - $4117.29 (The base of this is remaining from the student loans dispersed to me in August. I've got ~$350-400 coming in every two weeks, after taxes, from the two part- time jobs I am working. But it‚Äôs never a set amount.)

881,9gmwoz,False,None,93,A little money game I like to play with myself,povertyfinance,"Last year I got very frustrated with my ex going to the bar every night while we were essentially living in poverty. His excuse was that it was ""only $5"" on his way home. Having used the 'envelope system' and other jar methods to save money before, I used his excuse as a motivator to save money. I taped up a coffee can with duct tape and poked a slit in the top of it. On an index card I wrote out a tiny calendar from then (September) to the end of the year. I decided I would ""just"" contribute $5/day for as long as I could.  Everytime I put in a $5 increment I would cross out the days. So $20 was 4 days, etc.

It seemed unmanageable, but I made more than my ex and figured I would try.

I was paid weekly so every Friday I would hit up the ATM and try to get $40 out for my jar. Obviously this is a lot of money to many of us, but I tried. In October I was offered a few days of OT and the option to come in an hour early every day, so this hour was my $5/day (I was making $12.88/hr so after taxes and etc) and any extra days was catch up money. 

Because this money was out of my account, out of sight, and possibly it represented that I was committed to not just drinking away all my money, I was able to save up enough money to leave my ex! Lol, but in all seriousness with a little luck getting OT I saved $150/mo for several months doing this when I thought it was pretty impossible.

If it's in your account, you might spend it, but even doing just $1/day (getting $20 out of the ATM every two or three weeks), you can put the money away and forget about it.  $365 in a year doesn't seem like much, but many of us have had less in our accounts this month.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm not at what anyone would consider the poverty level, but I do have a terrible habit that causes me to live paycheck to paycheck and has put me into some scary situations here and there.

I have money automatically deposited into my savings account every paycheck. I also have a certain amount that I put into a second checking account that my regular bills come out of. My primary checking is for groceries, gas, and some spending money.

So I have this HORRIBLE habit of overspending. And it‚Äôs not because I buy crap because I want it... I‚Äôm just buying things I genuinely need, like an apron so I don‚Äôt ruin my clothes when I cook (I‚Äôm messy and keto involves a lot of fatty foods lol). No, my one big spending problem is eating out. I kind of panic if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast because I don‚Äôt have time to eat lunch and breakfast ends up being my only meal until dinner.

Anyway... about this time in the pay cycle (four days until payday) I‚Äôll have to start transferring money from that savings account to my primary checking account because I only have $11 left or something. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. This is twice a month this happens. Every. Damn. Time.

But this month!!! This month I made some changes. I said no to frivolous purchases (passed on a beautiful robe on the clearance rack to replace my slightly worn one), took my lunch to work, made dinner with leftovers to spare, was a lot smarter about how much food I purchased (from a big family, hard to learn to just cook for two), and got creative with cheaper recipes like different types of salads. The biggest thing I did was say no to eating out. I‚Äôm not actually hungry, I‚Äôm just not planning ahead and panicking when I think I won‚Äôt eat for the rest of the day.

What‚Äôs amazing is that I didn‚Äôt actually sacrifice that much! I was able to spend $50 on new workout pants and bras. I took my boyfriend out for a drink on Easter Sunday. I even bought myself a Starbucks.

And here I am, sitting on $52.81 for the rest of the week!  THIS FEELS AMAZING! Just those changes made a massive difference! I actually kept what I put aside in my savings account (I officially have $405 now). And I don‚Äôt need to spend that whole $52.81. I know I can make some of the veggies from last week go into meals this week and I have lots of deli meat, eggs, and bacon left. So I plan to grocery shop for what I need for the week and if I have any money remaining, it‚Äôs going into that savings account... and then I‚Äôm going to do the same thing this next paycheck.

891,bic16u,False,None,192,I'm not going to tell my husband about the money I just got.,povertyfinance,"Kind of long, TL;DR at the end. 

For some background, we're poor. Until both of our kids are in school next year and I can go back to work, we're a family of 4 living on just my husband's income. He makes better than minimum wage and we're in an area where cost of living is dirt cheap, but we're still working with less than $30,000/yr. We live very frugally, we only have the necessities and basically every cent we have goes towards bills or caring for our children. 


Because I'm currently a SAHM, I try to help my little sister by babysitting for her so she doesn't have to quit her job. She doesn't make much, but it's better than nothing. She usually pays me by just picking up whatever small stuff I need for the house. A pack of diapers here, a jug of laundry detergent there, you get the idea. 


So, yesterday we celebrated a late Easter with all the kids and they had a blast. Well, my sister surprised me with a basket even though I didn't expect anything. It was so sweet of her, she got my favorite candy and a few skeins of yarn, just really thoughtful, you know? She also gave me $600, which I did NOT expect. I was pretty floored, because that's a pretty big amount of money for all of us. It's not  exactly something we're pulling out of the couch cushions. It's literally our rent and electric bill this month. It is a significant gift that my sister gave me. 


I know I should spend that money on bills. There's always something that needs to be paid, or the car fixed, the kids have birthdays coming up... there's just always much that I could use that money for. And I decided to not tell my husband about it. He's not the best with money. I mean, he's not out blowing rent on dumb shit, but if we have a spare $20, he can't not spend it so I'm usually in charge of the money. 


I have decided to not tell him about this gift, and surprise him by buying us a new bed with that money. We've needed a new bed for years, we've talked about it so many times but it's always at the bottom of our priorities list because we won't die without it and the kids are always outgrowing clothes. I want to do something for us for once. I don't even remember the last time we had something new, just because. And I want a new bed. I'm tired of us working our asses off and waking up sore and not fully rested. We deserve something nice for ourselves for once. And I'm gonna do it. I'm not telling him because he'll remind me that there's other, more important things. But those other things are always there. The opportunity for a new bed, however, is not one I'm willing to pass up. 


TL;DR my sister gifted me a substantial amount of money and I'm not telling my husband about it so I can buy us a new bed instead of spending it on something ""more important"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bic16u/im_not_going_to_tell_my_husband_about_the_money_i/,943,"Whatever you do, buy it from amazon because you can always return it if you‚Äôre unsatisfied.

I had to buy a suit and have it rush-altered in time for my grandfather's funeral. I was due for new glasses/contact lenses, and required a pretty pricey prescription, and my insurance didn't cover nearly as much as I was expecting. All in all, I had about $1,000 in expenses that I wasn't expecting. It more than wiped out my savings, and for the first time in a few years, I couldn't pay my credit card balance down to $0 before the statement posted. 

The past month and a half has been lean as I've been trying to climb out of the hole. I've eaten a lot of the same meals over and over again, cleaned out my fridge and pantry to make sure not to spend any more than I had to, and cancelled plans because worrying about the cost outweighed the fun I would have.

But payday is on Tuesday, and that will bring me back to the black, with enough to get me through until next payday on an only slightly reduced budget. Unless, of course, my upcoming doctor appointment ends up costing more than I expected, which it definitely will.

Like I said, it's been tough. However, I will acknowledge that I'm in a better spot than many of the people I see posting here. I'm healthy and single with no kids, have a separate bank account for housing repairs, and another for student loan payments, that I could have dipped into if I saw no way out.

There are two adults in my household, 28F and 29m. I've been easily able to manage this budget over the past couple years, but in the past 3-4 months I feel like food prices have been inching up and everything is starting to get really tight. FWIW, we buy very few non-food items each month, so it's really food costs that are squeezing us.

I buy basic staples (dry beans, rice, bread ingredients, oats, eggs, ground beef, chicken breasts, fresh produce, etc.) and always look for sales. But sales for these items are hard to come by and it's getting depressing looking through store ads now when 90% of it is processed junk. All my staples are sitting on shelves at full price, or the sales seem ridiculous ($3/lb for non-organic apples *on sale*?).

Every week, I shop the three grocery stores close to me (Sprouts, Kroger, Safeway) for lowest prices and will go to other stores like Trader Joe's for a few items the others don't have. Wish we had an Aldi; I think that'd be a huge help.

I've started cutting back on items I used to enjoy and I've been rationing meat way more to spread it out. I've started having 'bean weeks' where I cook up a huge pot of beans and get creative with recipes, because these are so cheap. A lot of the old recipes I used to make and really like are gathering dust because obtaining the ingredients to make even a couple of these per week would easily push us over budget.

I guess I'm just venting or looking for commiseration or something. Every week when I do meal planning it gets me down how much mental energy I'm putting into this just to stay in budget.

916,993l7b,False,None,140,Borrowing your way out of generational poverty.,povertyfinance,"My whole family has been poor going pretty far back. Recent history is my grandparents were born deaf and discarded by society, and took crap odd jobs to make ends meet. Grandma got pregnant as a teen, my mom also got pregnant at 15, and then I myself got pregnant as a teen. I was pretty uneducated about life in general and most certainly about money, and how much money it took to raise children. I just knew you were supposed to have kids and struggle, that was life and that's just how it is. Graduating high school was optional.

When I got older,  my world view really changed. I was determined to raise my kids middle class so they could have all the things I never did. I was (still am?) pretty illiterate when it comes to money, so I borrowed my way out of poverty. I ran up all kinds of credit cards and loans to fund a middle class lifestyle. My kids got to dress in new clothes (even though they weren't name brand, they weren't hand me downs!), they got to do extra curricular activities. My husband and I moved to a decent school district, bought mid-range cars. We were so deep in debt this whole time. 

Now both of my kids are in college, and they still live at home so we can pay their living expenses while they are going to school. They are the first generation in my family to go to college right out of high school. And I'm proud of that. 

My husband and I are working hard to pay off the debt we've accumulated throughout their childhoods, but honestly I don't regret any of it. Borrowing money allowed us to get to a place where we could live in a regular house, wear regular clothes, buy regular food. And I feel like we broke the poverty cycle - now my kids are in college and are set up to get good paying jobs, and we can help them save money while living at home so they can move out when they are financially ready to. We are trying to teach them about money, and not getting into debt, but it's hard when I don't really know much myself. 

Sorry for the long post, me and my husband were just discussing it so I thought it would make a good discussion here also.

To me, and this is my own view, is that you haven't broken the poverty cycle. It's faking it, if it's a facade with all of that debt you still carry. Carrying debt for so many years is poverty. ",2018-08-21 14:26:45
917,900n2l,False,None,204,"The trades, especially plumbing, are great. Here's a detailed look if you feel like you're drowning financially.",povertyfinance,"Just a PSA for all you lovely people.

It's been said before, but the trades really are a great way to be financially stable without an education.

I just started a plumbing apprenticeship with a taxable wage of $15.19 an hour, and a take-home wage of $14.19 an hour. Every year for the next five years, I will get a roughly $2 raise. My journeyman wage will be (as of right now) $37.98 an hour. 

For those of you curious about what that looks like for a yearly salary:

* First year - $31,600
* Second year - $39,500
* Third year - $47,400
* Fourth year - $55,300
* Fifth year- $67,200
* Journeyman - $80,000

There's a lot of work involved, and there's terms and conditions.

1) You are required by the union (this one, anyway) to go to school two nights a week for three hours a night throughout the five year apprenticeship. It follows a standard school schedule, so you get summers off. You do take out a small loan for this to cover materials and training in the classroom. If you leave the union before completing your apprenticeship, you have to pay it back in full.

The good side of having to go to school is that everything you learn is immediately applicable to what you're doing in the field. It's not like taking art history just to fill your credit hours for your science degree.

2) While an apprentice, you can't do plumbing work outside the union. The logic being ""we're not paying for and training you to work outside of the union for somebody else,"" which I understand. If you're looking at a different kind of union, I'm sure they have a similar policy in place.

3) The union will not always have work for you. If you're a journeyman this isn't a big problem. As an apprentice, you can't do plumbing work outside of the union for an independent contractor or something along those lines. And you still have your apprenticeship classes even if the union doesn't have work for you. I don't know how common it is for this to happen where there's a lot of people ""on the bench,"" but it's common enough that you should have a minimum of three months savings while working in the trades.

The flip side to this is that you can get a lot of job security based off your merit and work ethic. If you work well and work hard, and don't have safety violations, a company will really try to keep you on their payroll. So, your reputation and merit make a difference, for better or for worse. It's completely up to you

4) You never know who you're going to work with. The company that hires you may not be well run. The foreman could be incompetent or an asshole. The journeyman you work with as an apprentice could be incompetent or an asshole, which means you won't learn shit from them.

5) If you're a woman entering the trades, it can be a bit intimidating. DON'T BE SCARED. So far, nobody has made any inappropriate comments to me. I've heard some ""boy talk"" fawning over a cute girl on site, but it hasn't escalated beyond that and become inappropriate. The company I was hired by has very strict harassment policies. Not all of them will, unfortunately. Where the company might not have strict policies, your coworkers will make up for it. There's a lot of comraderie involved, and the people you work with will want to have your back. The guys I work with call me their little sister. If the company sucks and your coworkers suck, you'll be respected for standing up for yourself. This isn't some bullshit retail job where you have to silently accept the abuse being thrown at you.

So, it's not a cakewalk. But, it wouldn't be any harder than trying to work two or more jobs while going to school for a degree. And there's a guaranteed pay raise every year while you learn the skills to do your job. You know exactly how much you're going to be making, indefinitely.

Plumbing has a lot of math involved. As someone who used to hate math, it's not as bad as it sounds. If you have good problem solving skills, or are good at puzzles, plumbing might be a good fit.

Everything I've said in this post is based off my own observations. If anyone more experienced in the trades has any input or corrections, please feel free to add it. If you want more information on a union, simply Google search the trade and your city, ex. Bremerton Carpenters Union, Amarillo Plumbers Union, etc.

Now we have a woman posting about an incredible opportunity/program available to women‚Äîincluding non-binary and disabled women, immigrant women, and older women‚Äîand people are whining that men and those with a tech background are excluded from that program.

No shit, Sherlock. Not everyone can qualify for EVERY job. That‚Äôs how jobs work.

That doesn‚Äôt mean those aren‚Äôt genuinely great opportunities for people who ARE able qualify, or that they should be disparaged because they don‚Äôt happen to fit your specific demographic. It may be disappointing that you don‚Äôt qualify but don‚Äôt try and pull people down‚Äîfind inspiration where you can and keep a look out for your own opportunities. It‚Äôs incredibly selfish to begrudge other people the ability to succeed (in a job, in a romantic relationship, in a hobby or talent) and only be able to wish someone well if they‚Äôre worse off than you, and you don‚Äôt expect them to do better.

I see an awful lot of defeatist thinking here. People can‚Äôt possibly move for work/education opportunities due to limited finances although we see examples of people every day who move across entire countries with nothing to their name (if not in debt). People can‚Äôt improve their qualifications for a job because they have to work full time for a living‚Äîeven though there are plenty of examples of people taking classes or apprenticing on top of working full time. Yes, you give up all your free time and your life is nothing but work & study for a few years, but it‚Äôs not impossible. 

No it‚Äôs not fair that so many other people don‚Äôt even have to consider these sacrifices, and are able to get a great education/career/etc without risking anything. That‚Äôs how it should be for everyone but it‚Äôs not. 

But refusing to do what you CAN because you think you shouldn‚Äôt have to‚Äîeven if that‚Äôs true‚Äîis just insisting on failure and that‚Äôs baffling to me.

It‚Äôs fine to say that you‚Äôre just not willing to put forth a certain amount of effort. The amount of work that is required of some of us to just get on the same footing as others is overwhelming and often beyond what any human should be expected to be willing to do. And that‚Äôs understandable. There have been things I passed on because I just felt it would take more than I was willing to give (or entail more discomfort than I was willing to bear) to do them.

But we should know when we do this that these things are NOT ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù and that we are turning them down by choice. 

Some people will never be able to catch a break even if they try. But refusing difficult opportunities by insisting that no one can succeed is the best way to make sure you don‚Äôt.

921,ae1qmm,False,None,243,"Remember a few months ago when someone posted that you can make quick cash by selling plasma? Well, I did it and here's how it went.",povertyfinance,"**TL;DR:** Donating plasma is real - it's legit.  It takes some time out of your day, but is otherwise low-effort.

A few months ago (maybe over the summer?) someone posted that selling plasma could get you some quick cash.  Ever since then I've been meaning to do it, but kept putting it off.  Finally, I decided that the new year was a great time to stop procrastinating.

The first thing I did was a quick internet search to find out which facilities were near me.  There are two in my area: CSL and B Positive.  I didn't have a lot to go on, so I randommly chose B Positive.  It's a little bit far from my house, but very close to work so I thought that might be convenient.

I went to the B Positive website and read all the FAQs and informational pages.  I'm glad I did because there's some paperwork you have to bring with you.  You will need: a photo ID, your social security card, and proof of address.  I couldn't find my SS card, but according to the website you can also bring your W2 or 1040.  I brought my 1040 and had no problems.

The website said that first time donations take about 2.5 hours.  I arrived at the facility at 9:30 am on Saturday morning.  I needed to leave by 12:30, so I thought that would be pleny of time.

When I got there, the place was cclean and brightly lit.  The other clients were a bit rough around the edges, but I don't know what I expected - a bunch of brain surgeons and fighter pilots?  Anyway, the staff was super nice.  The front desk lady looked at my ID/paperwork and set me up as a donor.  You have to have your fingerprints taken electronically and they take your picture.  

Next you go to a computer kiosk where you log in via a finger scanner (hence the need for fingerprints) and your DOB. You have to answer a series of 52 questions.  If you've ever donated blood, the questions are really similar.  If you've ever had sex with someone who had sex with someone who had sex for drugs, in France, with Ebola while getting a tattoo with a dirty needle, you can stop reading now because they're going to reject you.

After I answered the 52 questions, I waited to be called for my physical.  This is the part where I didn't plan ahead.  It took a loooong time.  It was a busy time of day, and I waited like an hour.  Finally, I realized I wouldn't be able to finish before my 12:30 deadline, so I had to leave.  I did come back later in the afternoon, though, and it went much quicker.

So, when I came back I had to answer the 52 questions again at the kiosk, and then waited a much shorter time to be called.  My ""physician or physician's substitute"" took me to a private exam room and did the usual weight, blood pressure, temperature, etc.  She did a finger prick and had to get a tiny tube of blood to check my iron, protein, and something else I can't remember.  She asked a million questions, a lot of them repeats of the 52 kiosk questions.  She marked my finger with some invisible blacklight ink, and explained that the other place, CSL, marks a different finger - so they'll know if you're trying to double-donate.  She checked my arms for ""bruising"" (aka track marks), checked my eye dialation, felt my stomach, and asked my favorite question - ""Do you want a snack?""  Well heck yeah!  So I got some pretzles and a Powerade.  Then I had to listen to some guy read 23 statements about the process of donating and answer ""Yes"" that I understood.  That part made me feel good because I know some of the other clients are probably not the strongest readers, and by listening to the information it was assured that everyone had access to it.

Before I left that room, the physical lady gave me my Visa card and explained how to set it up and everything.  **HERE'S THE BEST PART:** they pay you according to how much you weigh and fat people get more!!!  My time has finally come!

FINALLY, I got to go back to the donation floor.  It's a giant room with rows of recliner-ish chairs.  They kind of reminded me of those zero-gravity lawn chairs you can get.  The chairs each had a USB port and a plug, so you could use your laptop or charge your phone.  There were also big screens throughout the room in case you wanted to watch TV.  I'd say there were about 40 seats?  The whole thing looked very dystopian, but very clean and legit.

I was directed to a specific seat and the person in charge of that section came over and prepped me for donation.  They verify your name and DOB.  YOu can choose which arm you wan to use - I gave from my left the first time.  They rub you down with iodine and then jab you with the needle.  It was a slight pinch, but not painful at all.  Then they start the machine running.  You have a blood pressure cuff on and while the cuff is tight you're supposed to squeeze and release your fist - that's when the blood is coming out.  When the cuff loosens, you don't have to squeeze any more - that's when the leftovers are getting put back in.  The machine cycles through the whole time you're hooked up.  Once you're done, the person removes the needle and puts some gauze on the site (at my place they wrap it liek a hundred times with bright tape, so if you like attention you can definitely get some!)  The they make you sit up for a few minutes and drink another Powerade.  Finally they let you get up and leave.  The donation part probably took an hour all together on my first try.

From start to finish the staff was **incredibly** nice. 
 Afterwards I felt perfectly fine.  I did drink more water as per the instructions, but didn't have any problems.  Later that night I checked the Visa card balance and sure enough there was 50 buckaroos on it!

That was all on Saturday.  Today I went for my second donation after work.  I went straight to the 52-question kiosk and that checks you in.  Your name appears on a big screen in the waiting area - like an arrivals board at the airport.  I didn't wait long at all, then went back for a mini-health screening (weight, temp, blood pressure, finger prick, check your fingers with a blacklight and re-mark you.)  From there I went to the donation floor and got hooked up.  Today it actually took 2 hours from start to finish, but I don't think that's typical and I'm pretty sure it was my fault.  I think I moved my arm and jostled the needle so I was less ""flowy.""  People who came in after me finished before me.  My best estimate is that you can probably get in and out in a little over an hour.

All in all, whoever wrote that original post was right - donating plasma is easy and you get cash money. AND you're helping someone who really depends on it.  There was a poster in the donation room that said it took 1200 donations per year to treat *one* patient with hemophilia.  That's crazy!

936,az4be7,False,None,282,Can I just have a rant?,povertyfinance,"Would love some like minded folks to understand where I'm coming from. This YouTube video I saw yesterday has had my head spinning.

This guy posted about ""Why he chooses to live in a $50k a year apartment.""

It was not a jealous rage click. Especially when it's not a ""Look at how much money I make. And I'm better than you"" video that seems to be flooded on YouTube lately. 

I clicked because it sounded interesting. I was hoping for a video about features of the apartment. Why it's so expensive. Why he chose it.

He spent 30 seconds on that. And all he mentioned was location, and hardwood flooring and his pool table.

It then turned into a 12-15 minute lecture on ""Don't be poor"".

This man had his parents help throughout all of college. Started working for *Google* at a young age, in some well paying tech position. He said that everyone needs to live at home with their parents. Swallow their pride and just do it until they have enough money saved up.

Which I was letting slide. It was annoying that he was presenting this as something everyone can do. As I was very lucky to live with my parents again in the past couple years. After previously not being able to. Not everyone has that option. And I was miffed that he couldn't see past his own experiences. But moved on. Hoping he'd get back to the apartment. The thing stated in the title.

No. He goes on to say the biggest barrier to living with your parents is the stigma. And people will think you're a loser. This man is so disconnected from how real conversations work that it hurts.

Gems from the video:

""Already have quite a few thousand dollars saved up after just a few months of living with your parents.""

""Anyone can travel. You just have to want it bad enough.""

""If you want to travel. Just live with your parents.""

""All world travellers live with their parents.""

""Doing laundry for one person is hard.""

""You owe it to your parents to take care of them in their old age."" 

No shade to people who plan to take care of their parents. But he completely ignored abusive parents. Parents who disowned  their children or kicked them out over being LGBT+ or atheist or not wanting kids or not agreeing to a certain marriage.

Ignored that people may have their own families. And don't have the resources to spare. Or may not have the financial means to take care of their parents. Or may not be in great health themselves. Or simply just don't have the spoons. Or simply don't want to.

Your parents are not entitled to your help in their old age. It is a nice thing if you can. But don't feel bad if you don't want to or want to but simply can't.

He straight up ignored all of these. We all owe it to our parents. Regardless of the situation.

More gems:

""I get that $80,000 a year is a lot. That's a full time job said for some people."" Said in a way that he clearly believes that 80k is some sort of lower standard for the average American

I watched the video to the end. Hoping for a *tiny* shred of self awareness. Anything. Even just a token ""I understand not everyone can do this.""

Nope. Nothing. So I had to say something. I commented this (which is so much less than everything I wanted to say).

""I understand you mean well. But you presented your life as the standard for Americans. Your life is not the standard. So many people, fellow Americans. Do not have many of the opportunities you have, do not have good family members. Some people are abused by their parents. Some people are disowned for being LGBT+. Lots of people lost their safe and comfortable jobs in the '08 crash. Regardless of education or experience. Millions of American college graduates are underemployed or unemployed. It's incredibly hard to move to a better place with opportunity when you don't have the money in the first place, and a lot of companies don't want to take a chance on you when you don't have any experience and you're not already in the area. You seem to be a very critical thinker, but I fear you were not thinking about other people's situations. There are so many Americans struggling, and your video comes across as dismissive and naive.Ôªø""

This man works for *google*. A company that at least tries to be a little forward thinking and progressive. And he's so uneducated of the situation that millions of Americans are in. For example. This absolutely telling study.

""Nearly 80 percent of American workers (78¬†percent) say they're living paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2017 report by employment website CareerBuilder.¬†""

I was a little skeptical at a survey done by career builder, because I feel like it would be skewed due to the people usually on the site. I found their press release and they shared their survey methodology:¬†

Survey Methodology
This survey was conducted online within the U.S. by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among 2,369 hiring and human resource managers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) and 3,462 employees ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government)¬†between May 24 and June 16, 2017¬†(percentages for some questions are based on a subset, based on their responses to certain questions). With pure probability samples of 2,369 and 3,462, one could say with a 95 percent probability that the overall results have sampling errors of +/- 2.01 and +/- 1.67 percentage points, respectively.¬†Sampling error for data from sub-samples is higher and varies.

So yea. That video had me very miffed. And was a bunch of ""Don't be poor"" coming from someone who doesn't understand that he's had situations that many Americans would consider themselves lucky to have. And I did not expect to be slammed with an ignorant person lacking *any* self awareness when I clicked on a simple video.

945,b0ppvi,False,None,106,Fabrication shops,povertyfinance,"I've been lurking on povertyfinance for a while, and I'd like to mention something that has worked for me, and worked for my brother in law... and could work for many of you. I see posts where people work in various retail, food service, or even office jobs, and there's nothing wrong with that at all. But I don't see anyone talking about machine shops and fabrication shops. I'm in the US, and there are absolutely still manufacturing jobs in the US, despite what you may hear in the media or other places.

I'll tell my story, where I left a 12 hour per day, seven day per week (and sometimes all night) job, and entered an interesting field of work with no references, no experience, and no idea that *such a job was even something that was scientifically possible.* 

I had an interview with a shop in Tulsa that did work for various companies - oil and gas, aerospace, defense, etc. They had brakes (Large machines that bend metal sheets/plates) rolls (Machines which roll plates into cylinders) welders, and...

...Lasers. Lasers which cut metals, up to 1 1/4"" (32mm) thick. I didn't know that was a thing until that day. I was decent at math, could read calipers and a tape measure, and could read prints. They hired me. I was put on a CNC plate laser (Which cuts flat material) and a young guy was tasked with training me... Young guy wasn't a good trainer, but he was good at being useless, rude, and often high. So I figured the machine out myself, after a bit of trial and error. I worked there for about a year, then when I noticed that I wouldn't ever be paid more than what I was making, I went off in search for another job. With Laser experience, it wasn't hard. Ended up at a complete shithole for about two months running a burntable, (Oxyfuel torches, cnc controlled, cutting plate up to 3"" thick) and got another laser job for a little more money. Worked there for a while, but was working six days a week. I fixed a few issues they were having with their laser and it's programming. I found another job willing to pay me $2 more per hour to start, and I put in my notice - they begged for two weeks for me to stay, but wouldn't budge on the ""We work until we're done"" 16+ hour per day, six days per week nonsense. So I went on to a great shop, running a well-maintained Amada plate laser. Around this time, my brother in law was working retail, and was being told by his mom and the she-beast that was his wife that he could never, ever get a better job. I got him a job as a shop helper. He learned to run a brake, and the plasma table. More importantly, he realized that he *could* operate these machines, no matter what a bunch of unemployed people in his life were telling him. 

After two years in that shop, they started to have trouble paying people, so I left before I ended up working for free. Went to a shop that made air components (valves, controls, etc) for machinery, and learned to run a punch press. Not a bad place, and wish I'd stayed there sometimes, but the boss critter was a real problem. Ended up in ANOTHER place that had a few flat lasers, and as I had started to figure out - if you can run a laser in Tulsa, unemployment is something that happens to other people. The same can be said for a plasma operator, brake, roll, mill, or lathe operator. My brother in law has no trouble finding jobs now, and makes more money than he could have in retail. 

I work in a place now running a tube laser (cuts steel structural sections like I-beam, angle, square tube, rectangle tube, and pipe) and while not every day is sunshine and bunny farts, I have job security, I don't have to deal with customers, and in the past several years (This saga started in 2012) I have learned several different CNC controllers, several different lasers, laser maintenance and repair, drafting, 3d modeling in Solidworks, Inventor, and Fusion 360, G-code, and an embarrassing amount of CNC programming. 

So don't be afraid to go talk to someone at a steel shop, even if you don't know what you're doing. If you can show up every day, sober, and are willing to learn, you will learn to do something amazing, and you will start to see things that *you have made* popping up around you. 

EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I'm sorry I've not been able to answer everyone's comments - worked a 12 today. I hope that I helped open everyone's mind to the idea that working with your hands and your mind is something most people can get into, that is rewarding in more ways than just financially.

Hi. My name is Ariana Tobin and I'm a journalist at the nonprofit accountability outlet ProPublica ([propublica.org](https://propublica.org)).  We would love your help with a new investigation into a pattern we think is hurting lower income people.

Did you expect to receive a big tax refund, but then didn‚Äôt get it because you were audited by the IRS? [Here's what the letter might look like](https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/irs-audit-earned-income-tax-credit-refund-help).  The biggest tax credit is called the Earned Income Tax Credit. It‚Äôs mainly for people who work and have kids to take care of. It‚Äôs aimed at people who earn under $40,000 a year.

The IRS audits a lot of people who claim this credit. When that happens, the IRS blocks the refund. Some people may actually end up owing tax instead of getting a refund. We particularly would love to hear from you ‚Äì we don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre alone, and we're trying to find as many people as we can to shed some light on who gets hurt.

Happy to answer any questions about what we do and why we're looking into this.¬†I'm [ariana.tobin@propublica.org](mailto:ariana.tobin@propublica.org) and my colleague [Paul Kiel](https://www.propublica.org/people/paul-kiel) is [paul.kiel@propublica.org](mailto:paul.kiel@propublica.org).

947,8hq3li,False,None,111,Preparing For A Baby: A Single Mom's Guide,povertyfinance,"At the end of 2015. I found myself pregnant with my now 20 month old son. It was not planned, I was not in a position to rely on my son's father, and I've always been poor. I did have a full-time job, a beater car, and an affordable rental home but almost no cash or resources to spare in preparing for my first child. I thought I'd write up a post that may help other women (or fathers/couples!) in a similar situation and explain some of the things I did or learned along the way that really helped me. 


1) I applied for pregnancy Medicaid. I received this immediately and it covered ALL of my routine ob/gyn visits as well as almost the entire labor and delivery. I  had an emergency c-section and ended up staying in the hospital with my son for 9 days. Medicaid covered almost the entire bill; I ended up owing about $200 after the hospital stay but the hospital I delivered at had a financial program for low-income women (you have to ask!!) so my final out-of-pocket cost was $40. Absolutely amazing considering what it costs to have a baby and I was able to attend all appointments and never thought twice about having to see my doctor unexpectedly for issues along the way. All of my prescriptions during pregnancy and for three months afterwards, were absolutely free so ask your doctor to prescribe prenatal vitamins. You should take them anyway but buying them OTC is expensive so get them free from the pharmacy by telling your doctor you need a prescription because of cost. It does seem though that the quality/availability of care through Medicaid is very dependent on your geographical location as I've spoken with other mothers who did not have such an easy or good time with pregnancy Medicaid. Talk to your case manager when you sign up and ask about your best options. It really pays to do your own research as the system is usually really overwhelmed and your case manager only has so much time/effort/care they can give you.  Also, sign up for WIC and SNAP right NOW. 


2) Lean on your family and friends. Everyone loves a new baby! I was very, very fortunate in that I have an incredible, supportive family. My sister bought me so many gifts that I'm not sure I could of done it without her. My dad assembled so much baby equipment and furniture for me that it was basically a second job for him. Cousins, aunts, co-workers, friends all bought gifts. Do not be shy about accepting them or telling them exactly what you need if they ask. Which leads me to number 3.


3) Have a baby shower. If you don't have anyone close enough to you that will throw one for you, plan it yourself. It absolutely does not have to cost a ton of money. You can make cheap but good foods like cold pasta salad and hamburgers; just host it at your home or in a public park (weather permitting of course) to save on a party hall rental. I know this seems like a social sin to throw your own baby shower but you have to do what you have to do and most people won't care anyway. People will bring gifts so I would highly suggest creating a registry. When I was pregnant , babies r us was still around and they had a million options at a million price points. They even gave you a gift card worth 10% of the final amount of things bought off your registry a few months after your due date so search around online for the store offering the best options for deals near you. Even if you don't have a shower, create a registry at any store that offers incentives. Add the items you're going to purchase for yourself and then buy them off the registry to get the incentives. 


4) STOCKPILE. I knew I would not be paid for any type of maternity leave so I began buying supplies I knew I'd need immediately to have them on hand when I was out of work after my son's birth. This GREATLY reduced my financial burden and the accompanying stress because I didn't have to worry about diapers, wipes, etc. Every month of my pregnancy, I bought at least one jumbo box of diapers and one jumbo box of wipes. I also suggest buying bulk sale items when you come across them and have the extra money. I have not bought diaper rash cream, baby lotion/shampoo/soap, or baby sunscreen since I was pregnant because I still have stockpiles of it and my son is now 20 months. I managed this by buying a ton of it whenever I came across a good sale. You will always end up using it and most products have a very long shelf-life. If an item(s) is very heavily discounted and you know for certain that you will need it but not for 9 months or so, I'd buy it as long as you can store it. It's also helpful to stock up on children's Tylenol and such because when you live alone, there is no one you can send to the store at 2 am when baby has a teething fever. 


5) Buy what you can second-hand and then resell it when you no longer need it. Bassinets, pack-and-plays, clothes, etc. Browse thrift stores and places like Once Upon A Child very frequently because they get new items often and you have to be quick when something good comes in. Buy clothes in sizes 1-2 up when you come across good deals on them because you're going to need them soon anyway. I bought my son clothes all the way up until size 12 months when I was pregnant and never had to buy any the first year of his life. Also try Facebook marketplace, Craig's List, and friends with growing children. Do not worry about fancy equipment like electric bottle warmers or lace dresses, buy basic. If baby is clean, fed, and well looked after, it does not matter if his outfit is trendy or if you have a baby wipe warmer. I had never been around babies so I solicited the advice of a million different websites and almost every parent I came across. Gather information about what you'll really actually need and use vs. what you want or are not sure about.


6) Sign up for coupons. Companies love to throw coupons and the occasional free item at new parents. Sign up for formula coupons (I know for sure that both enfamil and similac offer them) even if you plan on breastfeeding. They'll bombard your mailbox with good sized samples and substantial coupons. Look online for rewards programs like the one Pampers offers, too. Sign up for all of it. This is questionably ethical but I also had my sister sign up for the same coupons using her address and my due date. I was able to use twice the amount of coupons this way. 

7) Find out about subsidized daycare. There may be a waiting list so see if you can get on it now and research the daycares that accept it. Research and apply for every single social program available BEFORE baby arrives. 

8) This last part is mostly for the women who are doing it alone like me. Do not be scared to ask for help whenever you need it. I was and I suffered. I look back now and wish I just would of spoken up. If you need a break (and you will) from baby, please reach out to someone you trust who can babysit for a few hours while you take a nap or do something for yourself. Do not burn yourself out because your mental health and parenting skills will suffer. Look into mommy groups, talk with other women online, see a therapist, whatever you need to do. I have found that most of the women in my situation are desperate for friends who understand what they go through so find some. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed. Ever. These things happen, we do what we need to in order to survive, and we love our children. PM me if you need to talk. Pursue child support adamantly. The state will file for you if you receive assistance but you really have to stay on top of them to actually achieve anything. Also, don't rely too heavily on the child support. Think of it as extra cash because if you end up losing it or never getting it or whatever, it won't hurt your finances so badly. Caring for a baby alone is SO FUCKING HARD and if it ever gets easier, I'll be sure to let you know but it is possible to do it. 


Edit: This is getting some attention so I wanted to add one more bit of advice. If you haven't put any effort into it before, it's now the time to construct a plan for financial longevity. For me personally, this meant education. Be honest with yourself about the amount of effort you are really willing and able to put in so that your plans/goals are achievable and grounded in reality. It's great to dream big but don't end up racking up debt in an attempt to get a BA in your childhood dream field of philosophy only to drop out after two semesters because life is hard (it is!) or eventually graduate with hefty loans with no job prospects. Don't put it off either. It's going to be really difficult but it's going to be difficult in our type of situation anyway so try to do something that will put you in a better earning position within a few years.

957,cvp92o,False,None,176,My example. How I went from poor to not poor,povertyfinance,"I am sorry that this post has a lot about me. This is not meant to be a humble brag. Instead, I hope that at least one person can get some value from this. My background is just meant to give context.

I grew up dirt poor. My father was highly intelligent but was a ‚Äú the grass is greener on the other side‚Äù guy. He switched jobs a lot. He had one year in college before dropping out. My mother did not graduate high school. 

I grew up in a run down house in rural California (yes, there is a rural California). The town I grew up near was the drug gateway into Los Angeles. It had one Sheriff. In the 70s and 80s the Hells Angels warehoused their drugs there. In the late 80s 90s they were pushed out by cartels. 

I grew up in a two bedroom hovel. We only had a tub that had fallen through the rotted floor of the one bathroom. We often went without electricity and water. We rarely had trash service. I grew up taking the trash out to the backyard and throwing it into a pile. A pile that became taller than I was. Rodents and cats would tear open the bags and spread the trash around. It was common to find piles of maggots infesting the garbage stack. 

My mother had a mental illness and suffered from severe depression. She had to have a tumor removed that was the size of a basketball. After that surgery she was bed ridden because of her undiagnosed depression.

This all seemed normal to me, because, I did not know any different. I didn‚Äôt know that most people did not have ceiling collapsing inside their homes. I did not know that when it rained not everyone had to grab buckets to collect the rain water that came through the leaky ceiling.

I was pretty self sufficient from a young age. I did my own laundry, and scrounged for my meals. I got myself ready for school. In many ways I raised myself. Like many poor kids I lived on hot dogs and bologna. Most meals consisted of toast with gravy on it. 

College was never talked about in our house. College was for rich kids. School was not even that important. It was just a place that I could get a .20 cent lunch. I was always in trouble for fighting. I took out my frustrations on other people. I had the most detentions and suspensions of all my peers. This happened even through high school. I was threatened with expulsion many times. All of the staff and resource officers knew me.

My senior year of high school I had a 1.8 GPA. I was also missing a few core classes. The school made me take night classes at the adult education campus. I ended up graduating with a 2.0 exactly.

I spent two years after high school working low paying jobs. I was homeless and stayed at wherever someone would let me. I slept on a lot of couches and floors. I got into drugs. I frequented crappy strip clubs. 

After 9/11 I joined the military. I had dyed blonde hair, nipple piercings, and was covering myself in tattoos. I was a freak.

When I took the Asvab I scored two points away from max. This surprised me. It was the first time I had really done something even slightly impressive. I went in as an Aircraft electrician. During AIT I had the highest grades of all of the classes during that training cycle. I was the Distinguished Honor graduate.

While in the military I took a few community college classes. I carried a pretty high gpa and made the Dean‚Äôs List every semester. 

After the military I went to work and college at the same time. I had a wonderful wife and young kids. I worked during the day and went to school at night. It took me another two years to earn an Associates. It took me seven years to get a Bachelors. It took me another three years to earn a Masters. 

Meanwhile I worked as a mechanic. I became a Master Mechanic. I have never made over a $100,00 in a W2 job. In fact I probably made around $30,000 to $40,000 most years.

While going to school my wife and I financed two new fancy vehicles. We ran up $25,000 in credit cards, I took out $30,000 in student loans that was not always spent on school. My wife had to work nights. I had to take online courses. We were digging ourselves a hole.

One day I was switching stations on the radio. I came across Dave Ramsey and listened to him. His advice seemed stupid-simple. I told my wife about Dave and we both jumped in with the goal of being debt free.

We took both of our cars down to Carmax and sold them. Luckily we broke even between the two. We literally ate rice and beans and threw every penny at debt. It took us two years to become debt free. I drove a really old teal Mazda 323. My wife drove an old Mazda Mpv mini van that was this horrible shade of purplish-blue.

Once we were debt free everything became easier. I put a lot of money into my 401k. My wife became a stay at home mom. I kept earning better degrees and found myself making a whopping $72,000 per year. 

We ended up moving and rented out our old house. We bought another house for a crazy low interest rate. Our rental property was cash flow positive.

I started a side business while working for an employer. It is a service based local business. I started it with a partner. I cashed out my 401k of $78,000. My partner was supposed to do the work while I performed the administrative functions and financed the business. My employer ended up firing me for having a side business. His reason was ‚Äúif you had told me I would have wanted to be a part of it‚Äù.

My partner was a liar. 

A year after starting the business I found that my partner had squandered tens of thousands of dollars. He ended up getting a lawyer and threatening to sue me. Meanwhile the business was crashing and burning. I settled with my partner for an amount that I could not really afford.

Everything I had was at risk. At this point I had borrowed over a $100,000 for the business. I could not sleep during the weekends. I remember thinking that my two choices were to go crazy or fix this. I couldn‚Äôt go crazy because I still had young kids.

So, I showed up two hours early everyday and stayed late every night. I focused on ‚ÄòI need to do one thing everyday to make the business better‚Äô. Meanwhile I had a handful of customers threatening to sue me over my previous partners actions. I was getting demand letters every month. 

I just kept moving forward. Trying to do one thing better. Putting out fires as needed. 

Three years later I bought out another small business. Today, we have multiple locations. I am involved as a partner with a handful of new businesses. I directly manage a handful of businesses. I own rental properties. My net-worth is skyrocketing. 

My business debt is paid off except the debt I have against assets. 

I am 41 years old and I consider myself retired. I have managers that manage aspects of my business. I sit in my office and mentor my high-potential, high-value management staff.

So, how did I go from a 2.0 to this? More importantly how can you go from where you are to your own version of success?

Education: people get paid for what they do. People get paid more for what they know. People that continually learn and apply that learning no matter what age they are get paid the most. People that take what they learn and apply it independently of an employer create their own job security. 

Control: control what you can control. Don‚Äôt pay much attention to what you cannot control. I could not control my partner‚Äôs actions. The sooner I metabolized that fact and moved forward the better it was for me. 

Options: most people‚Äôs version of success is based around options. You may think that I should substitute being debt-free for options. The fact is that being debt free just increases your options. What I have learned in my life is that options are the only thing that separates the impoverished from those that are not. If I need to move I can move. If I need to close a business, I can close a business. If I need cash, I can come up with cash. If a business deal comes my way I can pull resources to become part of that deal.

I tell my young daughters that everything they do in life, every choice they make, should be based around which one gives them the most options. With options comes power over the unexpected. Life is not about money....it is about options. However, money usually goes hand in hand with options. 

I love my poor people out there. I just want you to know that you can not only do what I did, but, you can do it better.

To put it mildly, I was spending way way too much money at Subway for dinner or grabbing a quick coffee at Starbucks because ""oh it's only $5!"" Or grabbing Wendy's because their 4 for $4 was enough to last me two whole meals. 

So I made a bet with myself. I only had classes on Monday and Tuesday of this week. And yeah, it was hard. That Starbucks was sooo tempting. But I stayed strong! I haven't spent ANY money on fast food since last Friday! Granted, Thanksgiving being on Thursday and having enough leftovers to last me until Monday or so has helped, but I am kinda proud of myself. My roommate has complained all week about being hungry and wanting fast food and I didn't cave in and offer to run to McDonald's for her. I've essentially cleaned out our small pantry and ""shopped"" our freezer to make my meals before the feast was had on Thursday.

I still live at home, and my parents have made it clear I can leave when im ""ready"" to live on my own. I don;t have much interests in anything, so naturally I save up a lot of money because I don't know what to do with it. I pay rent ($100 month) also have been working at a restaurant as a busser/busboy for 3 years now, and have saved up a total of 21k, yes you read that right $21,000, my money only goes towards rent and gas.   
I have looked at some cashier jobs pay around 8-10 dollars starting, my parents also own rental property and one of them is a trailer which I can rent for about 11-1,200 dollars a month. Theoretically If i get a cashier job that pays 8 or 9 dollars and hour, work 10 hours 5 days a week, can I even put money away to save?  
I don't watch TV, I have a pre-paid phone, I spend $100 a year just for the service days (never run out of data or text because I never use it)  
Food, I don't eat meat anymore, I live off of peanut/peantbutter products.  
Car insurance...I can stay under my fathers insurance until I become 26 so its actually semi affordable, and I used to pay $250 every 3 months to my father but the company stopped sending the bill for my truck but is under my fathers name for insurance purposes? Its kinda of a confusing story. Its also $60 to fill a tank but I go to shell station and a shell card so I get sometimes 8-14 dollars back depending on price of gas.   


Heat, I don't use it, never have, if its cold I put a sweatshirt on. Same with AC, just user a box fan.  


I know there are a few others, water, electrical sewer etc, it seems like a big problem is the car insurance, when I went to see if I could afford my own, cheapest one was $7k a year, $3.600 every 6 months...yikes because I am under 26.   
Can I apply for governmental assistance? I don't really know how it is in my state but, in school I was in the (SPED) classes for what its called a ""learning disability"" that is the technical term for it.  
Also my brother works at a company where I can make $20 and hour by cleaning tubes, he works as a wielder for General Electric.  
Am I missing anything? It is possible? I just spend my free time reading books and sometimes playing video games/browsing on my gaming computer that I really don't use anymore.

EDIT: Wow did not expect this at all thank you all
I don't just eat peanut butter I eat wide varieties of vegetables and take many vitamins, I just use peanuts products as a snack my bad, also the heat yeah what I mean is I don't turn the heat up if I'm cold, it just stays at a temperature to keep the pipes from not freezing.

In the summer of 2013 I was delivering pizzas with a BA in polisci/sociology. My gf (now wife) was bringing home about $400/wk and we were over $15k in CC debt. One day I was offered a job as a hospital security guard, full time pay plus (shitty) benefits so if course I accepted. The only catch was it was the overnight shift but what choice did I have? 

In a strange sort of coincidence, 1 month into that job my wife totaled her car (no injuries). It dawned on us then that with her working days and me on nights we didn't need 2 cars. Huge $$ saver!. 

5 months into the security job I applied for and got a job within that hospital on the adult psychiatry unit (night shift). The increase in pay was substantial and the benefits were SO GOOD that my wife and I got married A YEAR EARLY just so she could get on my benefits! That was 5 years ago and last week I was promoted, same hospital, still on the night shift and will be getting another substantial increase in pay.

We still only need 1 car, my wife has since changed careers and we had our 1st baby last March. $1000 in savings, some CC debt but just looking back it's crazy to see how things have changed.

961,fu8txw,False,Success/Cheers,123,Feeling like an adult - just bought life insurance,povertyfinance,"I just purchased disability insurance, critical Illness insurance and life insurance. After a life of poverty and struggling I feel like an adult now. We are finally getting on our feet and it feels so nice to have a peace of mind if something happens.

Right now since we are young (30) the disability and CI insurance is more valuable to us than the life insurance.  If we fall Ill or become disabled we can draw from that. The one I picked we would get $1400/month if that were to happen.

Overall - I feel amazing. I'm happy to know if something happens my family is safe. Without my boyfriend income we would be screwed without my child care/cooking/cleaning etc we would be screwed. 

We surpassed our first goal - save 1k - then our second goal save 2k - we're on the third goal now. Honestly I feel safer as a result of getting insurance over having savings.  

It was a fraction of the cost too. They can work with your budget. We were comfortable with $200/month total - for $500 000 policy.  They say 10x your income is standard. We will re-evaluate when we have more debt/assets.  Right now I have 0 debt and 1 asset so 500k is fine. 

Anyone looking into getting it **do it** I highly recommend. It may be cheaper than you think!

Edit: Sorry all - to clarify my breakdown goes like this :

$50/month for life insurance,  CI & disability 
$50/month into tax free savings
X 2 for two people = $200/month
I have the kind that you can borrow against down the road. 

We have 0 debt so $500k is fine for us. We will re-evaluate when we have more assets and debt.

Our critical Illness and disability insurance is more valuable to us because we're still young.

Second edit: we're both smokers. I guess that's pretty important to know lol my bad

Third edit since I'm seeing a lot of questions about it: we have term insurance.

Also, whole life insurance is *essential* even though most of you have life insurance covered through work (very expensive term policy).  

What a lot of people don't understand is that once you retire, so does your insurance plan, and you're still 20 years from the average age of death. You'll have to apply for life insurance as a 59.5 year old, or pay a ridiculous premium to extend your work plan, when you could have dealt with this many years prior.

This can even effect those of us with plenty of money. It is about the mental blocks we create when we feel a scarcity in some way. so this is also a good listen for people in all kinds of situations even the middle class and wealthy. It just happens to focus on financial scarcity.

964,8hgnys,False,None,180,How I bought my house with no money down. www.naca.com,povertyfinance,"Folks,  

Someone should do a sticky on this program. It is absolutely the best program I have heard of for buying a house when you do not have money for a down payment.  I bought my first house this way.   

Here goes:

HTTP://WWW.NACA.COM is a quasi-government corporation that was set up when Bank of America got busted for doing predatory loans.

- No money down.

- No closing costs.

- Lower than average interest rate.

- They will pay your mortgage for up to 2 years if you become cash strapped, and wrap it onto the back end of your mortgage (there is a small monthly fee for this).

- They will give you extra money to buy a multi-family property since that type of property will provide you extra income (this is what I do - my rental income pays my mortgage).

- It's the best way out of poverty that I know of.

- There is a limit on how much they will lend you

- You are asked to help support the program by advocacy (what I'm doing now)

- I'm no longer in the program. 

It works like this:

1) Go to the website and sign up for a seminar if they have the program in your area.

2) At the seminar they will assign you a counselor.

3) *** You'll meet with your counselor and give them access to all your financial info, they will track your income and expenses for 3 months to a year!!!  This will determine how much money they can safely lend you.

4) Buy your house. I suggest a multi-family, it will provide you with extra income.  Over time, not only will your housing be providing you with income instead of being an expense, it will also grow in value and become your nest egg for your future.

This is 100% legit, mods, please check it out.

But I noticed that having two savings accounts forced me to match what I put in every week. I‚Äôd make it a challenge to put $25 in both instead of just my normal $25 in one. Now, almost a year later both have grown to $3,000 each and it really feels great",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/g9n1pi/what_helped_me_save_more_money/,784,"Bravo. Smart choice and really aligned with what a lot of big thinkers in this space (Nobel prize winners) have recommended - ""automatic defaults."" Good job and keep going!

Now, here's some thoughts on how to think about the future value of your savings.

Remember the rule of 72 to give you some motivation to save. Divide 72 by any Interest/Growth Rate and that's the amount of time it takes for your principal do double.

So, taking this, let's say you can get 7-10% (over the long term) in the stock market by picking an index fund and setting and forgetting it. This has generally been the case in the stock market over the last 100 years. If you divide 72 by 10% and divide 72 by 7% you get that your money will double somewhere between 7.2 - 10.2 (call it 7-10) years. So, $1,000 saved today is worth $2,000 in 7-10 years, $20,000 becomes $40,000, etc.

Here's where this math becomes powerful and can really help you see the potential of your future and help reduce your anxiety about money.

If you are 22 and you are to retire at 67 (the retirement age in the United States), you have essentially 45 years before you retire. If you take the number of years it takes your money to double (7 - 10) and divide it into your 45 years earning window, it essentially means you have between 45/10 (4.5) and 45/7 (6.4) ""doubles"" left.

So what? well, doubling (and compounding) math means essentially you take the base 2 and raise it to power.

So,

20 = 1, 21 = 2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8, 24 = 16, 25 = 32, 26 = 64

So, not counting the effect of taxes + inflation, every $1 you save today that you invest in a reasonable index fund (not any single stock) that tracks the broader stock market is worth $16 to $64 to you in retirement. Making it simple, take the 5 doubles. Every $1 you save today is worth $32 to you at the start of retirement! Then, as long as you don't take it out, your money will also continue to grow during retirement. Though, you'll want to dial down your risk as you get closer. But that's 40+ years away for someone like you.

And beware that the rule of 72 works the other way too. Get in credit card debt and divide 72 by your credit card APR and that's - generally - the number of years for your debt to double if you make minimum payments.

Good luck and keep at it! ",2020-04-28 13:20:03

Internet - do an online speed test daily, it will pretty much never be at where they promised. Call them (I usually stick to live chat, I can do it while I cook) and ask for a refund for the past 72 hours. If you are lucky enough to have competition, show them a competing rate and ask them to match it. If you're bold, set a cancellation date for a week from now, they'll call and send offers for lowered rates daily, if they don't then after a few days tell them you're not cancelling. If you think you got an apethetic support rep, hang up and try again or ask for their superior. Persistence is key.


Car insurance - it isn't too hard to get a bidding war going. Go back and forth between a few companies to see who will go the lowest just be sure they're offering the same coverage. Show each company the offer from the other as you go. There are also a lot of discounts they may not advertise outright that you can discuss with an agent - loyalty, early pay, safe driving, paperless, bundles etc. You can also ask them about courses you can take over the weekend that will lower your rate.


Credit card - call once a month and ask if they'll lower you're rate or extend your credit. It takes 10 minutes and if you're not missing payments you'll be surprised how often it pays off. 


I spend an hour or so every other Sunday haggling with whoever I owe money and it has saved me tons over the years. I actually haven't paid for Internet in 6 months if you count the gift card I got for new customers (cord cutter, no TV).

975,c4p0yo,False,None,253,"Small victories help keep me motivated, what are some of your small financial victories?",povertyfinance,"Growing up (and even to present day) my family was never good with money.  I had to learn, sometimes the hard way, how to manage my money.  Some months its harder than others, and I try to stay focused and I really rely on small victories to help me keep that motivation. My most recent small victories include not going below $100 in my checking account. I have alerts on my bank account and it will tell me when my balance drops. I have kept it above the $100 for the last 2 months!

My next small victory is kinda silly. Last year I went to a cook out and sat on the most insanely comfortable zero gravity outside chair. I was dying to have one.  They were so dang expensive (hoovering around $150ish for good quality ones).  In an effort to save $$$ this summer, I wanted to transform my backyard into a place that is relaxing and fun, so I will be more inclined to stay home instead of wanting to go out.  Well, as it happens, I was doing  my shopping at a local store and I found the exact chairs I have been pining after! They were listed for $99. It seemed like a lot, but was even cheaper than the ones i've been hanging onto online. I asked the salesman some questions about them and he told me to wait one more day, they were going on sale for 40% off! So the next day I ran to the store and got two! I never thought a chair could make me so happy LOL.

The victories are small, and meaningless to most, but it keeps me motivated to continue on with improving my financial situation.

979,8gaotm,False,None,81,Indoor gardening explained. Grow your own food with little effort and money!,povertyfinance,"Heyo fellow users! Spring is upon us in the northern hemisphere and I would like to make a post about ways for us to grow our own food. I am currently on SNAP so I know the difficulty of getting yourself fed and would like to share some knowledge I have. 

Basically, for $4 you could have 3 tubs of 2-4 (Min of 6. Max of around 12) plants each that in the first stage of fruition would yield you more than your money back. 

Disclaimer here; I do not claim to be a professional by any means, my knowledge comes from having parents that grew and canned their own food for generations and a mother who grew up in intense poverty (If they didn't grow their food, they didn't eat. This is post depression ((USA)) era poverty might I add.) 

I will be splitting this up into two segments, the first being basics to get started. The second, some protips I've found out over the years. 

**The Basics of Indoor Gardening**

*If you would like to purchase seedlings skip to the next section*

* **Let's start out with your seeds!** The cheapest I have ever found seed packets were 3 for $1 at the Dollar Tree. Sometimes you can snag a deal on packets at Walmart for a few cents cheaper. I **DO NOT** recommend Lowe's or Home Depot for seeds, they are usually overpriced. You can also find Plastic tubs to keep your plants in at Dollar Tree for a buck each.

* On to tubs to hold your plants in. I find anything plastic or metal that is around 2ft in length will hold 1-2 fully mature plants. 

* Soil? You can get it for free! If you have any wooded area's near you feel free to go with a trash bag and shovel. You can cut an old milk jug at a 45 degree angle to make a DIY scoop to get the soil quicker, don't be afraid to get your fingers dirty breaking the top layer of soil! If you prefer to get higher quality soil you are welcome learn composting or to purchase a bag from any store that sells it. 

* **This is a very important thing to remember** You will have the healthiest plants if you start with seedlings and later transfer to larger pots. For seedling holders, use any old yogurt cup, used solo cup, small paper cups, old mason jars from pasta sauce (I don't fully support using glass jars or your own plastic drinking cups. We'll get to that later) etc. Sprinkle 2-4 seeds 2-4in deep in the soil of your holder and set them by your windowsill or on a shady area of your porch. Water as directed and bring inside whenever there is inclement weather or intense heat. Allow these to grow til their second set of leaves sprout, that is the best rule of thumb to let you know when to transplant them.  

**Planting your seedlings**

* Once you have your seedlings matured, tubs and soil, cut the holder along one side and gently place the seedling (soil and all) into a hole dug just an inch or two deeper than the seedling's soil. Group 1-2 seedlings together at least 3in from the edge of the tub. Why group a couple together? Because not all seedlings are promised to mature. Then repeat this the recommended length apart from one another. A good rule of thumb I've found is about 5in will be perfect for most any plant regardless of the packet's directions. 


**Now you've got your seedlings in their forever home!**

 Okay now I have some baby plants in a bin, what next? 

* Next we will place our tubs of seedlings near a window, if your room is painted any variant of white (Cream, tan, etc.) you can place your plants just slightly out of the sunlight due to light reflecting off of the walls, for example; on your kitchen table, nightstand in bedroom or end table in living room. Feel free to put a surface next to a window to give it the most light possible. 

* Now is the easier part in my opinion. Water your plants as needed. Simply keep your packets handy to reference to amount of water needed for each plant. I keep mine on my fridge with the name of the plant taped to the tub so I don't forget.

* Be patient! Your plants will grow with some good tlc and time. I suggest pruning dead or dry leaves to keep their nutrients in and rotating your plants whenever you notice they are leaning towards the light. 

* Pow! In a few weeks/months you will have produce to eat!


**Protips For Growing**

* Some plants such as tomatoes will need a little helping hand for their vines to grow accordingly, Place a stick per seedling next to their leaves so they have some support to carry their fruit later. 

* If you spot any light specs on your leaves that are not natural to their standard coloring your soil is too acidic, if you can get some wood to burn (even just some small sticks) spread ashes in the soil to correct the Ph balance. 

* Position your sunshine loving plants to the north for all day sunshine.

* Growing indoors is a good way to protect your plants for pests and diseases.

* Don't wan't to pay for seeds? If you're already buying organic produce you can take the seeds out of the produce and plant them. 

* Composting is a whole different post in and of itself but, if you can compost you can have amazingly nutritious soil for basically nothing.

* Try to keep your home around 70 degrees for optimal growth of most plants, anything lower than 60 will slow their growth or possibly kill them. Most homes are around 70 in most months of the year. 

* **Not all plants have to be grown as separate seedlings, you can directly plant some seeds. Usually vegetables can be directly sown from seeds. A quick google search will tell you if you can.**

* You can grow any plant out of season with the right conditions indoors. 

* **My favorite tip, place plants in your bathroom. When you shower the steam will water the plants for you**

* During the winter keep plants away from windowsills 

* **Don't have time to water your plants? Make a self watering pot by poking holes on the neck of a plastic bottle, screw the cap on and the soil will absorb water when needed.** You can also put plant nutrients in the water for extra benefits.

* If you have florescent light bulbs installed in your home they will benefit low to medium range lighting plants. Red wavelength light is best for bringing plants to fruition if you do not have much natural light (Search incandescent light bulbs).  

* **Set aside the seeds from your best veggie/fruit to grow your next plant free**

Hope this helps! If it wasn't for my indoor garden I wouldn't have had anything more than rice and beans to eat at least a week out of the month. 

Edit: Again, I am by no means a professional, but I felt it would be worthwhile to take the time to write this to give people a starting point for growing indoors. There are always better ways to grow produce than how I listed, I grow my own plants on a larger scale than this. This post is meant to be a starting point for someone looking to grow their own food, not a gospel truth.

984,duj2wp,False,None,23,Finally have a savings account in the black for the first time in awhile!,povertyfinance,"So I've been struggling with finances for a long time after having both no financial education given to me when I was younger and a habit of spending myself into stupid holes with crap I don't really need. With no one to guide me and bad habits coming back to bite frequently, I finally had enough. I've been listening to a lot of financial advice videos and podcasts (like Dave Ramsey among others) and have been getting my budget on track for the first time since... 2014, I think? It's been really helpful and I think I'm starting to make progress even if I'm not where I want to be long-term just yet.

Over the last year from August '18 to now, I've accomplished the following:

1. Bought a new (used) laptop that's much better to work with in school (as I am a college student) than my last laptop, and I paid cash for it (about $2,000 with side equipment).
2. Built up an emergency fund on my main bank account to $1,000, as that is Dave's ""Baby Step 1"" before tackling debts elsewhere.
3. Balanced all of my bank accounts so they have (at the time of writing this) at least $300 in savings each, and I'm putting a small amount back into each account every paycheck. I have 4 accounts and for the last several years, typically 2 of them were in overdraft at any given time, so this is a huge improvement. My goal is $1,000 in each account minimum.
4. Beginning to pay down my student loans while I'm still in college, and also beginning to pay down medical debts from six years ago (which I foolishly ignored and let double, so tackling those feels good).
5. Bought a used car for the first time ever instead of having one given to me; saved about two months for that and paid it off in full last month. About $1,200 plus registration fees, and it's very high fuel economy (Geo Metro) and is saving me money against what I used to drive. I pay about $40 per month in gas for it and I'm driving 50 miles a day.
6. Paying all my bills every month including renting an apartment with a friend (instead of living on campus on financial aid or in someone else's house); renter's insurance, car insurance, electric, groceries, etc. and still having enough left over to pay down the older bills I mentioned above.
7. Not spending as much money on frivolous stuff and keeping track of the miscellaneous things I do buy, making an effort to spend less and less each month on things I don't need and put the rest into savings.
8. Currently have enough to pay about 2.5 months' worth of straight bills if I remain conservative with what I spend. Not including separate savings I have which are education-specific (Pell Grant, Scholarships, AmeriCorps service award), I've got about $2,000 to my name outside the car, the laptop, everything I own, and the bills I'm working on. I haven't had anywhere close to $2,000 readily available in over five years and back then I wasn't paying my own bills, was living with family, and only ever reached about $5,500 after working two jobs with seven-day schedules for about 6 months straight, then I mistakenly blew that in about two or three months. So I'm not back to where I was just yet, but I'm still doing better overall and should surpass my goal in 2020 if I stay moving straight.

This feels really good, guys. I know it sounds like I'm bragging and I apologize for that, but I just genuinely feel great about where I'm at for once. I work full-time while in school so I have very little free time, but it's starting to pay off. I don't use credit cards (both out of principle and because the medical debt shot my credit score, so oh well), and I'm only making $17.50/hr, but even that I'm grateful for as it's more I've made in other jobs I've had. I'm feeling like I might actually have hope for the future and be debt-free in a few years. It's a fantastic feeling.

**EDIT:** This became more popular than I was expecting so I should add some additional info for clarification. I'm 25, and this progress has largely come about since I was 24, hence the mention of ""over the last year"". However, everything from the list (items 1-8 stating with the computer) has been from November '18 to now, and August was when I started college after a 6-year gap. This story starts further back in 2012 when my dad passed unexpectedly and not long afterward, I was homeless living in his car. He didn't teach me how to handle money properly; in fact, he was terrible with it and died in debt (which I had to pay off myself at 18) and he ruined a lucrative family business and stole money from his family years before, in essence teaching me what not to do instead of what to do. When he was gone I was on my own, moved in with an uncle who gave me a better example of how to handle money, and in 2014 I started saving up that $5,500 I mentioned with the hope of going back to school that much sooner. It didn't happen, I made a series of dumb decisions, and was homeless a second time. At that point I only had myself to blame, but after some medical crises I moved in with my mom, who is still alive but equally as bad with money as my dad was, and she also stole money from family albeit in a more indirect, morally ambiguous way. So between both of them, I had no guidance and no direction. I spent whatever little money I had from work on extravagances and learned to get by without saving for the future, which is a poor plan in just about every way. In early 2018 my mom was put under investigation for something unrelated and our family structure collapsed. She lost our house (not the first time, and dad had done the same thing years before) and it left me trying to pick up the pieces. For a second time I moved in with my uncle, this time determined to not let his generosity be in vain. After fucking around and accomplishing little over six years since leaving high school, I studied for the ACT and SAT in my hours outside of work, all the while paying for storage for my mom's things while she got her situation figured out. I drove 180 miles to the nearest ACT test facility last summer, got a score good enough to get into college with, and finally went back to school on a shoestring budget, knowing fully well the only way I would afford it was to work full-time throughout. From August '18 through now, that's exactly what I've done, as well as having incorporated a move to a cheaper school in another state to help stay within my budget and pay off bills. So I went from being homeless and dealing with my parents' poor decisions to where I'm at now, and I think that makes it all the better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/duj2wp/finally_have_a_savings_account_in_the_black_for/,738,"Hey, you're working hard and smart.

YNAB recommends stretching things until your money is at least 30 days old, as in you're using last month's paychecks to pay this month's bills. It also means you're not living paycheck to paycheck.

I figure I would start a conversation today regarding some PF essentials. Hopefully this thread will help lay a good foundation to start (or continue) our journey towards financial freedom.  

Things that I learned from this sub and have implemented:

1. Spend less: Pretty obvious but you would be surprised how much spending we do when we are not conscious of spending money. 

2. Make a budget and stick to it: I count calories in order to lose weight on a weekly basis. I applied the same concept to spending money. I can only spend X amount on groceries, X amount at a coffee shop, X amount when I go out, etc. 

3. Get on a plan to pay off debt: Paying credit card debt can take some months, even years, but the more CC debt you pay down (and not add too) the more the debt will decrease. If you stick to a payment plan and are disciplined it is just a matter of time before your cards are paid off. Also, if you have school loan debt seek out forgiveness options. Thanks to this sub I was able to get on a 10-year plan to have my debt forgiven. 

4. Find a low-cost lifestyle: Nights out in the club and checking out the new movie releases every week can crush a budget. Some cheaper options for entertainment I‚Äôve enjoyed include reading at the library (or coffee shop), writing on a blog (free on WordPress), playing fighting games (high cost of entry but once established it is ‚Äúfree‚Äù to play and improve), and not drinking alcohol.

5. Get in shape: I feel it is easier to deal with being poor if you are shredded compared to if you are in bad health. Working out has really helped me with the day to day stress of dealing with denying myself in an effort to save more money. Also, make sure you are getting an adequate amount of sleep. If you suffer from insomnia or struggle to sleep look into remedies (meditation, consistent bed time, exercise, journaling).
