3,7e1jo1,False,Subreddit Discussion,11056,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,science,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  

Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.

Furthermore, it’s unknown how long a person has to be exposed in order to actually get sick to begin with. I’ve seen estimates of 10, 15 or even more minutes of direct, no mask contact being used as the yardstick.

My argument is that in this case, with the hair stylists wearing masks, and the haircuts being mostly under thirty minutes, along with the fact the salon was likely employing hand sanitizer, the patrons could have used no masks and likely seen similar results.

I know there will be opposition to my statement, but there are plenty of studies shooting down masks as an effective measure for stopping the spread of something like Covid.

“We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).

Costs have exponentially increased after individuals stopped paying for their care themselves.  Here is an example.

I had several emergency surgeries and the total bill was $28,000.  I did not have insurance at the time because I’m self-employed and would have to choose between paying for housing or insurance.  The bill was reduced to $7000 because I was a cash patient.  Why is the cost so different? Are hospitals overcharging that much if you have insurance?  

Our education system is a different matter.  Teachers are usually terrific in our nation, but are severely underpaid.  Most teachers in primary schools pay for supplies out of pocket, and give parents lists for requested items.  The money allocated for increases in spending often just goes to the upper ranks of the administration and projects that those in power want.  Teacher’s unions do a great job of protecting teachers from unfair practices, but they do student’s a major disservice and obviously don’t help the wage problems for the people that actually do most of the work.

There may be something in it, but it's doing little more than a very weak validation for people who aren't satisfied with their body. As pointed out, this could help with treating certain dysphorias, but it's so marginal I feel other places could provide more useful data.

What is more interesting is that womens' short term and long term preferences are apparently identical, and mens' perceptions of womens' preferences are also identical on the same axis, which is very surprising to me, and it would be interesting to see how that compares to data from other studies. It makes sense that there is a skew towards slightly more fat and slightly higher BMI women in longer-term relationships, however, as these women are less likely to run into certain childbearing problems, which is not usually a concern with short-term relationships.

What this study also doesn't answer, is the question in regards to cognitive dissonance between polled preferences and the people that men and women actually date. From my hypothesis, there's a mismatch that is far larger than the margins shown here. If this is true, what would be the cause of this dissonance? Is it due to imbalances between expectations and the availability of people that meet criteria, are we dishonest with ourselves about what we want (perhaps to meet some real or assumed norm), or are we possibly overstating the actual importance of body shape?

The types of injuries most commonly sustained by soccer players are musculoskeletal injuries to the lower body.

Injuries in Football

Football was ranked as the third most dangerous sport in 2011 by the Bleacher Report, due to the sheer numbers of football related injuries. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2009, 212,000 children were seen in emergency rooms for football injuries. By 2011, there were 275,050 emergency room visits for football players between ages 12 and 17, with 13 percent involving concussions. Knee injuries are relatively common among football players, with lower-extremity injuries overall accounting for half of all injuries. Thirty percent of other injuries involve the upper body. Strains, sprains, contusions, fractures and concussions are the most common types of injury sustained.

Comparing the Two Sports

Both sports carry a risk of injury, and it is impossible to quantify an individual player's overall risk of injury during a game of a season. In general, both sports take a relatively heavy toll on the knees and lower extremities. The risk of injury to the upper extremities is much higher in football than in soccer -- with the exception of the goalkeeper, soccer players do not use their hands and arms to handle the ball. However, concussion injuries are equally likely in soccer and football players. Football players are more likely to suffer injuries to the cervical spine, which can be catastrophic or life-threatening. ",2017-09-19 14:26:04

Anxiety via hyperawareness could easily be perceived as an auditory processing issue.

ADHD is one giant auditory (among other stimuli) overload. 

Maybe there are a handful of switches here, and in typical people, none of them are pressed...but in neurodiverse people, different combinations of slight changes in auditory processing (say, at different steps along that process) leads to each of those neurodiverse outcomes.

Including, it seems, schizophrenia.

There might be some benefit in looking at the neurodiverse community from this perspective. There might be some way to do something at the brain level (some kind of chemical software patch) that fixes the auditory processing and solves a whole bunch of different conditions. ",2018-02-12 10:15:54

Certain early life factors such as the mother's feeding method (breast feeding vs. Formula feeding), delivery method (natural birth vs. c. section), diet, and early antibiotic use (in pregnant woman or in newborn infants) all may play a role in the establishment of a gut microbiota which confers development of a normally functioning immune system.

All of the factors listed may decrease a newborn's exposure to ancestral microbes which have evolved alongside early hunter-gatherers.
