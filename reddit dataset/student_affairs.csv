ffuvgc,A running list of university closures and actions in response to COVID-19. How is your work changing?,"We're up to two dozen US universities and college campuses that have either suspended classes or relocated a bulk of in-person classes to online/distance learning. Some locations have cancelled classes for a few days or a week; others have done so indefinitely or until the end of the current semester or quarter. I'll keep a running list here if there's any interest.

It appears in most cases, classes are cancelled or altered, but offices are remaining open. Student events are being cancelled, air travel and international travel cancelled or advised against, but staff are still working. Can any SA professionals share how their university's actions are changing their day-to-day job?

As per CDC guidelines [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html) and [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html), most institutions have imposed restrictions and guidelines on international travel that includes canceling or postponing some or all international travel. Many universities are also employing restrictions on university-sponsored domestic air travel. Many institutions are also recommending students, staff, faculty, and others to follow guidelines from the CDC and stay home when sick, wash and sanitize hands properly, self-quarantine following exposure to known infected individuals or onset of respiratory symptoms. For the sake of simplicity, the list below is only inclusive of institution closures and alterations of academic coursework.

ejtyd4,Advice on taking a supervising position overseeing two men who clearly have an issue with my age and gender,"I’m currently in an office of 4 with one vacant position: three advisors (including me) and one manager (the vacant spot is a fourth advisor).

Two of the advisors are older men while I and my supervisor are younger women. Both men struggled with my supervisor in different ways. Both men also clearly do not respect me and my ideas in their own way.

My supervisor had given her two weeks and I have been offered to take her position. This would be my first supervisory role AND I would now be supervising the two men.

One of the men is very unprofessional in every meeting and sends unnecessary unprofessional and passive aggressive emails to our supervisor and copies our whole team. My supervisor had me provide a statement for HR to put in his file. Another department submitted another statement addressing his lack of professionalism. This guy also does the minimum. 

The other man told me from day one to get out. He has been applying to every position he can. He’s been in the same position for 10+ years. He treats me like a child and dismisses my thoughts and ideas. He always complains to me about our current supervisor and does not follow procedures when it effects other students, even after addressed three separate times in different ways. This guy also does the minimum.

I intend to meet with my supervisor and talk to her about my concerns before deciding on the position.

Pros to accepting the position: a slight pay raise and supervisory experience

Cons: adding an hour to my commute there and back again (currently 45-60 mins) which means more gas, seeing the first man everyday since my office would’ve next to his (currently my office is not on main campus), not work directly with students as often (which I know comes with moving up in student affairs).

Any thoughts on taking or not taking?
Anyone who’s dealt with experienced such as this?
Any webinars or books to look into for new supervisors or dealing with people such as this?

I’m looking for any and all opinions/advice/stories I can get as I have to make my decision at the beginning of the next week. 


NOTE: I was told the two guys will NOT be offered the position because they don’t trust them in the position and don’t think it fits. They said they MIGHT offer it to someone else on campus if I say no, otherwise they have to open for applications.


UPDATE 1.6.20: I got a call this morning saying they’ve changed the position slightly. They’re removing the supervisory aspect and would only give me 2k more a year for the position (which would probably just cover the additional gas for the heat). The two incentives to take the position have been removed so I will NOT be taking the offer and will be focusing on helping my students and finding another job (still).

gsezpc,Is anyone else feeling burned out as a result of working from home?,"Since March, our institution has been functioning remotely. I advise students and while they have never been a problem, doing this remotely allows the parents to be within earshot. Every week I deal with a new angry parent who is frustrated for xyz reasons (depts are not answering their phones, the wait times are ridiculous, certain processes not being fulfilled in their usual time frame, etc). The parents (usually the mothers) take it out on me because I’m the person who has a scheduled appointment with their son/daughter.  By the time they get to me, they are upset and trashing the entire institution and I just have to sit there and let them vent. I’m supposed to be dealing with the students directly but these parents (who are seemingly also at home) always monopolize the conversation. I’m getting so frustrated and tired.

fxghms,Thoughts on getting a Ph.D.?,"I'll be graduating in less than a month with my Master's Degree but really want to continue to pursue my education and have found some programs that really interest me. I'd be interested in applying this year to join the cohort for 2021.

I'm not saying it's not worth it, hell I have one, but I would be sure you want and need it to advance in your career path before going down that road. 

Also, as others have said, if you are ""traditionally"" aged, I'd recommend getting some experience first to make sure you really want to do what you think you want to do.

fnz3mw,Hall Director with questions of layoffs,"Hello all.

I hope I'm not adding to the fear and anxiety already present everywhere. I just want to be prepared for whatever happens next.

As the title states I am a Hall Director. I recently (as in the last 6 months) started my job but now with residents leaving and things like summer courses going online  and summer conferences canceling I am wondering if there would be layoffs. I have never been fired or experience a layoff so I don't know what to expect. I am hoping a four-year university is able to keep me but I dont know what I'm looking at.

Is it likely that they will layoff the newest person first? Would I get enough warning? I do not have the ability to move back home without being a big burden on my family, went bankrupt, and spent 4 months of near  homelessness before finding this job. I barely started saving up money again so I d ok nt have that cushion yet. I know I can get through this but I don't know how this works and how it would work in a university.

Any help or pointers would be appreciated.",studentaffairs,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/fnz3mw/hall_director_with_questions_of_layoffs/,False,,3,"This is a U.S. based answer.

It's all opinion and little fact, but gives you a few things to consider.

A layoff likely would target non-essential employees who are unable to serve students at a distance. Residence Hall employees fall in this category at most institutions.  Depending on size, it's unlikely a single individual will be laid off--when necessary, it's going to be a larger group.  If laid off, you likely would qualify for unemployment and that's going to provide some fiscal security.  An HR staff would provide assistance if that happens.  

A public institution may be better positioned to rebound and return to normal operations.  Residence halls are among the first to get called back.

**Options to weather the storm?**

Does your university have a hospital that needs assistance in IT, patient intake, nursing assistance? Can you propose you and your staff provide online support for the college IT department, can you provide assistance for faculty developing online classes? Any colleagues willing to assist with a place to stay?  An older faculty member may provide housing in exchange for shopping assistance--send a note to college deans under the premise of looking out for your staff. You could be the hero a lot of worried RA's and at-risk seniors need.  Plan how you would reach vulnerable seniors to offer services.  Start planning now (not worrying, but planning).  

Youth, health, and your status as a university employee in a trusted position make you a highly desirable asset. ",2020-03-24 12:43:40

---------

If you enjoy learning for the sake of improving yourself and you believe in the transformational power of education, student affairs courses are going to seduce you. 

**Why you should earn your M.Ed:**  An M.Ed will be easier to obtain because you'll be living the curriculum, bringing experiences into the classroom, and daily applying what you've learned.  A lot of universities intentionally make this degree convenient and affordable for employees because everyone benefits.  Having a group of academic/professional peers (classmates) helps employees navigate job stress, learn the jargon, collaborate better, and expand professional connections.  You're also less likely to quit until you finish the degree.


**Why you should consider a different major:** You already have the student affairs job.  Work-sponsored professional development will help you improve your advising skills and advance, as long as you complete a master's degree that is vaguely applicable (business, law, counseling, etc.). The M.Ed is too common among higher education professionals to differentiate you in a crowded applicant pool. As long as you have a good reputation, complete a semi-relevant masters degree, and continue getting work experience, you'll be okay.  

Should you decide to leave academia in 10 years, you're going to appreciate having a degree with more marketability.



TLDR: Do or do not, but consider the journey. ",2020-01-21 23:36:52
ecn84v,Moving from Teaching to Student Affairs/ Academic Advising???,"Hi everyone! New to this sub & I really liked the advice y'all were giving, so I thought I would seek some of my own! 

I currently teach high school history and have since I graduated undergrad in 2017. Right now I'm 5 classes away from being finished with a masters in middle grades education, which I began when I thought I still wanted to teach. After doing some soul searching (and continuously being yelled at by teenagers) I decided that the classroom is not where I want to spend all my time. I'd really like to move into an academic advising position or something similar. I want to stay in education, but not as a teacher.

How easy/ possible do you think this would be? A lot of the skills that are posted on job listings match what I do as a teacher, except I do them with students before they hit university age. I've applied to a few places but either haven't heard back or have been rejected. Any helpful hints? Thank you!!",studentaffairs,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/ecn84v/moving_from_teaching_to_student_affairs_academic/,False,,17,"I started out as a secondary math teacher, then got my masters in Higher education, and am am an academic advisor at a large public university. My background isn't exactly like yours, but I have served on hiring committees for academic advisors and I very much remember my past experiences in teaching, so hopefully this comment is helpful! I can't speak for other universities but I can at least tell you what I would look for in a candidate.

In my office, we don't require candidates to have previously studied our STEM department or majored in it. (ETA I accidentally hit post too early here, adding more!) We do inquire about how you would approach learning the courses and curriculum. This also gives me insight in what your learning style is, and how self aware you are of your learning style. You'd be surprised how many candidates can't describe their learning style! As a teacher, I think you have an advantage here since you have to design lessons that fit multiple learning styles in your classroom. Also, in my STEM department, prerequisites are strictly regulated. I think during my own interview, I impressed my interviewers because I talked at length about the importance of mastering learning objectives in order to move on to the next objective (I was a math teacher, you see). I think this illustrated to my interviewers my understanding of course sequencing and their importance. 

I also tend to ask interview questions about the candidate's previous experiences with students. I want to know how you handle students who don't follow your advice or direction (I'm sure as a teacher you have plenty of these experiences, I sure did haha). As an academic advisor, I am constantly questioned and challenged when I don't give the answer a student wants. What about times when you worked with a difficult student and were successful with them? I want to know about that too! As a teacher, you have hundreds of student interactions to draw from, so even if they're not college students, the way you interact with them can still tell me a lot about your potential advising style and professionalism. 

So my suggestion would be to reflect on SPECIFIC experiences with specific students and practice telling them as a story (of an appropriate interview length, of course). The biggest pitfall I see during interviews are when candidates are very general with their answers. For example, I may ask a candidate ""tell me about a time when a student challenged you or did not follow your advice"" and the candidate will answer ""well, when students challenge me, I do X, Y, Z"". That's a very brief and general answer which doesn't really tell me anything. Candidates who give very general answers like this are frequently scored lower because we can't actually picture how they would be as an advisor in our office. 

I would have rather that candidate told me a SPECIFIC situation with an individual student with details. Walk me through the situation, what you told the student to do, why they challenged you or refused to do it, and then what happened in the end. How did you behave in the moment when the student challenged you? Were there more details that ended coming out that explained why the student challenged you? Did you end up being right (and it's ok if you weren't!) This tells me much more about your thinking process, your professionalism, and how you respond to conflict in the moment. Since you don't have direct experience with college students, it would be very important for me to hear specific stories from you. 

Again, this is all based on my experiences and my university. Of course, other advising offices may approach interviewing differently. Hope this helps, and good luck! ",2019-12-19 11:11:45
d9ari0,Leaving Student Affairs... advice?,"I'm a fairly young professional. I have about five years of experience in student affairs and higher ed admin, and I want to leave. I have my undergrad degree in psychology and a minor in communications. I have a M.Ed in Higher Ed Administration. 

I try to stay positive here, but my time in higher education has been pretty miserable. I never secured roles in the departments I wanted, I've gone to a number of professional development events and conferences, I utilized my University's career development program, and it gets me nowhere. I've asked colleagues for advice and it usually isn't helpful. Either they contradict each other or they give empty advice like "" this role is only temporary"" or ""it will happen."" Meanwhile, I'm stuck at a job where 75% of my work shouldn't even require a Bachelor's degree. I'm worn out from the constant e-mail and phone interruptions. So, I've decided I'm done. It's not that I've given up hope in finding a better job in higher ed, it's that I no longer find it appealing.

In this process, I've come to realize that the things that appealed to me in higher education are present in other fields. Things like training and development, project assessment, and out of classroom learning. I have also found that the interactions I do have with students are far less meaningful than expected and I work well independently or with less interaction with people. I'd love to find a role in either digital marketing or a training-related role. I'm hopeful these role will appeal to me more and give me more job satisfaction.

For anyone in student affairs, do you have advice for making this type of transition? Or do you have a colleague who made a similar transition? I'd love to know what they found successful and helped things move along. I keep applying for jobs and putting myself out there and I get nothing. It's hard to reach the realization that my master's degree didn't lead to career development and it seems my past couple of roles have given me few marketable skills.

7beesa,"Interested in student affairs, but worried about my introverted nature and (mild) social anxiety.","Hi everyone,

I'm not sure how active this sub is still, but I am interested in pursuing a master's degree in student affairs/higher ed administration. Currently I work in a university as a publicist and webmaster for a department. I've realized I really like the higher ed environment but I'm not exactly sure where I ultimately want to fit in, so my mind is on the master's program in higher ed my university offers.

Anyway, I really like the idea of academic advising, but I'm worried about not being personable or relate-able enough, if that makes sense. I'm an INTJ and I take a daily medication for anxiety/depression, but I have been happy and stable for years. I'm totally fine interacting with people and I consider myself easygoing and friendly, but part of me feels like an academic advisor needs to be a sort of counselor that can relate to students, empathize with them, etc., whereas I tend to be more...reserved and analytical?

This is sort of a ramble, but what are your thoughts on working in student affairs as an introvert with mild anxiety (but not debilitating).",studentaffairs,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/7beesa/interested_in_student_affairs_but_worried_about/,False,,28,"I am an introvert as well, and have been an advisor for 4.5 years.  But I also consider myself an ""ambivert.""  Can be extroverted when needed, lol.  

And I'm ""lead advisor"" now (sounds cool, doesn't mean much) and have 5 other advisors on my team.  There's a mix of introverts and extroverts.  In my opinion that's crucial to have that dichotomy.   Many students you interact with are introverts, and being able to relate will make sessions that much better.

My anxiety went away after the first 6-8 months.  Once I got most of the material memorized, I started to grow as an advisor and have more confidence.  Being analytical is pretty god dang important in Academic Advising.  Being able to predict problems and come up with solutions is one of my favorite parts of the job.  

My ""advice.""  Embrace it you introversion!  There will be plenty of directors willing to hire an introverted, yet friendly and easy going person, who truly cares about students.  

Hope this helps!  Good luck!! ",2017-11-08 00:46:34

fx0geq,How to Organize Coursework in a SA Degree,"Hi folks! I just recently enrolled in my first semester of graduate school courses and I’m ecstatic. These don’t start until August obviously, but I wanted to get a head start as to how to organize myself for graduate level coursework.

To be honest, it took me a few years in undergrad to get a system down that worked for me. I realized (a little bit later than I would have hoped) that writing everything down is the best way for me to go about studying.

How do y’all take notes for these courses in lecture and for readings? What suggestions do you have organization wise that will help me do my best? What was the biggest difference from undergrad to grad school?

Something I started doing towards the end of undergrad that I adopted again in grad school (I had a 3 year gap between the two) was writing down every assignment/project I had due for every class, organizing them by date, and then listing them out on a word document. I even included readings that I needed to do on there (because reading in grad school is hella important!). I would then color code assignments by class (I always took 3 classes per semester). I would separate assignments out by month and then date. Next to every assignment I would write out the number of points it was worth (if it was graded) and then a box so I could check it off when I was done. I would also go back after I got a grade and include the grade in there, as well, to keep track of my progress.

It's kind of hard to explain, so if you'd like to PM me I can send you an example of what I had! I swear staying organized and having that system was a huge contributer to my success. I made a 4.0 for what it's worth :) ",2020-04-08 13:25:01

e8vzup,Breaking into an Academic Advising Career,"Hi all, 

A little background about me.  I have a B.S. degree in Biological and Conservation and Environmental Sciences.  The past three years after college I have either spent unemployed, working for academic research centers, or working for municipalities doing environmental work.  After doing some reflecting, Im realizing that the science fields are too strict and impersonal for my taste.  I am considering doing a teaching residency, but I am not sure how I feel about working with children.  I would love to stay in Academia though, so Ive also been considering Academic Advising.  

I was hoping to get some insight on Academic Advising.  What are the main functions of the position? Does it require a Masters Degree, and if so, why?  I have read that people have a better chance of working their way into an Academic Advising role by starting off as an admin assistant at a college and just getting to know people.  Ive also read that Academic Advising is flooded with people with PhDs that didnt make it in their respective field and effectively block anyone else from entering the field.  

Through my past jobs I got some exposure to interacting with clients (supervisor event production job in college) and some PR work (showing investors, future students, and visiting professors around our research facility), so I feel that I could effectively communicate with students about colleges and the paths they can take, especially if its in the sciences.",studentaffairs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/e8vzup/breaking_into_an_academic_advising_career/,False,,8,"At my university, a lot of the advisors in our College of Arts & Sciences have degrees in the major they advise for. That allows our Bio advisors to relate much more to the students than other individuals could. I advise for education majors, which includes biology education. I haven't taken a biology course since high school and course descriptions can only tell me so much about a course. I can still relay degree requirements, but I am at a disadvantage because I have no experience in the coursework. Our advisors aren't required to have a degree in the field they advise for, but it allows for a deeper connection to the students and the program if they do. Aside from typical advising responsibilities, I also work with our college's living learning communities. It includes more night and weekend events, but allows me to build relationships with our students in different settings. The recruiting component of my position offers PR opportunities. I connect with prospective students, supervise visits to campus, and market the more personal view of our college and university as a whole. ",2019-12-11 04:15:06
bliie1,I created a survey but got zero credit/recognition...,"I’m in a position where there’s practically zero opportunities to grow in my office. I graduated last year and so I’m the freshest face in our office of 5. When I was hired I was told because I have an outside perspective that want me to help improve the program, review and provide improvements for policies and procedures.

One huge recommendation was an annual or bi-annual survey. So they had me take the lead on it. So I created two surveys and told them we can edit whatever, add/delete, change anything. I also asked for feedback. This was also 2 months ago. I followed up with my boss about two weeks later and they said they’ll review it and get back to me.

5 minutes ago I received an email from my boss to the 4 of us. She had sent out my survey, made it live, collecting data, and didn’t say a word to me, not even as a “thanks, this is awesome, we’re gonna go ahead and make it live and send it out.”

I feel bad for feeling upset, but at the same time I spent a lot of time putting it together a long survey and didn’t receive ANY communication that it was going live nor feedback on it.",studentaffairs,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/bliie1/i_created_a_survey_but_got_zero_creditrecognition/,False,,9,"I’ve been in your shoes as the person creating the survey and doing the behind the scenes work without always getting credit and now I direct a student affairs office (and still do tons of stuff without getting credit).

Yes, it would have been nice for your supervisor to thank you - at least in an email.  And think back a bit, did they ever thank you when you initially sent it or even in person?  As a director I get so many emails and always try to respond in person or in email even with a “thanks - I’ll review this and get back to you by next week”.  I’m sorry if they did not say thank you to you, I get that can be a bummer.

But that doesn’t mean your work isn’t valued.  Again, I don’t always get a thank you from my boss but I know if he sends my work product on with minimal edits it means he thinks I did a good job.  I do that with my staff too.  If I sent a survey out to a group, I normally send it on behalf of our team and rarely do I ever send out a survey and specify who created it.  That doesn’t mean I don’t value my staff.

I also understand what it feels like to be in a role where you aren’t valued or appreciated and if that’s the case, move on to a new role/position if you are able.  But I’d also caution that just because you weren’t explicitly thanked for one work product doesn’t mean you aren’t valued and is possibly an unrealistic expectation.  Keep up the good work!

This summer CronkNews.com, higher education’s satirical news blog, celebrates its fifth birthday.

I’ve been in the higher ed game for over 20 years, worked at public, private, co-ed, single-sex, religious, independent, altruistic and soulless colleges. The same characters appear on every campus, which gave me hope that other educators would relate The Cronk’s satire. I had no idea!

In addition to editing, I’ve begun a traveling show called “There’s Something Funny about Higher Education,” in which small teams of educators use elements of humor as a springboard for innovation.

&#x200B;

Still, she had the right skill set, possessed significant drive, and seemed like she could be a great fit for a role that requires A LOT of project management competencies. She ended up being 1 of 2 finalists. 

&#x200B;

Problem #2: in her final interview with my Vice Provost, she failed to give a straight answer around her plans for her private contracting company; my VP ultimately deduced that the candidate not only had no intentions of operating a proper divide between the role and their private business, but may actually have had aspirations of using the role to promote themselves and cultivate new business opportunities on the side. 

&#x200B;

We didn't hire her. She continued to promote our office's work on LinkedIn, and --completely appropriately-- be a vocal fan of the work our team does. 

&#x200B;

Problem #3: she ended up inviting herself to one of the big networking events the role manages. This is fairly normal, while it's an alumni-student networking event it is not abnormal for parents or ""friends of the university"" to join. However, she took the opportunity introduce herself to the person who actually got the job by essentially saying, ""Hi Jamie, my name is Gloria and I was the other finalist for your job. Do a great job tonight"". Mind you, the person we hired had only been in the role for 2 months at this point, and this was their first big event; they were already nervous and this person's presence and demeanor only contributed to that anxiety. 

&#x200B;

Problem #4: about 40 alumni come to this event and we have each of them introduce themselves by **quickly** stating their name, current industry, and graduation year + major. When we invited all the alumni to the front of the room this person decided to come up too, she shouldn't have. She placed herself at the front of the line and instead of quickly introducing herself, went on a 2 or 3 minute introduction that set a precedent that slowed down the whole process by maybe 15 minutes.

&#x200B;

Problem #5: a few months later she asked to get coffee with me because she was hoping for ""some mentorship"". I was happy to connect and help how I could. She didn't want mentorship, she wanted me to buy the product of the new company she was working for. 

&#x200B;

Tenacity is important. Networking is vital. But *for the love of god* partner these things with tact and self-awareness.  ",2019-03-05 06:53:09
9qek8y,Can I get a breakdown of NACA/ACUHO-I/NODA summer internships?,"Howdy all, 

I'm a first year grad in a student affairs administration program, currently GAing in housing. I don't really know what my goals are long-term job wise upon graduation, but hoping to get a better breadth of experience the next few semesters.

I'm a little confused on what all the summer internship programs are (one is required for my program). Obviously, I'm somewhat familiar with ACUHO-I, but NACA and NODA are two programs I've been recommended, but have no idea what they really are. Could anyone give me rough breakdown of what they are, are they paid, time commitments, etc.? I think that'd be really helpful!",studentaffairs,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/9qek8y/can_i_get_a_breakdown_of_nacaacuhoinoda_summer/,False,,3,"Hey! I completed a NODA Internship this last summer in between undergrad/grad and it was honestly one of the most influential experiences of my student affairs career thus far. 

My position was located in the southeast US. I worked a full time schedule at 40hrs/wk and was paid a stipend, 10 meals/week meal plan to the on-campus dining hall, a compensated suite-style single (I was the only person in the whole suite, though.) My supervisor had also used a P-card to get groceries for myself and the other NODA intern prior to our first paychecks. Pay wasn't great (is it ever in student affairs?), but the total experience itself was phenomenal. My institution was a <5000 enrollment so we only had four first-year orientations and three transfer sessions. I wasn't taking it for credit but my supervisor had worked with the other grad (she was enrolled in an internship course) regarding all assignments. 

We were also given ample opportunities to meet and potentially work with other departments for informational meetings or light amounts of side work (ex. I worked with the student-athlete services on the campus to make a life skills presentation.)

10/10 would do again and if you want to know more I'm certainly happy to talk more, I can pm more specifics. I did talk a lot about my actual experience but I can let you know more about the application process, too!

g98dfj,Death by a thousand cuts by supervisor. Finally stood up for myself.,"My boss left in February and I was asked to take her position. I would’ve gotten a raise, had a longer commute, and supervised two older men who clearly had a problem with me (one more thank the other). When I was going to say yes to the position, I got a call saying the position changed so that I wouldn’t supervise, the raise was being taken away, and I would still need to go farther for a commute. I was also told that if I didn’t accept the position, they would NOT offer it to my coworkers but they have one person in mind at the institution they’ll offer it to and then look outward.
I decided to say no because I didn’t want to add an hour on my commute for no raise. They offered it to the internal person who trained for a day then decided it was overwhelming and rejected the offer.

They then hired a totally new position: a non academic Dean. The dean talked to me about the office and I told her that I denied the position because xyz. Then they ended up offering to the person they said they wouldn’t offer it to: my colleague who has more of a problem with me because of my age and/or gender. Ever since he got that position he puts my ideas or actions down unnecessarily. Usually he doesn’t copy the dean unless he thinks he’s clearly in the right, and then he copies literally everyone and their moms unnecessarily.
In the transition he very poorly passed most of his students to me to advise, to which he didn’t provide any information other than names and majors to which both or one were incorrect. Keep in mind we’re already two weeks into registration. Come to find out he incorrectly advised many students, but his response when we ask for more information is “well they’re your students now, figure it out and build a rapport.” Which is causing more harm than good right now.

It’s one email or conference call after another that he “gives me a paper cut.” One isn’t a big deal, but they get annoying and kill my mental healthy after a while. My colleague is getting similar but not as often passive aggressive and emails that put him down as well. Our boss would always come back super defensive. I’ve tried being nice, being formal, being informal, being detailed, being vague. Literally every approach comes back with a slap in the face. But nothing extreme enough to bring to HR. 

So finally Friday, I decided to stand up for myself. My boss sent me an email and copied my colleague and one Of my new advisers that my boss transitioned to me last minute. He says to the student, please write up the problem you told me about (instead of my boss helping and providing the problem) and introduced me as the advisor. The says that my colleague is the expert, so he can help too.

Both my colleague and I work with military affiliated students. We are both “experts.” Now my boss has painted this picture that the student should go to my colleague not me, their advisor. My boss has also said to me “you’re not an expert” and has created the precedence that I can’t handle my students. If I need help, I always reach out. He has shown me that he doesn’t believe in my knowledge. And now I can see the student now knowing who to go to because he has been told that his advisor doesn’t have the knowledge to help, when I might. If I ever don’t, I always tell the student I’ll find out.

Now I’m anxious to hear the passive aggressive response. I’m interested to see how he spins this pin me. My previous boss to me to be careful (after she left). I’m just tired of the constant push back when I provide information or ideas. I’ve been looking for a new job for months (he was an awful coworker and I was always wary around him), but I literally can’t do anything else right now.

They’ll never fire him without significant cause. My coworkers feels similar to me, but he is just existing. I think I have more respect for myself and I know I don’t deserve this treatment. I have no idea if it’s because I’m a woman or if it’s because I’m half his age or because of my knowledge. No clue.

Any advice moving forward? Has anyone gone to HR for a similar situation where it wasn’t one significant thing but a thousand small things? I would quit,  but I need to pay my student loans first.",studentaffairs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/g98dfj/death_by_a_thousand_cuts_by_supervisor_finally/,False,,3,"I wouldn’t go as far as secretly recording coworkers. Even if the state law says it’s OK, the institution may have a policy against it and it could backfire on you. 

Go to your supervisor directly and request a one on one meeting to discuss the issue. If it’s not resolved, go to HR. It might not be harassment, but it might fall under micro aggressions.  They might also look into the weird promotion/hiring situation and you could request their reasoning on why they rescinded their initial offer for said position. The hiring committee would have to document that and HR has to keep it on file in case a candidate challenges the decision to not be hired. 

Document your conversations including dates, parties involved, and topics discussed and resolutions if any. If you have emails, hang on to those. Since they were sent using your university’s email domain, they’re fair game. 

As bad as the situation is, now is not a good time to jump ship unless you have a definite secure position lined up elsewhere either at your current institution or elsewhere given how COVID-19 is forcing IHEs to cut ancillary services that are not essential to the university mission. 

Heck, I’m having similar issues at my current position, but I know it would be stupid for me to even mention I’m thinking about quitting even if my position is deemed “safe.” ",2020-04-28 04:11:28

bhtxda,Do I want my master's degree? I have concerns about timing and being overqualified or unemployed.,"I'm looking for some insight.

&#x200B;

I interviewed for a spot in several graduate programs and was not initially matched with an assistantship. I took this as a sign that it's not the right time, and I should pursue other opportunities.  My area of interest is advising, and I haven't found any bachelor-level jobs in my area, but there are still functional areas where I'd be content building experience that don't require a master's degree. Plus working full-time allows me to pay down my student loans.

&#x200B;

But... this week I was contacted by folks with open assistantships in my program of interest (and one of the positions is in advising). I know that if I get an offer, I will have to make a decision very quickly, and I want to have my answer prepared in the event that they do make an offer. 

&#x200B;

I've made my list of pros and cons, and it really comes down to the fact that I am hesitant about getting the degree and being either unemployed or overqualified. I follow the SA Pros group on Facebook and have been a little intimidated by the number of people who are unemployed or who have left the field. Like I mentioned before, I also have some other areas of interest that don't necessarily require a master's degree (e.g. admissions), and I wonder if I should maybe pursue a job in one of those fields before committing to the master's degree. I know that I will need to get the master's degree at some point to get the jobs I'm most interested in, but I don't know if I want to do it now or later.

aq79y1,Students over utilizing services?,"tl;dr: How do I politely suggest that a student limit the number of appointments they schedule with me when they are coming in too frequently?

&#x200B;

I work as an academic advisor, and I'm not sure how to handle this situation. I want to preface this by saying that I 100% want my students to feel comfortable seeking me out as a resource whenever they need to, but I have a few students who I think are maybe scheduling *too many* advising appointments. My institution doesn't have required advising, but we recommend that students come in once per semester to make sure they are on track. I also advise an upper level program, so we also need to make sure they are meeting the admissions requirements for our program. I have one student in particular who has scheduled with me now 6 times this academic year (about once a month). Each time we aren't necessarily discussing anything new (I would say maybe 2-3 of the meetings were absolutely necessary), and some of the questions could have easily been answered via email. 

&#x200B;

Again, I want students to feel comfortable coming in, but when students do this they clog up the appointment system for other students who haven't been able to meet with me yet this semester (or this year). With this last meeting, I think I was able to gracefully suggest that he email his questions and not feel obligated to come back out for another appointment (our location is also not super convenient for students to get to). However, based on the current pattern of behavior I have a feeling he's going to schedule another appointment before the end of the semester. Has anyone ever had to delicately tell a student that they're over utilizing services?",studentaffairs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/aq79y1/students_over_utilizing_services/,False,,5,"A) it's not the case at all colleges but at ours advising appointments are screened by a student employee or admin person first.

Common concepts of liberals and non-liberals mean Democrats and Republicans, respectively, and in general Republicans have tended to be more 'anti-college' and to not value education as much as other things. This would lead me to think that conservative people would face more cognitive dissonance on average by way of their career aside from those at religiously-affiliated institutions.

The political makeup of our environment isn't meant to be 50-50 in that sense, so that would be a significant assumption permeating the study and worldview of the research question. ",2017-10-25 11:25:32

gdssfe,Military spouse leaving the field for two years and then want to get back,"I graduated with my masters in May 2018. We moved to Hawaii and I started a job as an academic advisor immediately. With the new supervisor my mental and emotional health has gone down the drain.
I’ve addressed my concerns with my supervisor who took no responsibility and no ownership of his inability to see me as an equal to my colleague because of my age. In Hawaii, age discrimination laws only apply to 40 and up. Not less than 30.

There is a potential opportunity to work a government job at a military base as an admin (similar pay). It has NOTHING to do with student affairs, but I need to get out, and the university system is union based. You can’t get in unless it’s at the lowest position and you work your way up. I’m well overqualified and I’m only going to be here a couple more years (no time to jump around within an institution).

Long story short: how bad would it look/would you hire someone who hasn’t been at one location for more than 2 years?

1) moved from one to another for double the pay within the university
2) went to grad school
3) this is my job after grad school
4) mentally and emotionally unhealthy because of where I’m at now

I have had to move twice (for my husband’s job) during my first 5 years of student affairs employment and therefore have had 3 positions in 5 years (currently in what I would say is my dream student affairs position). In my experience, it is all about the story that you tell. When you are able to return to student affairs and start applying for positions, I would frame it that you wanted to diversify your experience by taking a position outside of student affairs and think of ways this new work experience could help you to better work with and advise students. My second job was at a community college (something I wouldn’t have considered taking if not for the abrupt move and need for me to get a job quickly) and the experiences I gained there are actually probably the main reason I have my current job. All three moves have been lateral so that’s something else I would expect that you leaving now would mean you would need to take another entry-level position when you return to the field. 

Main advice: even though your current work environment has been toxic, I would not mention that in any future student affairs interviews. Always be positive about past employers even if it was a bad experience. I’ve been on a lot of search committees and candidates who say negative things about past employers never get hired.

My heart isn’t in this profession and I’ve wanted to get into student affairs/higher ed admit for a long time.

I have about 4yr experience working part-time at a registrar office during college and extensively helped students with enrollment questions and issues, and at one point was part of the scheduling and curriculum department as a sort of front desk/admin asst.

emgwrq,Current Ph.D student. Considering stopping this and transitioning into something like an academic advising role.,"Hi /r/studentaffairs!

The title gives you a general idea of the situation I am wondering about but I would love to hear any advice or thoughts you all might have as to whether or not the situation I am considering sounds feasible.

&nbsp;

Some background, I am currently in the second year of my communication and journalism Ph.d program and I have, over the past few months, come to realize that I don't think this is for me. I realized that, when I started my master's program in 2016, I was excited to teach because I wanted to play a meaningful role in the lives of students as they work to make their education *theirs*. However, over the past three and a half years of teaching I didn't quite feel like I got to play the role I wanted to as an instructor. That is to say, I enjoyed teaching and interacting with students, but I didn't feel like I had the opportunity to help students think deeply and critically about why the are working towards a degree and how they can feel a sense of ownership over both their own education as well as the reason they decided to attend college in the first place.

Having gone to community college and worked my way all the way to a paid for Ph.d program, I realized that a lot of the reason I decided to come to this program was because I wasn't sure what to do next or what role I wanted to play as a professional. All of that said I came to the realization that my own experiences as a sort of high-achieving but listless student, combined with the joy I take in helping others understand how they can bring together their strengths and their goals, are why I was excited to teach in grad school. But I only ever thought about it through a teaching lens until recently.

&nbsp;

Anyhow, the main question I want to ask is whether or not trying to transition into academic advising currently seems feasible given my experiences over the course of my graduate program. I'll provide a quick sketch of the things I think (not being super informed yet) make me a potentially decent fit:

- I have 3 years of small class, college-level teaching experience ranging from introductory classes of mostly first year students to upper level classes of juniors and seniors

- I have 2 years of experience working in the communication center at my master's institution as a communication consultant. I worked both 1:1 with students as well as with groups of students on everything from developing speeches to practicing putting thoughts in order and evaluating their own public speaking experiences. I also worked with instructors to design classes around projects focused on critical thinking, debate, and presentation skills that they could bring into their intended careers.

- As a part of the Ph.d program I am attending I became an adviser for the students in our major helping them navigate both the requirements for the majors and minors in our department (3 majors and 2 minors all told) as well as their general education requirements. By the time I finish next semester I will have 1 year of advising experience at a 4 year institution under my belt.

- I have an undergraduate degree, as well as a master's degree, in communication studies with a focus in advocacy. While I know this may not be a direct correlation to advising/student affairs I feel that I could still fit?

- While this may seem simple I am fairly tech savy. I was at one point A+ certified and, while it has lapsed (I didn't pursue a career where it would be central) I have maintained a consistent connection with technology my whole life (also having had to use it regularly in an educational context).

&nbsp;

Those are the big reasons I'm wondering if I could feasibly make the transition to advising or student affairs. Like I said, I am really looking for advice as to whether the skillset I have cultivated over the past few years would be applicable in advising/student affairs. I really don't mind starting off at a lower level/entry position either. Having been a student most of my life though, it is hard to picture not continuing along the academic track to teaching. That's why I'm seeking advice from folks with a different perspective.

ekx6rk,"Residence Life job searching with a pet, need advice","A little bit of back story, I'm a 2nd year housing grad looking to stay in residence life in a live-on position ideally as a hall director. My current institution allows grads and live in staff to have a pet without needing ESA documentation or anything besides up to date vet records. However, I do not want to stay here and would rather end up in one of my target cities (west Washington, Denver, NYC, some others).

Also, I'm unsure of what legal aspects are involved if I decide to go the route of getting him certified as an ESA, if that opens any more doors for me or not.

Lastly, I would appreciate any advice you all have of when to communicate this concern to potential employers... During interviews, before interviews, not until the acceptance phase?

Thanks for help in advance, I can provide additional info if you need or anything wasn't clear.",studentaffairs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/ekx6rk/residence_life_job_searching_with_a_pet_need/,False,,17,"Are you a hall director now?

Your best chances would be to keep quiet about your dog until you get an offer, and then bring it up at that point. If the department allows pets, great! If not, you lose nothing by turning down the offer. But if it's negotiable, your best leverage is when you have an offer. Some institutions do it case-by-case, often having a policy against getting a pet, but that allows for flexibility for those who have pets going in. If they interview you and like you enough to give you the offer, those institutions that have flexibility are most likely to negotiate at that stage (versus, if they know you have a pet at the interview, they might give the initial offer to someone else to avoid the complication).

The downside to this is that you risk putting in the effort, traveling for interviews, etc etc, only to get a, ""Sorry, we have a firm no-pet policy for our live-in staff"". You can avoid this sometimes by googling about their policies prior to the interview, but not everywhere posts their policies online. You can ask, but again, it might cost you the offer. I would suggest putting the effort in up front and risking having to turn down an offer. Better than no offer at all.

I wouldn't recommend going the ESA route. ESAs and their owners are often not protected or privileged under housing or employment laws, and in my (albeit limited) experience, universities that accommodate ESAs for live-in staff when not required to will also accommodate non-ESA pets. Trying to get an animal certified as an ESA for the sole purpose of forcing a landlord or employer to accommodate your pet will probably not make you look better for employment, and is also unethical and often makes things more difficult for individuals with true service animals who seek accommodation.

I work in the campus interfaith office, so I have close contact with students of faith.

I know one queer student of faith who attends another university in the area, so I reached out to them and asked if I could interview them. They said yes! Great, now I need two more. But I'm at a loss.

TODAY, I was sitting in the office and two students comes in. They said that they want guidance to start an interfaith student org...that focuses on LGBT students because they know several LGBT students of faith and want a space for them.

Needless to say, I definitely found my other interviews. Also, I hope this serves as a helpful reminder that students make space for what they want to see, so don't be worried about creating the perfect space :)",studentaffairs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/asieoq/its_like_my_students_know_when_i_need_help/,False,,2,"That is awesome what you did.

742wd3,SA masters program and OPE questions,"Hi Student Affairs! Long-time lurker here.
I'm currently looking at applying for a SA program starting next fall in either counseling with an emphasis in student affairs or higher ed administration. Essentially, just something that will help me get a GAship position, work as a Hall Director after, and eventually transition to recruiting or admissions after that wears of me for a while.

I had questions regarding OPE/TPE/SPE etc.:
First off, everyone I talked to (other RAs, HDs, Res Life admin) told me about OPE, but never mentioned any of the other ones, even though looking at online articles and sources, it seems like TPE has a bigger presence or turnout. Not sure if this is the case, but I was planning on attending OPE this spring as well as apply to some other schools that might not be there, should I plan to sign up for TPE or attend that exchange as well?

Secondly, I was a biology undergrad, honors college member, and graduated with honors, while working as RA for 1.5 years. I know major isn't a big deal for a SA program, but would I be considered a competitive candidate? (I also know a lot of that comes down to technical stuff like resumes, cover letters, interviews, etc.) but don't want to apply to really competitive programs if I'll be put towards the bottom of the pile right off the bat.

5in04c,Possible SA grad student - need your advice,"Hi all,

I am an international undergraduate student in the US, and am applying for the Master's program in Student Affairs in Higher Education (or similar programs depending on the schools). Even though I'm coming in the SA program with a BBA in Actuarial Science (don't ask how or why, am sponsored for my undergraduate so kinda stuck in this major), I've worked in my university's Admissions Office since sophomore year (loved it, was why I started looking into SA) and also currently working as a part-program assistant for a volunteer group in the International Student Services office. Have also intern in education-related places (volunteered for Teach for Malaysia one summer, intern at [MACEE](http://macee.org.my) for their Fulbright/EducationUSA departments) and did a bunch of education/youth development volunteer programs like [Projek Inspirasi](http://inspirasi.avh.me) in Malaysia.

Universities I applied for (& some decisions that I've received): 

* University of Rochester (admitted, 30% tuition scholarship)
* University of Wisconsin-Madison (recommended for admission, need official transcript to finalize offer)
* Colorado State University (not invited to interview)
* Michigan State University (no results yet) 
* Anglia Ruskin University (in England, UK) (conditional offer, need minimum GPA of 3.0 by graduation next year, highly achievable).

What I'm contemplating right now is if I want to stay and pursue my Master's in the UK or in the US (if the US, I still have to decide which school, but that's a different story). Some thoughts that I consider while thinking this all out:

**1) Funding, obviously.**

While Rochester offers a 30% tuition scholarship, that will still cost me about $35,000 or so in tuition fees. For Madison, tuition cost should be roughly around the $40,000-mark or so, give an take a few thousand. Anglia Ruskin would cost me around GBP12,000, so that's around $15,000. 

I have been on a convertible loan from my country's government for my undergraduate (will probably need to pay back around 10-15% of my total costs including living expenses and all after I graduate). But for my masters, I will mostly be on personal funding (my parents agreed to help me pay for grad school) since there are not many options back home for funding for Education-related program.

**2) Time commitment**

Rochester is a two-year program. Madison is roughly 1.5 to 2 years, depending on how many credits I take per semester (30 credits for their program). Anglia Ruskin is a year-long program. While I don't mind studying for another two years, doing it in a year seems interesting but daunting at the same time.

**3) Education system**

Malaysia follows the British education system (exam-based all throughout high school), and I did A-Levels partly after high school before realizing that I hated how super exam-based it is and switched to a program and applied to the US schools for my undergrad. Super loving the US system and its flexibility, and how it offers me options I didn't know exist for me (seriously, taking a Videogames & Learning course for a Comm B requirement is awesome). But have been told that the UK Master's programs are not the same as the UK Bachelors' programs. Am planning to read up more on how the program is structured and taught, as well as talking to my friends who did Master's in the UK for their experience.

**4) Environment**

I've grown to love the US, and would love to stay and do my Master's here. Been to Rochester, loved the campus and my possible department. People are friendly, diversity is great (as a Muslim, this is highly needed). Even saw a prayer mat in the student lounge while touring and I was so excited. Madison, on the other hand, is my alma mater, and I have friends and people that I know and love. Anglia Ruskin is located in Cambridge, England, and while I've never been to Cambridge specifically, I've lived in London for 1.5 years back when I was younger, and have visited two years ago. Still have friends who are pursuing their undergraduate in England at various places, and some who will still be there if I do my Master's there next September.

The thing is, my parents are worried about me wanting to stay in the US, what with the election results and all that (as a female Muslim who wears the hijab). Personally, I've never experienced anything bad, other than that one time where a white guy suddenly yelled ""F* you"" in my face as I was walking back home (granted, it was 2am in the morning, and he was probably drunk). But my parents, not knowing how things would be next year (or the next two years), are super worried, which was why I actually applied to Anglia Ruskin.

**5) Visa requirements for dependents/spouse**

A little related to the funding issue, since I'm mostly going to be on personal funding. I am now on an F-1 student visa in the US, but would like to be on a J-1 visa for my Master's (mainly because if my spouse were to come and be with me, he can be on a J-2 visa and work part-time instead of staying at home and being idle for two years). But J-1 visa are typically for students sponsored by the university, by government or have substantial funding from anything other than personal (I am asking Rochester about their policy, since I have a 30% tuition scholarship and the form that I was given gave me an option to select J-1 instead of an F-1).

The UK, however, should be easier. As I will be on a Tier 4 student visa, my spouse should be able to come and stay with me (as I am doing a year-long Master's program) and he should be able to work (if I'm not mistaken, if you know more, please let me know!) 

**6) The program itself**

Rochester is one of my top choices because their program is a combination of Educational Administration w/ specialization in Student Affairs and Academic/Career Advising. As I would possibly like to be an education consultant in the future, this would work best with my interests. Madison's Student Affairs program is in their Ed Leadership & Policy Analysis (ELPA) program, which is more policy-based from what I've been told (though I plan to meet with my assigned advisor next semester to learn more and talk about options). Anglia Ruskin's program has a focus on international/national student affairs, which is interesting for an international student like me. It'd be interesting to see things from different countries' perspectives, and would be beneficial considering it can help me adapt to different situations, especially if I go back home and work with students who are interested to apply to schools outside of my home country. Anglia Ruskin also has a possible internship opportunity to work in the US (summer internship?) if I want to apply for it, which would also be fun.


--------

So that's just some of the thoughts I have at the moment. I would be meeting my family next week for a winter trip, and should be discussing all of the options with my parents (after all, they are paying for my education).

At this point, I'm just going through all the pros and cons in my head (and talking it out with my friends to help me think clearly), but I would appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, and ideas from anyone who has any experiences in any of these programs, or know more about the UK vs US thing.

56hpzk,Entering the field with a Bachelor's degree,"Hey everyone. I am graduating college this spring with a bachelors degree in psychology. I considered graduate school - hell, I even did months worth of research all to realize that as of right now, I do not have any interest in continuing my studies right away. I want to enter the workforce and get my life started first. What is your advice for someone in my position? I want to become hired at a college or university in advising. 

* I have 2-3 years worth of experience, including 2 summers of internships.
* This summer I wrote a 32-page proposal regarding PhD committees for the school I worked for.
* I have many courses relating to diversity and inclusion- something I know is very important to the field of higher ed and student affairs.

What is your advice? Thank you. ",studentaffairs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/56hpzk/entering_the_field_with_a_bachelors_degree/,False,,3,"Hi! Since you're graduating in the spring, I wanted to add a few more bits of info, as a professional academic advisor for the past few years. I completed an M.Ed in College Student Personnel (CSP) prior to taking on a FT advising job but have worked with and for incredible advisors who got their degrees after obtaining jobs in the field. 

For me, it was all about the opportunity to go to graduate school without taking on more student loan debt, since graduate students aren't eligible for need based grants like Pell, only federal unsub loans and of course university or programmatic funding and outside scholarships. One perk of your interest in student affairs is many universities with CSP programs are eager to hire CSP students for GAs in many functional areas like Greek Life, Orientation, First Year Initiatives, Residence Life, etc, which often includes a stipend and health insurance on top of tuition. 

Having the opportunity to be a GA while completing graduate school gave me a chance to build a strong network of like-minded future SA folks, find guidance and mentorship from major scholars and practitioners in the field, present at conferences and travel abroad (for class credit, even!), and complete 2 intensive internships in programs I would never have access to otherwise (disability services as part of a D-I NCAA football team). The curriculum for the CSP program I attended was stellar and included stats, assessment, educational and systems theory, intensive counseling training and opportunity for publication. It was undoubtedly the most rewarding 2 years of my 18+ in formal education.

Now, the downside. It has also made me feel overqualified and underutilized for the advising positions i have held during these first few years of post-grad professional life, with little recourse for rapid advancement bc positions like Director/Asst Director require at least 5 years experience. And those of us who love the direct student contact but aren't so keen on becoming administrators are further doomed to toil in the mid-$30k to low-$40k, depending upon the school and location. There's this constant tension that wears on you after awhile. 

I hope this helps you as you decide what path to take towards your career in higher education. Good luck as you apply to advising positions - I would highly recommend that you look at additional departments, in particular Admissions and Res Life, if you want to start your career at a university or liberal arts college located in major cities. 

When writing cover letters, summarize your advising philosophy and articulate how that philosophy informs your practice and can contribute to student retention and persistence. And above all, realize that if you are hired as advisor, no matter how many degrees or internships you've completed, nothing will prepare you for how overwhelmed you will feel for at least the first 6 months. Find an experienced advisor to shadow, read the entire university catalog, and be prepared to cry at least once in a boss or co-workers office. It means you're doing it right!  ",2016-10-09 00:32:45

1nb6y8,Why Did You Choose Student Affairs?,"Hi,

I am a business school graduate working in technology consulting. I graduated with a degree in MIS, but I'm still not sure why I really chose MIS as a degree. Speaking freely, I have a really good GPA/résumé, so I landed a prestigious tech consulting gig making good money for a great company that I love--but my work is terrible. It has no human element. It's essentially programming for 9 or so hours a day. If I make it 5 years, then I'll get more human interaction, but I have no passion for programming. I really feel out of place. 

My passions are counseling (""helping people""), mentoring, event planning, being organized, and leadership. I was involved in leadership throughout my time at my large public university. I always felt though that going back and working for my alma mater or another school was somewhat like tapping out and saying I couldn't handle the ""real world"", no disrespect intended. (Some people perpetuate terrible myths about academia and academic support.)

Well, this past week, I've decided to say screw those who doubt me or my motivations. Screw those who say you ""should do"" this or this ""is practical"". I want to do what I want to do. And though what I hear is a ""fun"" field, student affairs and higher ed admin presents great growth opportunities, and I feel as if it draws on my personal strengths. 

All that said, I've applied for a great SA grad program, but the doubts continually creep back in. I'm at my current job for another 10 months, so I don't have to pay back my bonus and can save for grad school/survive until next fall. It's draining, but I'm learning a lot from it. 

I need your help though. Quitting a job is tough. Especially one that all of my friends and family envy. I'm sold on leaving. I'm an ENFJ, and what my responsibilities are for the first at least three years will drain my poor little ENFJ soul. And if education is my long term career path, I should just go for it. ""Decide what to be and go be it."" - The Avett Brothers. 

Oh, back to helping me. Can you share your stories and how you knew higher ed and/or student affairs was right for you. I'm really looking for encouragement as a trudge along this path towards a career that I think fits me perfectly. I'd love to hear your story though. Tell me what you love about your job. Tell me everything. It will ease my sanity. Any advice is appreciated. 

Kind regards.

gj6rnx,Tuition waivers for Master's programs,"Hi everyone!

I'm a rising undergraduate senior, and I've been considering getting my master's in student affairs with the hopes of working in career development or academic advising. After talking to people in the profession at my university (and reading posts on this sub), I've decided I don't think I want to go to a program that doesn't waive tuition for their graduate assistants. I know that a lot of programs do this, so I wasn't too worried before, but because of the financial hits that universities are taking because of the pandemic and hiring freezes happening, I was wondering how likely it is that schools will still be able to offer tuition waivers for incoming students that would start in Fall 2021. I know that everything is very up in the air, so it's likely that people don't have the answers to that yet, but I don't want to get my hopes up too high if it looks like tuition waivers are going to become a lot less common. 

Any information about this would be a huge help! Thanks!",studentaffairs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/gj6rnx/tuition_waivers_for_masters_programs/,False,,8,"You are correct things are very up in the air right now.

gg141i,What can I do to further my career in higher education while my wife is in medical school?,"**TLDR:** I'm currently pushing papers at a medical school with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field while my wife is in medical school. Due to her program, we will move in Summer 2021, Summer 2023, and possibly 2026 or 2027 to currently unknown locations with about 3 months notice for each. What can I do to stay/become competitive for better positions in Higher Ed/Student Affairs with such constraints?

**Context:** I have 5 years (2 as a student, 3 post-baccalaureate) of experience in student affairs. My first job was amazing, crossed most functional areas of the field, and I doubt I'll have another one like it until I hit mid-level career status. I applied and was accepted to a great Masters program, fully funded with tuition and stipend, but in a bitter twist of luck my wife got into medical school for the same term. Her turning it down or trying to defer while I finished a two-year program would have been career suicide, we can't do long-distance, and the schools are hours apart, so I turned down my acceptance and moved with her last summer. I got a full-time position in administration at the medical school she attends, and it pays the bills and keeps a full-time job that's technically in the field on my resume, but it's a significant step back from where I was - or at least feels like it. Competition for jobs here is fierce, and potential employers know that I'm a short-term (2 years) employee, so I'm glad that I got the job, but it's not what I want. Which leads me to our upcoming moves.

We will be here (with me in the same job) until next summer. Her program will require her to move, probably at least 2 hours away, for clinical rotations starting summer 2021 and I will come with her. Then, in summer 2023, she will graduate and we will move for residency (wherever she matches). Residency will probably last three or four years, after which we may move again.

My priorities are having a fulfilling job and getting a master's degree that will help me advance through the field. Reducing our debt load would be nice, but my wife's program will run our student debt burden into the hundreds of thousands, so really what's another 20k?

**Some of the options I've identified:**

1. There is a Master's program at the local university here, but the program is completely online, with no significant practical experiences, and no assistantships, tuition remission, or stipend. I could do it while keeping my job, and it would cost 10-15k. I would be in-progress by the time we move again (and I search for another job in our new location), and complete it sometime next year after the move.
2. Some of the possible locations for our next move (2021) have local universities, and some of those have a Master's program in my field. Some are online, some are hybrid, but most have better opportunities for funding an assistantships. The pay cut if I could get a stipend would be slight (4-8k difference from my current salary). I would get my Master's by 2022 or 2023, in time for our move for residency in 2023. But, we could end up somewhere without a program available.
3. I could just get a job at our 2021 location, hopefully one that's less administrative and more focused on my goals and trajectory, maybe paying a little bit more, and delay my education until we move for residency in 2023. I'm worried that I won't be competitive for non-administrative jobs without the Master's, so any insight on this would be nice (I'm in Southeastern US). We do get more of a choice for residency, but it's too early in her program to tell how competitive she will be (and thus how much choice we'll get to choose a location with a good program for me). We could end up back where we started, where my original program was (and I'm relatively certain they would take me back if I wanted to reapply for that program). This comes with the same uncertainty of if we don't wind up where we want, I'll have essentially wasted four years pushing paper only to wind up in relatively the same spot with no options for another three or four years, when I could have been getting a degree (even one from a less-great program).

Aside from a traditional degree and 9-5, I'd love ideas on other things to make me more competitive - online/virtual learning, conferences to attend, professional organizations to join, whatever's out there.",studentaffairs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/gg141i/what_can_i_do_to_further_my_career_in_higher/,False,,8,"I would look at option 2...if you are able to squeeze in a master's degree while your wife is in school, this would position you better for after she matches. Don't focus too much on years 2026 and beyond, as many things could change between now and then. 

I am curious, my brother just finished medical school, so I know the context-why is she required to attend rotations 2+ hours away from where you are currently living? Is this an especially rural community perhaps? You didn't mention it, but by working at her school, do you get tuition remission for her? I know med school tuition is crazy, so adding a bit more may not seem like a big deal, (especially given potential salary down the road) but if this is a benefit you are currently afforded, I wouldn't immediately look to work elsewhere.

cvq1j5,Preparing for Academic Advising Interview - Seeking Advice/Tips,"I have made it to the 2nd round for a academic advising job at my beloved undergrad Alma mater. The position also includes support services relevant to educational opportunity programs, specifically for disadvantaged or at-risk students. I have a BS in Psychology, and a M.Ed. in Higher Education and Student Affairs. The minimum requirements for the position are a masters in the field, and experience working with disadvantaged, at-risk, or students enrolled in educational opportunity programs. Preferred is 3 yrs experience with this population. 

I just recently graduated, so my experience is limited to my assistantship, internship, and practicum experience, however I feel that I do have experience working with this population  because of the institution I worked at (high population of low SES, high need and use of free resources, etc.). My assistantship was in Student Activities (at a Small Private Institution; Orientation, Organizations, Greek Life), my practicum in Multicultural Affairs (at a large public institution; think Diversity Retreats and program planning), and my internship in Orientation (at a different large public institution). I also advised a Sorority while in grad school (at the private institution). 

My concern is that while I broadly advised every student organization (50) in my last role, and directly advised a sorority, ... well, I  don't have any ""actual"" advising experience, when it comes to 1 on 1 student advising, especially academically related.  I would love some insights from others who have been in a similar position before. I feel 100% confident that I am able to fulfill any position put in front of me, and I sought out higher ed to become an academic adviser (my grad program wouldn't let anyone without a Masters advise students so I wasn't able to get experience in that area). I'm not an overall confident person, and I know that interviews are my weakness, so I want to make sure I am as prepared as I can be to show my abilities/skills/experience at the interview.

What can I do to prepare? What books can I read to have an edge? How can I ensure they see me ""fit"" in the position?

a60qco,Considering a career change into academic advising/career counseling,"Hi All! I just needed some words of advice on the field of student affairs, specifically academic advising and/or career counseling. Some background on me- I am a business marketing and management graduate and have been working in the HR field for about 4 years now. Essentially, these 4 years in the workforce have been very trial and error, but I finally have discovered my real strengths and passions. I can not see myself making a career in HR and wanting to grow myself further in that. As a result, for about a year or more now, I have been very drawn to student affairs as it aligns my strengths and passions. I will save you all that fluff and just simply ask the following questions. Answers to really any of these would be helpful to me! 

1. What advice would anyone have for trying breaking into this field? I realize this may require me to obtain a masters degree, especially having no experience in the field although I believe there are plenty of skillsets that I can apply from my HR/recruiting background. 
2. Are job prospects good for entry level grads from student affairs programs? 
3. Would academic advising be a job I could obtain right away with this degree, or would I have to work up to it?
4. Academic advising versus career counseling (at the college level). Any insight into the differences on the 2 and what may be better to go into?

&#x200B;",studentaffairs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/a60qco/considering_a_career_change_into_academic/,False,,7,"Hello, I've been an academic advisor at a state school regional campus for almost 2 years now so I can offer some perspective even if it's a little late! I got a bachelor's in Communication and immediately went into a Master's in Education (student affairs) at my alma mater. My 2-year graduate program required 3 internships, two of mine were advising and 1 was career services. This is my first job out of college. 

1. The education level required for entry level academic advisor positions really depends on the school. Some just require a Bachelor's and don't specify a subject. Some positions require a Bachelor's but ""prefer"" a Master's -sometimes in any subject, sometimes they will prefer higher ed/counseling, and some prefer a degree related to the subject they would be advising, which I've seen several times for business and engineering advisor positions. My school required a master's for advisors when I was hired, but the education requirements recently changed to a bachelor's. So you could definitely find advising positions that don't require a master's, and I would imagine most potential employers would consider your work experience valuable, especially for a position advising business students. 
2. Over the last few months of my 2-year program, I applied to about 90 academic advising positions almost exclusively through [higheredjobs.com](https://higheredjobs.com). There are plenty of advising positions on there, but I was also willing to move for a job so I wasn't super picky. Positions are competitive, but I worked hard applying and ended up with lots of interviews and two job offers to choose from. I took this one about a month after I graduated. As far as I know everyone in my cohort got jobs either before graduation or in the summer after. It probably would have been easier for me to find a job if I had had any professional work experience but I at least had the internships. Interviewing does not come easily to me and I hadn't had a lot of experience with it so that was also a challenge when it came to my job search. 
3. You can get a job in advising right out of a student affairs master's program, I heard that advising can be a difficult field to break into for new grads but that's what I wanted so I just kept trying until I got something! 
4. I did consider Career advising but I felt like that would be difficult for me as someone without any other professional work experience to draw upon. But I was pretty much set on advising from the time I started my graduate program, I became interested in the field as an undergraduate student after getting so much guidance from my own advisors. I didn't really know what I wanted to do as an undergraduate student and it took me awhile to settle on my major. I feel like advising is a good fit for me because it is a good mix of working independently and with others. Also I am very detail-oriented and I like structure, which I feel like this position provides. Please let me know if you have any more questions and good luck! ",2018-12-14 10:56:57

You can have people pair up and then talk about their responses to the three questions. Though I would encourage you to dedicate at least 30 mins to an hour for this. Good luck!

a34u3y,Why does the Student Affairs Job Search take so long? I did some research and am happy to share it here!,,studentaffairs,6,https://www.jobhakr.com/blog-1/2018/10/19/why-does-the-student-affairs-job-search-take-so-long,False,,8,"[The study you cite](https://www.higheredjobs.com/articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=669) that found the 119-day length only included participants who ""were master's students in their last semester of school"". You also include a lot of discussion on the roles of committees, going so far as to assert that, ""large companies often employ human resource professionals whose entire jobs are to fill these vacant slots. However, in higher education, we don’t task a single person for this important duty. That is only trusted to...committees"". 

&#x200B;

I really appreciate the positive, encouraging, and helpful tone of your article, but it doesn't feel to me like you quite hit the mark for the question you're really asking --""Why does the Student Affairs Job Search take so long?""

&#x200B;

\-Many, many institutions do in fact have dedicated recruiters within their centralized HR departments. Those that don't often have HR staff who do have talent acquisition responsibilities in their job description.

\-Many --if not most-- of the entry level SAs jobs I've seen at various institutions do not go to a committee.

\-Committees are usually pulled together for Director-level and above jobs.

\-That ""119 days"" figure came from a study that only included students in their last year of a grad program; my experience tells me that many --again, if not most-- of them are being hired into ""coordinator"", ""specialist"", ""assistant"", or other similar roles that involve little to no management components. 

&#x200B;

My assumption, based on about 10 years of anecdotal experience in HigherEd HR and Career Development, is that most of those 258 participants did not go before committees for the roles they were considered for and eventually hired into. 

&#x200B;

In my experience, the length of the search strongly corresponds with the behaviors of the seeker; those who simply mass apply --even with ***great*** resumes and cover letters-- will take much longer to land a job than those who tap into their network. 

&#x200B;

When I work my clients I routinely ask them this question: ""If you go to bed proud on a Friday night because you did a great job as a job-seeker that week, what evidence would you put forward to support your sense of accomplishment?""

&#x200B;

9/10 they say something like, ""I applied to X amount of jobs"". 

&#x200B;

There needs to be a paradigm shift here! Applying to 10, 20, or even 50 jobs is not success. In fact, it is frequently failure; it burns you out, keeps you from actually pursuing feasible opportunities, and prevents you from using your valuable time in more impactful ways.   


I challenge my clients to shift their thinking away from ""jobs I applied to"" to ""people I spoke with"". 

&#x200B;

Sure, it depends on the geographic location, the position, and an individual's reputation/experience...but the vast majority of job-seekers land jobs where they had a warm lead. 

&#x200B;

As a job-seeker, if you aren't A) getting coffee with one of your potential future colleagues, B) conducting informational interviews with the leaders of the offices you want to apply to, C) or targeting roles at institutions that have staff members you know and who will vouch for you then you are doing it the hard way. 

&#x200B;

You can have a 99% perfect resume and cover letter. But, in an applicant pool of 89 people...several of those people may also be in the 90%-99% perfect range. So, who gets interviewed and hired? The applicants who get attention! And the easiest and most compelling attention comes from an internal reference. I'll interview the 90% perfect applicant on paper who comes highly recommended by someone I trust much sooner than the 95% perfect applicant I've never heard of. Again, especially in crowded applicant pools with 15 or 20 reasonably qualified applicants.  ",2018-12-05 05:01:31

6a3e4d,Discovered my calling and want to become an academic adviser! Can anyone give some advice on how to start?,"Hey everyone, if you're reading this, thank you :). It's a bit lengthy, so if you stick to reading this, I appreciate you :)

TL;DR, want to be an adviser, have an opportunity at a for-profit college...

 I'm a senior majoring in History, and working on a Master's degree in International Studies as part of a combined degree program.

**BRIEF BACKGROUND**

I've had a varied work history, from a big red retail store, to working as an intern for a senator, to software QA, to my current position. I was never able to truly find my groove as you can see. I found myself wanting to be part of academia in some capacity, but never quite sure as to what or how.

I currently work at a community college as an IT lab assistant for one of the computer labs on campus, which is essentially a supervisor role for the lab in which I engage student with their inquiries and check operations.

It's a slow job, but I found that the most exciting part of the day is helping students to solve their problems and make life a little easier for them. I've came to the realization that I'd like to be an academic adviser after a lengthy conversation with my own. I've discovered it to be my own little passion.

Part of it stems from my own experiences in school, having grown up in a high-risk school in Chicago. I want people to have the opportunities I almost never had, and the opportunities many cannot be granted. 

**SO, WHAT THEN?**

I can start at Devry University during the summer as a Student Support adviser. While my mind is in it, my heart is not, considering the nature of the school as a for-profit, and the ultimate goal is *not* the student, but rather, the dollar.

I want to find myself working as an adviser in a university or community college and moving upwards to have a positive influence on a school's operations. The more I think about it, the more I want to provide students with an experience that could encourage others to be in my position.

I've considered looking at NACADA and meeting with advisers at the college I work for! Can anyone else give me some advice!

**Quick resume summary**

3.5 year total work history in (5 month retail, 2 years in software QA, interned for 3 months, 1.1 years in higher ed)

It was also my first big girl job, so it provided lots of opportunities for personal/professional growth. I personally worked there focused on helping my students/gradutes, but there was always pressure from above regarding meeting numbers on a weekly/monthly basis (numbers - graduates getting hired in their field). The pressure really felt draining, especially before final yearly accreditation reporting, but I wanted to focus on my students' professional development so they could be the most qualified applicants for positions.

5nybbh,Grad School in SA or Higher Ed?,"I'm so conflicted. 

I'm trying to decide what avenue to pursue in terms of grad school (SA or Higher Ed). I really love working with students, but I also like the administrative side of things. I've been a student academic peer advisor during my undergrad (and seriously loved it), and now I work at a University Department part-time as a student services coordinator where I get to do a little student advising as well as many administrative duties. 

I fear that an SA degree isn't as prestigious (sorry, guys) as a higher ed degree, and I really have no interest in working in many areas of student affairs (basically only academic or career advising appeal to me). 

I found a program for a [graduate advising certificate](http://catalog.emich.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=21&poid=10724) which would only be a 2 semester commitment, and then if I wanted to, I could could focus on a longer higher education degree afterwards. 

I think this is the route that would best suite me and my interests, but I wanted to get your take on this. Especially what you think the value of this graduate certificate in advising is compared to say a masters in SA with a concentration in advising. 


I should add that I plan on talking to the academic advisor on staff in the department I work in, as she very well might know current trends in school, and what universities are looking for in advising applicants.

5f32kb,Some concerns from a high schooler,"Hello /r/studentaffairs,


I am a teenager in his late teens, and naturally, I am concerned about post-secondary education. However, this isn’t about what should I expect, or any other typical questions that a high schooler has. But this is about some concerns with policies that are enforced on campuses like Penn. State, Yale, etc. Those policies are“safe spaces” (more importantly), memos about non-biased phrases, trigger warnings, and other politically correct rules. Now, I can see some legitimate grounds were these policies were established, but for the most part, it seems like this is just a way to silence opposing opinions. 


The reason why I considered this as concerning, is because from what I imagined as a college or university campus: very challenging, extremely exhausting, and yet, philosophical and a way to broaden avenues of thinking. But these safe spaces and guides to unbiased speech seems like the opposite. A way to not shield yourself, but to completely separate yourself from those very concepts. Yes, no will deny that life as a college student, or life as a whole, can be awful time-to-time at the least. But you are supposed to overcome those challenges. From those burdens and challenges, you grow a better work ethic, while thinking more critically.


Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t entirely that bad to me. I could understand that some could feel out of place and want to go to a place where they feel more comfortable. That by itself, seems like a perfectly just reason to provide safe spaces, but to be honest, I’d more inclined under a different label than “safe spaces.” But these places seem like they are used to completely remove  yourself from reality. A place where no one will criticize you, regardless if you’re in the wrong, or were giving terrible points. A place where black students can separate themselves from white students, and where female students and transgender students can separate from male students and no one else. That alone, should be highly discouraged at the minimum. This doesn’t seem like an environment that is very good for an education. I don’t think a place where my freedom of speech is restrained, and any opposing opinions I might have will be dismissed, is considered an optimal learning environment.


Anyways, I know this won’t apply to all schools. I’d imagine that you’ll won’t see protests hosted by feminists at a technical school where people earn welding certifications and engineering degrees. But am I wrong? Am I overreacting? I’d appreciate some thoughtful comments.
",studentaffairs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/5f32kb/some_concerns_from_a_high_schooler/,False,,5,"When you're in college you might realize that home is not a safe place for everyone. The place where you can't escape before being sent to a campus isn't one that you necessarily want to go back to every day. 
Without some sort of safe space, a lot of the ""challenging philosophical views"" college is known for just can't bloom. It's the concept of a secure base: you need a place to come back to once you stop exploring, otherwise you won't have the support you need to do so. You might learn about this in a Psychology or Philosophy class.

Sure, it seems really easy to just blame it on political correctness and the weakening of youth; and fuck, some of it has legitimacy. Some people go way too far on making sure everyone is their own flavor of special, and it separates people a lot more than it's worth. But you have to be careful not to deny others the right to enjoy college as much as you would.

From the tone of your post I'm guessing you don't really need or identify with anything that would grant you a ""safe space"", so maybe this isn't really the answer you were looking for. Just please remember every individual in every college campus has their own needs and wants. You might not have a need or even understand why safe places are important or necessary, but others do. It's as basic as respect and as complicated as the definition of ""safe"" for everyone.

tl;dr: Your freedom of speech is perfectly fine, but freedom of speech doesn't cover freedom to disregard one's mental fortitude and marginalize others. That's all it is. ",2016-11-27 10:19:42

4bos8z,New graduate with BSc in Computer Science considering Student Affairs,"I just finished up undergrad with a BSc in Computer Science and I'm giving some consideration to going to grad school and pursuing a career in Student Affairs.

Would I be a marketable candidate for these types of positions (or grad school to begin with) considering my Computer Science undergrad?

In 2011 I moved from the East coast to California and the state was still massively cutting budgets. I said ""fuck that noise"" and didn't bother applying to jobs at any of the local universities (I had 3 years full-time experience). I focused on finding a job, any job that wasn't retail or food-service, landed at an amazing financial advisory firm for 2 years, and focused on having a kid. Right around when she turned 1 (end of 2014), I got the itch to find a job in student affairs again. 

One thing lead to another, we had the opportunity to sell everything and live/travel in an RV, so we're currently doing that. In the meantime, I'm trying to branch out my skills. I'm trying to write a fiction novel. I'm trying to learn some advanced computer skills so I can design websites and help my husband develop apps. 

I guess my advice to you, if you're dead set on returning to student affairs, is to try alternative ways to get your foot in the door. You should have the knowledge and the experience to land jobs, so focus on networking opportunities. See if there are any part-time opportunities (if you can solve the child-care issue), like tutoring, mentoring, volunteering, temp-pool, etc. Work your network and see if you have any degree of connection with anyone on campus that you can develop into a friendship. Maybe take a class at one of your local colleges and get involved in campus as a student (so all the SA professionals get to know your name and face).

3ug9x9,International Student Advising- is a student affairs degree what I need?,"Hi, I'm new here.
I'm interested in working in international student services/programs for a university, most likely in the US.  I'm interested in international student advising, but I'm contemplating international student services in general, as well as programs like English for international students or study abroad (not necessarily working directly for a university).  I currently live in Japan and am also contemplating related jobs that I could do here (or overseas in general).  

So, my title question asked in a little more detail:  
I have this image in my head that advising is a very specific focus that I would need to decide on from the very beginning.  I think that international student advising is what I am most interested in but I also want to be flexible. 

Does international student advising fall under student affairs in the first place, or should I be looking at other, completely different programs, like perhaps counseling?

Will a student affairs degree with a focus on international student services/programs (as opposed to advising) allow me to do advising within that field, among other things?  

Does such flexibility/mobility within the field even exist, or do I need to have a clear job goal even within, say, international student services/programs upon applying anyway?  I know I am interested in the field, but I'm not sure I want to limit myself to advising.

I apologize if that is one too many questions at once, and I feel that I could word them a little better, but I would really appreciate any comment.  Thank you in advance.",studentaffairs,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/3ug9x9/international_student_advising_is_a_student/,False,,7,"I've worked in international student advising for several years. I came from a student affairs/advising background but in my experience international student advising deals a lot with immigration policy in addition to student development/affairs. When it comes to departments that deal with international students, they do tend to be a bit of their own world, even when housed under student affairs, given the bureaucratic issues of having to deal so much with SEVP and DHS policy, and the of course SEVIS. In short, international experience is important, but the demonstrated ability to understand, interpret, and work within complicated and changing federal regulations is also very important. This is where having our own professional organization (NAFSA) is very helpful as they have some helpful government connections and the ability to clearly interpret the Federal Code of Regulations into English ;) ",2015-11-27 18:08:28

2zbl42,Update: Trying to get back into Student Affairs after 3 years in the private sector,"Thanks to some truly amazing people in this sub, I've been able to fine-tune my resume and begin my job-search in earnest.

While I was initially wanting one of two specific cities, I have since used up all possible agent slots at HigherEdJobs.com and picked 8 major cities with a large number of higher education institutions, fantastic public transportation, and generally seem like fun places to live.  My 10 job agents are Lexington and Louisville, KY to be close to family, New Orleans to stay local, New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, and Philadelphia, PA.

I've gone from applying for one job a week to applying for 3 a day.  I'm excited.  I'm fully confident that by the time the next school year starts I will be back in Higher Education where I belong.

Some tips that people shared that I think deserve repeating:

- Some institutions are toxic.  Just because you had a bad experience at one institution does not mean that Student Affairs is not the field for you.  It just means that the institution its self could have been a poor fit.
- Make sure you have a career trajectory in mind.  It is far too easy (especially in this economy) to stagnate in one job and position out of fear of being unemployed.  If there is no upward mobility in a position, it might be time to look elsewhere.
- Career development and mentorship opportunities should be a key factor in selecting potential employment.  Sometimes it is worth making a little less if there is opportunity for long-term growth.

There was so much more advice given, but those aspects really stuck out to me.

I am a second year graduate student (MS in Counselor Education with a focus in Student Development in Higher Education) and I am starting to prepare for the job search. I will not be able to relocate very far for this first job.

All my jobs ever since I graduated in 2014 have been in social services ie: case manager for social services agency, administrative aide for housing agency, career coach for non profit and currently, career specialist for a non profit. At my current job, I work with high school students in the realms of college and career readiness. I do believe this role gave me many transferrable skills because I help these kids with college application process, FAFSA application, scholarships, etc.  

I've been at my current job for about a year and a half now and I thought, this experience would be enough for me to have at least a very basic entry level job at a university. However, it still hasn't happened. In the span of 5 years, I have managed to secure only 2 job interviews at a private university (and got rejected by the same university twice :( )

&#x200B;

Anyways, I am rambling. I guess my point is, do I even have a shot at finding a job in higher education? Is every single academic advisors and other student affairs personnels have background in higher education and that's why you are able to get a job there? Is there anyone else that's in the same boat as me? It seems like every professional that I have had informational interview with has that traditional pathway: worked as peer advisor during undergrad, got hired full time at said institution, then went back to grad school while working full time. I have yet to find anyone that works in higher ed with non traditional background, but maybe because the industry itself is not there yet?

Thank you everyone, sorry for the very long post. I'm just trying to do as much research as possible.",studentaffairs,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/d65k7d/advice_for_getting_my_foot_in_the_door/,False,,7,"Academic advising is a very niche area but I think it sounds like you have a lot of transferable experience. There are going to be certain positions (even ones that seem like they are more entry-level) where the minimum qualifications are still going to require you to have direct higher ed level experience. 

What I have found in my experience (about 7-8 years in academic advising) is that more entry level positions in higher ed tend to come from areas such as Admissions/Recruiting/Enrollment Management. These roles sometimes require quite a bit of traveling away from the main campus during recruiting ""seasons"" which is generally the whole fall (Sept-November), but they provide a LOT of the transferable skills required for academic advising. 

You may also want to look at colleges and universities that have academic or career support roles that are funded by federal programs such as TRIO. These are generally more ""counseling"" or personal support based roles that provide a lot of that ""human"" support for underrepresented populations, particularly towards students who come from either a first generation or low socioeconomic background.

Also as other posters have mentioned, a fallback might ultimately be to look towards office admin type roles. But make sure it is a truly student-centered and student-focused office (academic advising/student services).

With any of these types of positions, I definitely suggest informational interviews. This will give you insight into what the university is looking for in candidates for specific types of roles. ",2019-09-19 07:34:44

My current institution requires as master’s in counseling to be an academic advisor. We also have advising specialist positions that have a similar role without the master’s in counseling. So I agree with others that you may eventually need a master’s to get that dream advising job.

b6cjzt,Creepy Maintenance Man,"So I won’t say my real name, but my nickname is Daisy. I’ll give my friends fake names also, to protect them. I am a student in university and I am in accommodation with 4 girls, everything is sort of going well. 

But we’ve really bad problems with this particular maintenance guy, that arrived just after Christmas, he’s very passive aggressive, rude to all 4 of us, and he’s very into special treatment of one girl, my roommate Lana, they’re from the same country and she is studying abroad. 

But it got pretty strange how the first time he came to inspect something, he just decided to sit down with Lana and her friend on the couch and make himself comfortable, and talked about how he used to pick up girls back home. 

It gets worse 

Queue him coming in for things that don’t make sense? We don’t report any problems and he literally just says “Oh I’m here to fix so-so.” But we all talk and we haven’t had any email about something needing to be fixed, and nobody has reported it. 

I remember not that long ago, Lana came in from university, and walked to the kitchen and he was just sat there; his music on full blast and said he was “taking a break because the flat down the hallway had a flood. “ Yep, that’s right, he just entered our flat when nobody was there and made himself comfy! What the fuck? 

We don’t even report any issues or technical problems, and he still comes around. Weird things he does like, leaving flour on our unit on pancake day, TWICE. 

What should I do? my other friends Amelia, and Lucy are the most willing to take action, while my other roommate, Rose who’s hardly ever here doesn’t want to because she’s leaving soon 😒 and Lana, my other roommate is very freaked out also, she’s his main focus, he comes in, let’s himself in JUST TO SEE HER? But she’s from abroad and dealing with a lot, so I don’t want to see her hurt. 

But honestly, I have no idea what this guy is capable of. He has keys to our flat door, our rooms and we’re all out most of the days, so I don’t know what he does do when we’re not here. 😬

8homvo,Burnout at a new job,"Hi all,

I've worked in SA for 5 1/2 years now.  I recently finished a masters in higher ed.  Immediately after finishing, I got a new job doing similar work to what I have done previously.

Been here almost 6 months and I find that this job is greatly affecting my mental health.  I  like my coworkers but I am not using any of my previous experience or knowledge, and I am not doing the things I actually like doing.  It feels like a waste of my time, and of my employer's time.  I accepted the job because I was desperate to have a job upon receiving my degree but also thought I might be alright at it, as I had dabbled a bit in this aspect of my field.

It is hard to explain without getting too detailed but I do not believe in the work I am doing, nor do I think it is helping students.  I also have very little student interaction compared to previous jobs, and that is what truly drives me in this field.  My supervisor is also almost nonexistent, and I received little to no training for the job.  My office is very concerned with prestige and numbers, and I find the lack of 'intentionality' in our programming, as well as the lack of accessibility to students, very frustrating.  I also don't feel like I have much of a voice at my office.

I am struggling to stay afloat.  I feel crushed by anxiety, stress, and dread.  I honestly feel like I rushed into this job and need some time to decompress and put more effort into the job search during its peak (spring) when more opportunities are available.  I want to take a few months to take care of myself and be the best SA worker I can be, which I do not think I am capable of now.

Would my career in SA be destroyed if I left this job now?  Would this be a true 'burning of the bridge' and screw me over?  I want to remain in this field and also in this geographic location but man, I feel that it benefits no one (myself or my employer) for me to stay in this position.

80xdbv,HR trends noticed,"Hi guys, I've been job hunting for nearly two years now (ICK). I've noticed two strange trends after interviews:
1) some places don't let you know they've gone with someone else. They literally ghost you, after you took the time to interview with them (and apply, and research, etc.) It's disturbing that SAPros would act this unprofessional in such a small field (I wouldn't recommend, for instance, applying to those places, or even going there. And I'm location-bound, so when I do get a job, I'm less likely to trust a place with my students that can't be bothered to send me a two minute email of ""thanks but no thanks"".)
2) sometimes when I don't get a job, I look back after a while to see who did. I figure it doesn't hurt to see maybe what that person has that I don't. Who I've seen lately getting hired is someone who's 50 or older getting the job, usually without a master's, OR someone who's my age but has absolutely no student affairs experience. 

My questions are: is anyone else noticing these trends? (ghosting, hiring those without experience or education, hiring those who are likely to retire sooner than later). And: what the heck can I do about any of this, if anything? Thanks in advance.",studentaffairs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/80xdbv/hr_trends_noticed/,False,,12,"https://www.fastcompany.com/3069166/i-built-a-bot-to-apply-to-thousands-of-jobs-at-once-heres-what-i-learned

It's not what you know, it's **who**.  

85% of critical hires are through referrals.  The online application system are completely useless and all for show.

""Out-of-the-box hires rarely happen through LinkedIn applications. They happen when someone influential meets a really interesting person and says, ‘Let’s create a position for you.'""


**Less Applying, More Networking**

So where has this left me, aside from somewhat disheartened? Well, for one thing, it leaves me a little bit wiser. As my faith in the front-facing application process eroded into near oblivion, I learned three lessons by robotically applying to thousands of jobs:

1.  It’s not how you apply, it’s who you know. And if you don’t know someone, don’t bother.

2.  Companies are trying to fill a position with minimal risk, not discover someone who breaks the mold.

3.  The number of jobs you apply to has no correlation to whether you’ll be considered, and you won’t be considered for jobs you don’t get the chance to apply to.

7lixvc,Introverted SA Functional Areas- Assistantship Selection,"I have applied for graduate schools at four institutions and now assistantships are coming out full swing. I have taken a big picture perusal of some of the different assistantships that are offered. Although I have not received official confirmation of being accepted or being invited to an interview I have begun looking at what's available. In addition, I received a lot of advice on how to pick assistantships. I was reading something on the sub and online and I saw something about introversion and being and introvert myself, I know my limits and where I can stretch myself. Now I know you may be saying, ""You have to get used to some extroversion"" which I am aware of. There are some preferences I am looking for in my work environment:

*Office- No open office environments- someone what semi-private.
*Personal connections- I desire to work with students one-on-one in advising/counseling settings. Although I can navigate small talk, it is something I do not care for.
*Areas of self-reflection where I can think, read, brainstorm, planning, writing, and reflect to help execute best practices and contribute to the office I want to work for. Also, a place where we can process thoughts and feelings
*Public speaking/Teaching- Public speaking a big weakness of mine and I know it's something that I have to improve if I ever get asked. However, doing it on a daily basis is not for me as it will dry my batteries completely. Large audiences (no. Done it before in front of 4,500+ and it was the most nerve-wracking thing ever) Teaching I would not mind doing if it were a small group setting.
*Supervision and management- Although I have expereince in it, my approach is very laid back. I lay out the expectations, and I can trust whoever I supervise that they can follow; however, I don't like being a micromanager.
*No frequent networking- I know how to turn on my extroversion when needed, but doing it everyday would be too much (this is at networking events and conferences)
*Surface level transactional advising- one word: no. Deep-interactions matter 

So I am trying to find functional areas to look for when keeping this all in mind. My initial thought for functional areas to go into are:

*counseling (an area I am interested in, not sure as a career)
*career services (I think would fit well with my goal to become a college planning consultant, this all depends on the job description asked)
*academic advising/services (Great as well!)
*Admissions & Enrollment (I think it would enhance my goals to understand about admissions, but again the public speaking in large audiences is the only thing I am concerned about. Fairs are not as much of a concern to me.
*Multiculutral Student Services (Since colleges may have different functions, I would prefer something in diversity education or peer mentoring)
*Disability Services and Resources ( Maybe something in  disability advocacy- working one on one with students and helping students meet their needs.)
*Financial Aid and Scholarships (This would be an area for practicum to aid my goal as a consultant, but may not long-term.

These are a lot of ideas I was thinking that would fit well with my introversion. I was wondering if there are any functional areas that are good for introverts that I have not considered?
",studentaffairs,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/7lixvc/introverted_sa_functional_areas_assistantship/,False,,1,"From one introvert to another, I absolutely hear where you're coming from. However, it's hard to pin down some of your preferences, as they absolutely vary by position and office, looking dramatically different between institutions. To address each of your criterion point by point:

Offices: As a grad, your possible office spaces will vary widely from a single space that might be shared by multiple grads to a giant cubicle that has 5-6 grads crammed in. In my particular office, both myself and a co-grad have our own desks in one office, but our schedules hardly overlap.

Personal connections: Your students will come to you with a variety of needs, ranging from academic, to professional as part of their leadership roles. Sometimes, life just happens and they might need to seek advice about any old thing. Small talk will happen -- and does have its benefits. That's just something you'll have to accept. Some days you might have really shallow, surface-level interactions. Other days you might delve deep with someone and engage in a meaningful dialogue -- the ebb and flow is all natural.

Self-reflection: The majority of assistantship experiences, especially those based out of a student affairs unit will have *plenty* of opportunities for self-reflection. Seriously, you have nothing to worry about there. ~~Sometimes I feel like my entire degree and assistantship can be reduced to arts and crafts and reflection.~~ 

Public speaking/teaching: The majority of my interactions have ranged from 1:1s to my staff of 20 RAs. The one time I spoke to a larger group was when I volunteered to present a training sessions for RAs. Teaching won't inherently be expected of you -- there *might* be an assistantship or two in your program that requires teaching, but the assistantship provider would be upfront about that, both in the position description and in the interview. In my case, I have chosen to teach a course on residential leadership that all RA applicants at my school must take.

Supervision and management: I hate to say it, but most students will need more than ""I trust them to do their job."" At the end of the day, it's just business, and there will be certain things that have to get done. Your boss will never say ""Oh darn, RA X didn't get the work done."" It'll be more like ""HESAHodges, why didn't this task get done?""

Networking: Definitely a matter of choosing your own level of challenge and discomfort. No one will ever force you to develop professional connections, but it's in your best interest to do whatever best suits your needs. Digital networking is particularly salient in our field (Check out #SAchat and #SAgrad on Twitter). There are plenty of higher education related hash tags, and I've met some great colleagues through Twitter.

I think it's great that you've thought about different functional areas, but I'm not sure how much use it'll be to you in the long run. Overall, each unique position and associated expectations will shape your experience much more than thinking about each assistantship in terms of functional areas.

These were just some of my quickly jotted down words. Let me know if you have any other questions! Feel free to DM directly as well.

Cheers. ",2017-12-23 01:40:25

7b1o7o,Potential to finish grad program in 1 year instead of 2. Thoughts?,"So, my title is pretty self explanatory.  I have crunched the numbers and at the rate I am going with my Higher Ed program, I can easily finish by taking 1-2 classes during my summer 2018 session.  I have a Graduate Assistantship in Career Services that could be extended for a 2nd year (if needed), as well as I have been interning in Academic Advising & Career Services at another university since June.  

Upon finishing my program this July, I would have a little over 1 year of GA experience and 1 year of Internship experience in Career/Academic Advising which is what I want to pursue a career in.  I am looking to stay within the midwest but am not opposed to moving cities or nearby states, and am really open to any type of institution at this point.  I more so am worried about getting a role where I advise students in some capacity so I can continue to develop that area of my career. 

My biggest question is do you all think I should stretch my program to two years so I have 2 years of GA and Internship experiences? I am also worried that finishing in mid-july may hinder my job search process. I can do my last classes online which means I could start a job in May if they are willing to let me begin while finishing my last class of my degree.   Would it be smarter to stay in school and finish May of 2019 and just graduate with way more credits than I need to take but have more experience? I know getting into advising right out of school is tough, so I want to make the right choice but also not live the poor grad student life for another year if I do not need to.

Is this just an anomaly common in the geographical area I'm searching for jobs (Pacific Northwest) or is this common all across the country? I'm looking at both entry level SA jobs and mid-level jobs, because my experience puts me on the cusp of both those levels... yay. I kinda expect it more for upper level jobs, and not so much for fresh out of grad school jobs.

I spent one semester as a live-in grad assistant and am now desperately trying to get back into res life as a full-time professional.  I absolutely loved it.  My school (as I think most do) has an on-call duty rotation.  So, for one week out of a month or two, you are on call 24/7.  Besides that month, while you are still responsible for anything urgent arising in your hall while you are at home, you're mostly only expected to be 'at work' during your office hours.  

Being right in among the students is what make the live-in positions so fun.  If you want to keep to yourself, you stay in your apartment, but if you're feeling social you can head down to your hall's common area and chill out with the students.  I liked to do a coffee time where I made coffee for the hall and everyone got to sit around and have some community time.  The sky is really the limit as far as things you can do to help foster a positive atmosphere in your hall.

Tinfoil hat: Unfortunately in this field, sometimes you could have unconsciously rubbed SOMEONE the wrong way in the past that has influence over the hiring decision, or just doesn't like yo' face! For instance, if you're applying for another department, and that department head wasn't a fan of your old supervisor, they may end up being petty and nuking any resume form your department that comes through, regardless of how awesome you are.

On the other end of the spectrum, you could be applying at a place that has a lot of applicants with more experience than you. Even though you worked there, the university/etc might be looking for more experience, or just new blood. You never know.

How's the search been? ",2016-06-14 10:11:51

4drqjz,Need help deciding on a Higher Education Masters Program. And advice would help.,"I just interviewed for a graduate assistant position that unfortunately does not pay for graduate school. I'm okay with it though because I am excited about the opportunity. I started looking into programs nearby, but nothing is close enough to where I will be. Which leaves me with online programs. So I have two questions. Is an online degree okay? And specifically an online degree from Walden University. I'm on a budget and the program can be done at a reasonable price. 

Thank you in advance for the advice!

Edit: I was asked to describe the asstantship a little. I would be a GA for there's life department. I would be responsible for 1 of the buildings on campus and would participate in the on all rotation. I would also have my own RAs that I am responsible for hiring and training. They give me a fully furnished apartment, a meal plan, and I work 20 hours a week for a monthly stipend. They do not have a masters in higher ed at the campus, so is have to travel to another school 

Edit 2: I've totally taken walden out of the thought process. I appreciate all the input! ",studentaffairs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/4drqjz/need_help_deciding_on_a_higher_education_masters/,False,,5,"I see a couple of hiccups with this plan. 

1) A *huge* part of what makes grad school a benefit for students is the chance to get experience alongside your coursework through assistantships, practica, etc.  If you do an online degree, you're missing out on that experience, and will be going up against students from traditional programs who have 1-2 years of assistantship experience under their belt.  As someone who sits on entry-level hiring committees frequently, a candidate with an online degree is rarely seriously considered.  

2) I'd steer clear of Walden for sure.  People in higher ed tend to be very against for-profit institutions, for lots of good reasons.  At best, it will have no impact.  At worst, it will disqualify you from positions immediately. 

Similar to other posters, I am also confused about this assistantship that isn't paying for your graduate school.  If you can explain that a little more, we might be able to give you better advice! ",2016-04-08 00:09:24
4cat7n,I have to make a decision between two schools one is my perfect school (I'd have to take some loans ($12k)) or go to my local public university and graduate debt free. Can you give me some advice on which route to go?,"I plan on majoring in finance and breaking into investment banking after University. 

So I got accepted into Trinity University and the University of Houston. Trinity University costs $52k a year tuition, room, board, and fees. However I was awarded enough to make it cost $19k a year, but part of of my award money is a $12k scholarship. UH tuition and fees and food and activities is about $13.5k a year and I'd be staying at home and commuting to campus. 

I like everything there is at Trinity, if I go there I will be recruited by the swim team, and get to continue swimming which I absolutely love. I also love the small class sizes and small campus at Trinity, and the fact that I would be able to get away from home. 

In both cases my parents will cover tuition costs up to about $15k, but that is all they can afford. So I'll have to work a summer job to get some extra money for trinity, which I'm fine doing. I'll also have to graduate with some student loans.

My plan to pay off my student loans is to work in Houston after graduation and live with my parents till I pay off all my loans. 

Is Trinity University worth taking out a loan for?",studentaffairs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/4cat7n/i_have_to_make_a_decision_between_two_schools_one/,False,,2,"I'm a practical person, and student debt is no joke. So, I am inclined to pick Houston for a few reasons.

1) See reasons from /u/simmelianben - you can have a great college experience anywhere because it's all what you make of it. I don't think paying 4x as much equals a 4x better experience.

2) A larger university is better for networking than a smaller one, and you're planning on going into business where networking is SO important. I've honestly never heard of Trinity but am familiar with Houston, and expect future employers will be as well. Houston will have a larger alumni network, more employers recruiting for internships, and increased recognizability when you're looking for a job.

3) You are thinking about going into finance/investment banking, which is a relatively lucrative field. But, what if you go to college and realize you hate business classes? Or that you're not good at them? Or that you want to do something else? Most students change their major or career path and college, and I would hate for you to be at Trinity, taking out student loans, and end up in a lower paying career where it will be extremely difficult to pay them off.

Everyone wants the ideal most perfect college experience, but quite frankly, it's not worth the money. Think about it in terms of a car - sure, a $100,000 mercedes would be pretty sweet to drive around. But purchasing a $25,000 toyota makes much more sense and will still provide you with a great ride that you won't regret later. ",2016-03-29 00:13:41

342if3,Would you accept a newly-created Hall Director position when the students are avidly opposed to the creation of your position? (x-post /r/reslife),"I'm interviewing for a live-in, full time Hall Director position in a residence hall at an ""elite"" private university. At first I was really excited because the university's students have a reputation for being very smart and creative. However, the Hall Director position is new - my understanding is that historically, faculty and graduate students without professional Student Affairs training lived in the dorms and fulfilled some of the functions of a Hall Director. The university has been phasing Hall Directors in over the past few years, receiving what I have heard and read appears to be a fair amount of resistance from students as well as the live-in faculty and graduate students. 

They have left the most resistant residence halls for last, and I'm interviewing for one of those positions. I'm worried that it will be a hostile work environment, as there appears to be a lot of tension between students and ResLife staff. 

During the interviews I have been trying to better understand the environment, but everything is very polarized and the other ResLife staff just seem to be of the opinion that the students are not reasonable and I shouldn't pay them much attention when deciding whether to accept the job. But, my job is supposedly to work with these students!

Also, make sure you wear shoes that you are comfortable walking around in, since you will probably spend a good bit of time touring at least the offices if not the entire campus. Also, if time allows, get your shoes shined at the airport while you wait to fly out. They will look brand new but will maintain the comfort of having worn them for your trip.

You are going to sit in a lot of different interviews with different groups, so you will probably want to have specific questions for specific groups. For example, you will probably meet with a group of students, so think of 3-4 things that only they could speak to, or that you want their specific take on. What do you want to know from the person who supervises this position? What about from the director of the department? Try not to ask the same questions of every group, they will talk about what questions you asked after you leave and you don't want them talking about how you only asked the same 3 things all day. 

Carry a light bag, something that you can keep with you but wont be uncomfortable to carry on a long walk.

Order a salad with light dressing or something else that is not messy and can easily be eaten while conversing with people, since you will probably be interviewed over lunch. You want to be full enough to keep going but not overly stuffed/sluggish after lunch.

Anything more than this will probably depend on the type of job for which you are applying. Good luck.

1e5f7u,"Looking at switching from ""academia"" to ""higher education"".","I'm currently finishing up my Master's in Linguistics. After considering switching to Anthropology because I'm interested in identity, especially multicultural and minority identities, I've decided that the path to a tenured position just isn't in me and I would be better off working directly with the communities that I would like to work with by going into student affairs and higher education.

As an undergrad I was hired as an early hire (freshman year) as a paraprofessional (RA) for a few years and was a Resident Manager, managing three residence hall desks at The Ohio State Univeristy. I loved my years in housing and would love to return to doing work that is similar to that (though I completely understand that running a multicultural center or being a hall director is far beyond being responsible for 72 residents as an RA). 

I was wondering what programs (Master's) you could point me to that are strong in research and in implementing programs for diversity and multiculturalism. I'd like to pursue a Master's in Higher Ed and work in housing or some other part of student affairs a while and then perhaps eventually pursue a PhD. I think my dream would to some day run a Multicultural Center or a LGBT+ Center. 

Specifically I'm interested in working with gender and sexual minorities as well as with Native Americans. I'm studying out west at the University of Utah and while I'm not working in student affairs, I've been working closely for the past three years with the Shoshone People. One thing that I'd like to look into (and maybe I'm being too academic as I'm not sure how much Higher Ed master programs are research based) is the recruitment of Native students to schools in the East that don't have large native populations (as compared to the University of Utah whose mascot is named after the major tribe of Utah, the Utes). 

Any suggestions as to programs I should look at or people I should look into would be helpful. Also any advice from those who switched paths from something else into higher ed would be encouraging as well. It's been a long and tiresome road to decide what I want to do with my life and the more I think about it, the more I feel I belong down this path.

As for moving from another field into student affairs, I went straight from my undergrad into my masters program, but to be fair I was a Chemistry major in my undergrad. Quite a difference :3 I would say my advice is just to play to your strengths and remember that your other path has probably given you some wonderfully unique experience that can help you forge your own path in student affairs as well.

1c0cgv,"Student organization making money on school's campus using school's name, hiding profits from school. I don't think it's money laundering, but could the school sue us? (x-post from r/legaladvice)","I work for a campus organization that hosts events that bring in 100k+ each year.

That non-profit-- the board is made up of young alumni-- then buys us things that the school would otherwise regulate like plane tickets, vendor contracts, etc.
My concern is that we are making money using the school's name and the school's facilities and not declaring it in anyway. We are acting as agents of the university when we put on these conferences.

I'm a 2nd year SA/HE grad student at a small university in WV and am currently taking Governance as one of my classes.  Our main project for this class is (in groups) to create our own university.  This involves everything from naming and mission statement to budget and assessment.   I'm hoping that some people might not mind sharing some information about their schools with me so I can get a good idea of what other institutions do?

We also cover goals/strategic planning, org governance, student affairs division (support offered, services available, etc.).

I think most directors understand that it’s just not possible for all Hall Directors to become the Director of Housing due to the way executive positions tend to funnel up, so they like their employees to be well rounded and find departments around campus that also interest them.  That said, you will have to be very focused and intentional about seeking those opportunities, and in your interviews you’ll have to at least somewhat pretend you love the job you’re applying to while still talking about where you see yourself in 5 years (if it’s not the same department or area of campus).

fw58ev,How does your U handle keys / lockouts?,"I'm curious what other U's do!

**Context:** Private, 4yr, \~130 residential students in 4 buildings. 8 RA's, 2 FT Resident Directors live on site. It's also worth noting that our RDs are  hourly, so there is some gray area on asking them to be available for lockouts 24/7, by gray area I mean I'm not sure it's legal unless we pay them for all those hours :)

**Lockouts**: Right now, between RAs and RDs we generally handle students locked out or their room or building from 7am-midnight. Campus Safety has 24-hour staff so they handle 12am-7am. We have lockboxes in each building that house all the backup keys for each room, we have to access the RA office, get the proper key out of the lockbox and then return it. Neither RAs or RDs are allowed to have master or sub-master keys. 

I would prefer a world in which RDs have master keys (access all campus) and RA's have a sub-master for just their building. Then I'd like Campus Safety to issue all resident keys (so we don't have \~100+ keys in each of our lockboxes). This seems like it would be the normal practice but as it stands, Res Life (RDs) issue and attempt to keep track of all resident keys and their backups.

Who issues and charges for lost keys at your U?

Who handles lockouts? and during what times?

f660ie,Graduate Assistantship Interview Tips,"Hi folks! I recently got admitted to Pitt’s Higher Education Management MEd program, and I’m so excited! I fell in love with higher education when I got to my undergrad institution, and knew it was the career path I wanted to follow ever since I became involved with my university’s office of admissions.

In order to get a chance at receiving a fully-funded GA position, I have two days of interviews at Pitt’s campus. I’m nervous because there’s a lot on the line for me- I’m a first generation college student who doesn’t want to take out more loans. There are only a few GA positions available (full tuition remission + $16K stipend and benefits), and they are quintessential for me to get since I’m an out of state student.

What advice do you have? I want to eventually get my PhD in higher ed doing research on first gen students, and I want that to come across in my interview. I’ve already reached out to a lot of the faculty at Pitt, including my dean, advisor, enrollment manager, and program director to introduce myself. What questions should I ask? What experiences should I highlight? 

TL;DR: Recently admitted Pitt MEd student who is a few weeks away from GA interviews. There aren’t a lot of GA positions available, and I need one to afford this program, so what will make me a viable candidate that stands out during their interview?",studentaffairs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/f660ie/graduate_assistantship_interview_tips/,False,,3,"Congrats on your acceptance to Pitt’s program! That is exciting. Have they explained what specific assistantships are available? I know some programs will include position descriptions to applicants or at least make those available on websites, etc.

1.) If you have similar access to said position descriptions, start looking those up to a)  see what most interests you but also b) reflect how your previous experiences relate to what the positions require. Familiarity in functional units or certain skill sets goes a long way in this field.

2.) My next advice is to know your “why.” It sounds like you have a passion for the first generation student experience. Be prepared to articulate this in detail. Stories are even better! Why does that work matter? What can you offer to students who also identify as first-gen? What experiences do you have working with this student population? These are questions you’ll be expected to answer during interviews.

3.) Finally, it also sounds like there are a limited number of tuition waiving assistantships. This is worst case scenario, but let’s say you don’t get an offer for one of those. My advice? Honestly, I wouldn’t enroll. An MS / M Ed degree in student affairs / higher ed is not one worth taking out tuition-level loans for. Why? This field just doesn’t pay that well, especially for some (see also: numerous) entry level positions. Additionally, many, many programs offer assistantships that do cover tuition and other expenses. 

TLDR version: it’s not worth paying full tuition at one program when plenty of others do offer tuition-waiving assistantships.

d9nxed,Fear of getting stuck...," For background, I graduated with a BA in management from a small private college in MN in 2018. After graduation, I was hired as a Housing Director at a very small college. After this year, I will have two years of experience under my belt in residential life. Additionally— this year, I have an additional position in academic retention. I have been accepted to my top choice grad program for the fall of 2020. I know that I am qualified for a graduate assistantship in residential life, which would come with free housing. Because I know I will have very limited income as a grad student, free housing is a huge draw. BUT, if I have learned anything in my time as a Housing Director, it is that housing/res life is NOT my passion. I would love to never have to work in res life again. SO— my question is, with the two years of experience in res life, and an assistantship in the same area, would I be condemning myself to a career working in res life? How hard would it be for me to get out of res life if I were interested in moving into campus activities type work?

I say this for a few reasons. First, yes, you can do internships/practicum experiences elsewhere.  But these are short(er) term, often limited-in-scope experiences that won't give you full exposure to an area (or areas), and certainly not to the extent an assistantship will. Second, while breaking out is doable, I've seen a lot of typecasting on the hiring side and you'll have to work that much harder to overcome that and demonstrate how your skills are transferable to whatever area(s) you're actually interested in 2 years from now. Lastly, you'll enter your assistantship already thinking about how you can't wait to get out of it and move on to another area. Now, I'm sure you won't want this to color your experience, interactions, and attitudes, but it certainly could. It's like going to a restaurant you don't like when you're hungry - you'll eat the food because you need to eat, but you won't be happy about it.

I have a Higher Ed masters but my career is currently in K12/higher-ed edtech due to personal reasons + visa sponsorship issues.

What I've noticed when I reach out to higher ed professionals is an overall distrust in Edtech tools. This might be warranted due to the many tools that exist on the market or pushy salespeople who don't understand their users. 

For those who have purchased or partnered with external tools/platforms to support their work, I'd love to have your advice on what's most important to you when deciding whether to use/buy a tool and/or when recommending a tool to your students.

Its all relative. Best is to identify what you want to do, and navigate where you could best be supported. If you're in Indianapolis, I'm assuming either Butler, IUPUI, or University of Indy. Whichever campus you're on, a good idea would be to ask yourself ""Do I want to stay in this setting? Or do I want to experience something different"".

Vastly different, and it challenged me while opening my professional horizons so much.

I will be applying for SAHE programs this fall. I am 3 (going on 4) years out of my undergraduate degree, working in finance, and looking to make the career shift to align more with my passions/career goals.

They may not be using 'Comp time' correctly.

If you're traveling or dealing with peak visitors in August, September, and October, then it would be impossible to take off very much time in those date ranges and still be performing your job. That's about 16 weeks. If you're traveling into November, I can see that would be 20 weeks. There's no way around the fact that the job is seasonally based.

That's just how it is. I'm surprised, though, that it's a hard ""black out"" time period. We've all been able to take days off here and there assuming there was coverage or we weren't on the road. 

We get overtime in my office - even though it turns out we didn't have to implement the new overtime rules, we did. So those evenings working and weekends are all cash in the bank for us - or we get to adjust work hours that week around the evenings. Of course, I prefer the overtime because there's just too much to do and I like getting things done. Part of the job is having mad sprints and then times where things ""relax"" down a bit.

They brought extra staff and everything to interview me. Said they'd be in touch - loved that I visited campus. Never heard from them again. They decided to just do an internal search but never gave me the courtesy of a call or email.  ,2018-03-22 03:00:18

Has anyone ever had this issue and how to you make in roads and connect with people since you are confined to this one area?

Thanks!",studentaffairs,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/7sof0b/job_hunting_when_you_are_tied_to_one_area/,False,,3,"I sadly haven't been successful yet in my location locked search, but I will say: NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK. 

Just saying the word does nothing, of course, so I'll give you some of what I've done. I've told pretty much everyone I know I'm looking, even when just meeting them. Got 2 contacts in our small church through just telling people I'm looking (one used to work at a place in the area, another did an informational interview with me; I volunteered to help our historian, who taught this guy in school.) 

Volunteering sounds like an obvious (but good) way to fill time, and it could help. I found out during a training that the largest player in my area DID do temping applications, but didn't advertise them. Through that, I just finished a temporary assignment there. Multiple goodies even from a temp position: new references, new position on my resume, new people I've met (one is heavily involved in their SA program and is a provost of SA there so I've reached out to her to see if she could do coffee or something, after she told me to contact her to chat some time.) (Getting permission to bother is lovely!)

I wouldn't have gone to that particular volunteering location had I not been pointed there partially by someone in the area who said they'd be posting a job related to it. (Turns out I wasn't qualified for it anyhow, but oh well.) I met this particular person when I went all-in and attended the area conference for my chosen avenue (international students) and basically tracked down a bunch of folks that I found from the app (yay for pictures and details of where they work), explained my interest, and gave them my resume. The conference was not cheap, but I made contacts, and that does matter in the long run. 

The very last bit I'd recommend is seeing if there's any groups in the area. While at the temp job, I spotted a flyer with the guy I'd done the info interview with in the break room. Apparently, he was doing a panel for a local group called Young Professionals in Higher Education. SCORE! That panel is tomorrow morning, and I'm bringing resumes (as I've researched/stalked and found quite a few people will be there that I tangentially know or have heard of.) Even better? When I researched, I found that one of the board members of this group was a good friend of my brother's way back in high school. Ding! Another contact!

I'll note that most of these developments have been within the last six months or so. It's not easy to put yourself out there time and again (even if you are an extrovert, surprisingly), and rejection is like a stab in the stomach every time. But! Keep trying. If you truly believe this is your calling, you cannot give up. And you won't. Tell every single person you meet what you're interested in. Don't badger for a job but express your passion for the field. I'm hoping tomorrow's panel, the email to provost at the temp job, and sheer luck will bring me something soon. Good luck to you.

I have a little different situation that I haven't really seen anyone ask here. I graduated from a small college with a Nursing degree.

I then become an Assistant Residence Director while I worked on my Masters in Nurse Education. About 6 months into this position, I was offered a position as a Residence Director.

Since then, I have completed my masters degree, and still work as an RD. I enjoy what I do, and the people I work with, however have completely grown out of the ""Live-in"" scenario of an RD. I'm now looking into new positions that I can hopefully incorporate the last 6 years of my school life.

5txxy7,Grad school or gap year(s)? [long post],"Hi everyone. (this is going to be a long post and I sincerely apologize for this)

Last time I posted about needing some advice about potential grad school options [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/5in04c/possible_sa_grad_student_need_your_advice/), and some of the comments have been helpful.

So my decision, after talking to my parents and some professors/supervisors about it, was to go ahead with the offer from Rochester (for their Educational Administration w/ concentration in SA and Academic/Career Advising), but deferring my enrollment to January 2018 instead of the original August 2017.

Reasons for deferral:

* 1) I will be graduating in mid-May, and would be returning home sometime in early June (after getting all my things sorted with the lease and the phone/internet plans and all that. Rochester's program would have me attending orientation in mid-August. I plan to come to Rochester at least a week earlier to settle in & everything, so that would have me returning to the US in early August.

So that leaves me with less than two months to rest at home, and after four years of leaving my country to study in the US (& only going home for the summers), I don't think it would be enough. & my grandmothers would definitely be mad if I'm only home for a little while.

* 2) With what's going on after the inauguration and everything, my parents are a little worried about me staying in the US, so they want to see how things are going to be in the next couple of months and see if it gets better/worse.

* 3) Funding wise. Currently parents are supporting my brother on his master's in Scotland, and he would be finishing in Sept/October. Thought it would be better to let him finish first before they start worrying about funding my master's program (since I would at least be on personal funding for the first few months at least while I try to get an assistantship/job).

However, I am also currently looking at opportunities to work in Malaysia in the SA / Higher Ed sector that would accept my BBA degree without my Master's. I've asked a couple of people in the industry, and they said that it is not a requirement to actually have a Master's degree in SA/Higher Ed to work in the industry. But from some of the job positions posted online, I realize that once you want to go higher up the career path, the Master's would be useful/a requirement to have.

So I was thinking if I should just put a hold on my decision to go to graduate school, & work on getting some experiences first back home (OPT is not an option for me to stay in the US, as I am a BBA holder and I won't be able to work in SA, even if I can find one). I've already applied to multiple SA/Higher Ed jobs (in colleges back home, in private education consulting companies, etc), and have gotten some good replies (though most of them are recruiting for immediate positions, but they do ask me to get in touch with them again once I'm back home in June). I also applied for Teach for Malaysia (equivalent to Teach for America, a 2-year teaching/leadership program), which I'm highly likely to get an offer from considering how I volunteered with them two summers ago and that they fast-tracked my application to the final stage without going through the online assessment and everything.

What do you think? Would you recommend taking a few years off to work / find experiences, or to go straight to grad school? I've probably had about 2.5 years of experience in SA (in the Admissions Office), but other than that, nothing much related to Education/SA/Higher Ed specifically.

I'm trying to be overly cautious because I have too many mistakes in education and the working world weighing me down and I can't afford to make another one.

Thanks to my parent's assistance in allowing me to live with them rent free, I have the ability to take any two classes as a non-degree student at an undisclosed university in Virginia. 

I also have the ability to take any classes within the Academic Advising Grad. Certificate program at Kansas State. 

My plan as it stands is to take two in-person classes at the state school that are part of the M.S.in Higher Education (Student Affairs) program and to take one distance-learning class that is part of the Academic Advising Grad. Cert. program at K-State.

Cost wise, I'm looking at $2,877.00  for the two Virginia state school classes and $1,654.80 for the one K-State class... for a grand total of: $4,531.80.

In taking these classes, for the state school, I will have completed two classes that are part of the Student Affairs Administration track of the Higher Education master's degree... I will still have 33 credits (11 classes) to go to complete the degree... which, if tuition stays the same (it won't), will cost at least another $15,823.50.

For K-State, to complete the Grad. Cert. in Academic Advising, I am looking at at least four more classes, for a total of $6,619.20 (again, assuming tuition doesn't go up).

So, all in all, in order to pretty much guarantee that I can get an entry level academic advising job somewhere in the country, I'm looking to add another $22,442.70 onto what already amounts to over $150,000 of school debts (all of which I am currently unable to pay down on given my present salary and obligations--again, I have made many mistakes in higher ed up to this point...).

My question is, do you think taking on this new debt for this purpose is worth it? 

The biggest problems I am struggling with are the return on investment and the higher education job market. 

According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the median salary in the U.S. for an academic adviser is $43,546. For an event-planning assistant (pretty much what I am right now) the median salary in the U.S. is $36,356.

Consider this, however: I make exactly $28,652, which is only 78% of the national median. If, keeping things consistent, I made 78% of the national median for an academic advisor, I'd be looking at about $34,318 per year. So, for an ""investment"" of $22,442.70 one can say conservatively that I will only increase my salary by less than $6,000 a year (or $250 per pay check). 

Over a 10 year period I'd be looking at about $60,000 more in income; but, my monthly bill to finance that loan would be half of the increase in my salary--so, really it'd only be about $30,000 over a 10 year period (or about $250 extra dollars per month). 

All of this might be acceptable if I could guarantee job security and didn't have worries about the bottom falling out of the higher education market... my guess is we're in a bubble right now with Higher Ed. Admin. and there's nothing for it to do but burst. 

Is this a fair guess?

I just don't know how to predict what life would look like in a world where the niche that I am trying to specialize in goes away... What are your thoughts on this?

(One problem to consider is how versatile a Higher Ed. Admin. degree is (or, is not, in this case)--if I were studying, say, counseling, or something more general, I think I'd be less worried--note that counseling is off the table for me seeing as though a M.S. in Counseling is 61 credits at the state school I'm at).

Another issue I have is that I know the Higher Ed. Admin. courses are going to be easy for me. On the one hand that's a good thing because it means I'll be able to basically BS my way through a master's degree--hopefully maybe even to the point that I am a stand out student and achieve some recognition from the school and the program. But, and this is my greatest concern, I think that if the classes are a joke, it's a huge signal that the actual value of the degree is border-line worthless (except for allowing one to continue in the Higher Ed. world (bubble?) since it's pretty much a requirement to have that credential to obtain a full time job--at least in tough markets like Virginia--maybe not in places like Texas, however). 

What I mean is, I will not really be increasing my skills all that much with a degree in Higher Ed. That concerns me both because I know I can do more and because I know being able to do more is more valuable over time. 

But, what does it mean to do ""more""?

Given the trajectory of where our economy is heading (my guess is we're going to need to begin becoming more competitive in manufacturing if we're to ever increase the size of the middle class), I just wonder if it might be better for me to say no to this opportunity right now and work toward something more technical and more difficult--even if it's outside of my present field. 

So, yes, here is the crux of my struggle.

I have had success at studying more technical material than what one finds in student affairs. In particular, I know that if I were to apply myself, I could leverage my ability to work with computers (programming, working with data analysis tools, database management, mathematics, stats., etc.), and ultimately get a job with a starting salary much higher than anything in education. 

So, I guess I wonder if I might be better off diverting any money available for education into a program that builds the kind of skillset marketable enough to earn significantly more than I will as an academic advisor. Say, by studying computer science, engineering, statistics, etc. etc. . . . the chief concern not just being the mental satisfaction of being challenged but the economic incentive of being able to actually pay my bills.

Perhaps instead of signing up for two classes leading into Higher Ed. I could do one Higher Ed. class and one difficult class and prove that what I say is true--that, if I apply myself, I *can* succeed in something more technical. Perhaps that's a gamble worth taking just to ensure that I am not selling myself short...?

What do you guys think?

There's a lot more to all of this--like the fact that I do have 10 months of the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill available... the fact that I currently work in Higher Ed. and have more experience in Higher Ed. than any other industry (except for defense, which I don't wish to get back into), and other things like working conditions... flexibility... personalities with whom I work... etc. etc. All of which might be better in Higher Ed. than elsewhere.",studentaffairs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/4yjpql/need_to_make_a_decision_student_affairs_or_not/,False,,9,"Don't do the K-State advising certificate or masters.

And that was because the person had experience working on campus as a full time job while doing the K-State program. ",2016-08-19 23:59:32

3t2oo5,Student Activities Questions,"Hey everyone, 

I have a few questions and hope this is a good place to get soem responses.  If there is a better subreddit please point me in that direction.

1.
I work at a small private institution as the Director of Student Activities.  Recently I have noticed an increase in overall apathy from the student body.  With a limited budget I try to bring in events that they couldn't otherwise do in our location and support the common interests most students have ( we are on the beach so I bring in rock walls, zip lines, etc but also cater to surf culture with beach parties, luaus, and free water sport equipment rentals)

Surprisingly attendance is highest at dances in our dinning hall and bingo nights.  I was wondering if anyone had had extremely successful events that were unique to your institution and had students wanting to see it again year after year?

2.
I see a lot of posts on here from Check Im Here, does anyone use that system?  What do you utilize on it the most?  Are there other systems like orgsync or campus labs that you would recommend for tracking attendance, surveying, and promoting events?

3.
Our Service Learning opportunities have been less utilized this semester compared to the past three years.  I am trying to find a balance between addressing social issues in our community and the ""sexy"" appeal that draws students in.  Any suggestions on service opportunities that work well at your institution or tips on revitalizing the marketing of these opportunities?

Thanks for reading through my random thoughts/frustrations about the current semester and for any words of wisdom you all could share.

That said, I'm also a new professional, in a low-level position, at a podunk regional campus, so I could be an outlier. I know my old directors were pretty good about communicating with their counterparts at other schools. ",2015-07-10 04:33:26

33eavp,How much does going to a top grad school matter for a Student Affairs career?,"Hello All! 

I am currently working in marketing/communications in an admissions office for a mid-sized public university. I would like to transition to a more student-involved role over time. At the school I work for, I get a great education benefit. I could essentially get a Masters in Higher Ed Admin for a 90% discount. The one thing is, the degree program is fairly young and hasn't built much of a reputation for itself thus far. (It seems like a decent program, it's just that the Ed department is not a household name by any means.) 

My question is: if I am trying to kick-off a dynamic career in SA, will the reputation of the institution in which I earned my MA matter significantly? Are potential SA employers very prestige-conscious like they are in fields such as law/business? ",studentaffairs,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/33eavp/how_much_does_going_to_a_top_grad_school_matter/,False,,5,"I think the answer you receive will vary based on our past experiences.  Those who attended more ""prestigious"" programs might say it is important.  Those who did not might say otherwise.  

You can have a good experience anywhere.  If you think the faculty at your institution are invested and will mentor you into a great professional then you will be fine.  Do not underestimate the importance of the educational benefit. That will allow you a lot of freedom when job searching.    ",2015-04-22 04:46:30

I was recently seeking resume help and advice when a kind poster pointed me in the direction of this subreddit!  I'm glad to see Student Affairs has such a strong showing here!

As for me, I'm hoping to return to the Student Affairs field after taking a three-year break to work in the private sector.  As much as I'm sure I needed a break after living and working on campus for the better part of 10 years, I find myself missing interacting with students.

I have tried unsuccessfully to re-enter the field but I'm not giving up yet!

If you're applying for a job that requires you to be a role model, academically, such as an adviser, coordinator,  specialist or counselor, we look at transcripts to make sure you have decent grades. We had a candidate with 6 f's, many withdrawals and countless d's interviewing for a student support specialist position. He didn't get hired.
2. Make sure you know basic interviewing skills. We've had countless candidates who were chewing gum, not making eye contact, literally begging to be hired, or who made many other faux pas. This also means be prepared to answer 'what are your greatest/weakest skills' questions. I'd also add, be able to explain gaps in your resume. 
3. Research pay scales. Some state universities are required to show who is making what. Don't ever mention who in the office is making what, but know the range so that you can negotiate accordingly. If they say it's non  negotiable, vacation and other fringe benefits (non healthcare related) could be negotiable.
4. If your degree(s) is/are not related to the position exactly, play up what in your background is related. We had a candidate who had a master's from a fashion design school in Italy. She kept referring to her 'scholarly and academic coursework that would help her in the position.' Her master's specialization was in boot design. So we thought she didn't have a great grasp on reality.
5. The HR requirements that someone commented on this thread is extremely important. Great candidates sometimes slip by HR to the departments for interviews. But, after HR counts your years of experience and determines that it is 2.5 years and not 3 like the position calls for, they keep searching or interviewing.

I ask because you could start looking now, but many employers who are looking to fill positions current would either expect an quick start date, or later in the fall semester a start date in Jan. for the spring semester.

Also depending on what you are looking for in a job, some of the standard conferences would be a great way to apply to multiple positions at once.

We will ask for some things back, but will also let the students keep the outfits if it's all they have access to. We will also go shopping at Goodwill if donations aren't enough.

We were able to give her a slightly bigger stipend for the extra work, and she got valuable experience that landed her a great job out of undergrad. 

Of course not everything can be done by a student, so I (as the supervisor of the person on maternity leave) took on a bit more of the administrative stuff. I really didn't mind as much as I thought I would, especially because it gave me a chance to work closely with said student (I miss seeing them so much since I have moved ""up the ladder"").

When the workload got to be too much, we also divided up some smaller tasks among other colleagues (but it doesn't sound like that could help in your situation).

We also wrote a lot of transition reports for before, during, and after the maternity leave (me, the student, and the employee out on leave) so that everyone felt like they were on the same page and that the majority of students were not affected.

I was wondering if you might have anything that might be great to know/prepare for as I get ready to transition into residence life for the first time (including boundary setting/time management/etc related tips, I'm sure my wife and I could use them!)

Thanks!",studentaffairs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/1mv2sy/what_should_i_expect_as_a_first_timer_in/,False,,4,"Hi there, 

I would say the RD position work related tasks change based on the size of the instituion you're working for. For instance the Athletic Director at a DI school becomes business man, while at a DIII school he might be the one setting up transportation and managing recruitment numbers. 

So for a smaller school (like the one I work at) the RD might oversee housing, student conduct, area coordination, programing, advising, as well as daily administration tasks. 

Having lived with a reslife professional for 4 years and having worked in reslife for 2 now, I would say that it is very important to set boundaries for the main of the student body while living on campus. While you might be on campus 24/7 you do not work 24/7 (even though inessence you will on a smaller campus). 

General nightmares that result in improperly set boundries include students knocking on doors, students having cell numbers, student's attempting to arrange meeting during the weekend. 

Remember it is the RA's job to act as a liason for the student body to student life. Meaning they should be keeping things on the lowest level. If a resident has an issue they should be bringing it to an RA. If the RA feels it should be brought to you they will, or hopefully the RD who is on Duty. 


The smaller the school, the smaller the staff, the more often your hours become all-day. It's often an enjoyable job so perhaps the after hour club meetings, complex meetings, or event attendance will not be seen as work. But managing your time and your stress level will be important. 

As someone has mentioned, there are BUSY times during the year. Openings / Closings / Housing times are generally when you'll end up having to be in the office late. There is just often too much to do, so expecting and planning ahead can usually save hours and stress. 


There are many different styles in working and living on campus. Finding a balance between supervising, being able to remain unbaised in conduct, and creating community and being a part of that community is important.  ",2013-09-22 06:37:40

Most of my work is done in StarRez, though I have access to other tools. Here are a few examples of projects I started recently:

* Compared the GPAs of students on LLC floors vs non-LLC floors
* Sent targeted messaging to non-traditional aged students to encourage them to apply to our university apartments
* Compiled data on international students and students looking for gender neutral housing to improve messaging and support research

I might also be interested in looking at DFW rates in key courses (like those tied to the LLCs) and how those work with in folks in the LLC vs. folks on-campus vs. folks off campus. It would be helpful to further disaggregate by things like race, gender, first-generation status, financial need (we use Pell eligibility for an approximation), etc. That way you know if your LLCs are helping students, but you can also see if maybe some unconscious bias is going on and it’s not helping everyone equitably.

I understand that with social media and the opportunity to creep a little bit it's easy to go on the university's job site, see names of future coworkers, and then go to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to delve into their accounts for clues about their personalities. However, it's important to reflect on what you're looking for. A person's social media account isn't necessarily an accurate image of their personality and certainly shouldn't be considered a indication of how reliable they would be as a coworker.

The limits of my investigation into future coworkers is a university website to determine the structure of a department and the impression that they give in any interviews I might have. If you have particular questions about future colleagues, take advantage of the interview time to ask what you need to know about the professional and social interactions that take place among the group.

dahezj,Transitioning from Small School to Fairly Large,"I oversee Campus Activities. As a grad student, I worked at a small private school of around 4,000 people. Now, for the past year, I've worked at a state junior college with even less people, and only about 300 residential students. The place I'm at is not a good fit for me, in terms of both culture and setting. I'm looking to leave and want to apply to some larger schools (around 18,000 students).   
Despite my best effort and a lot of after-hours time spent working on programs and events (cleanup, setup, etc), most events just don't go well. I know in my brain a lot of that is because of our dwindling financial resources and because I'm literally a one-man show, and also the student culture (very few students want to even attend events, much less put forth any effort into providing programs). But I can't help chalking it up to some extent as a failure on my part. And the thought of leaping into a much larger pool terrifies me, as if I can't succeed at a small institution, I feel like I'll drown and just disappoint students at a larger school where there's so many more people to account for and keep up with.   
So I guess my question is, to those who have made similar transitions, how have you dealt with any fear related to it? Small schools are all I've known, and I'm terrified I'll be thrown into another one-man show situation at a bigger institution.",studentaffairs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/dahezj/transitioning_from_small_school_to_fairly_large/,False,,3,"Good question /u/Sneetchie1 I think that the movement between types and sizes of institutions is one that comes up a lot in the search for most professionals.

b028eg,Can I count my experience as related work experience?,"Hello r/studentaffairs community,
I am looking to break into the student affairs field, but I am hoping for some advice/guidance from some knowledgeable folks. I am applying for anything and everything at the colleges and universities in my area with the goal of working in academic advising, ideally.

I graduated with a BS in sociology with a minor in organizational leadership in summer 2017. Following my graduation, I worked unsuccessfully in several unrelated jobs for about 2 months each, and found that none of them fit me. 

A year ago I took a job working in hospitality so that I could move to the area where I wanted to live. If I'm being completely honest, I had no idea what I wanted to do in my career, and after working successfully in a field that does not fulfill me, I've realized student affairs is for me.

During my undergraduate career I was involved in orientation, Greek life, student conduct board, and leadership in several other capacities. I worked as a student assistant in the President's office and completed two internships. This is a very simplified summary of my involvement and undergraduate experience. 

Now for the actual questions:
1. Does my undergraduate experience count as the ""one or more years of related work experience"" that most of the jobs I've found require?
2. How can I frame my experience, relevant and irrelevant, as a selling point in applications and interviews?
3. Should I be applying for the academic advising/registrar jobs that I'm hoping for or start smaller?

Does my undergraduate experience count as the ""one or more years of related work experience"" that most of the jobs I've found require? 

Yes and no. It depends really on the position that you are applying for, the institution, and the functional area. If it does count, then it wouldn't be counted for the full rate (i.e. 1 year of UG experience wouldn't count as 1 full year of professional experience).

2. How can I frame my experience, relevant and irrelevant, as a selling point in applications and interviews? 

Exactly what coverletters are for. This is the place where you make the argument how your past experiences would be a good fit for the position you are applying for.

3. Should I be applying for the academic advising/registrar jobs that I'm hoping for or start smaller?

I would not shoot for this right now as you don't have experience in those functional areas. Though without knowing more, I would first recommend that you get a position at an institution and whatever roles best suits you and then apply as an internal candidate for the functional area you want to work in.

aowkui,Please advise: Student Observation and Concern,"Hi - I have a student that I advise/supervise in a student organization. I'm one of few people on campus in a professional setting that they interact within an advisor/mentor type relationship. Throughout the course of the school year, I've seen the student exhibit unhealthy food choices and moodiness. Recently, while traveling,  I noticed that the student started the car ride in a great mood. The five us shared in road trip karaoke and storytelling to entertain us during our travels. Along the way, the student asked to go to Wendy's, while the other students including myself went to a more healthier option. Not long after purchasing their food the student got into the car and was irritable and even looked different. They were the only person at their chosen restaurant. I've seen this happen prior to our meetings before, but have never been able to connect the dots between cause and effect. The student has spent some of our meeting times being sick in the restroom because of stomach trouble after eating fast food.  However, I have a hypothesis that the food choices she is making are negatively affecting her mood not too long after it is consumed. I also have observed that in due time they return to a less irritable state.  As a mentor and caring professional- should I approach this topic? I care about their health, but I also know that the student is in their second year, 19, without many people having the luxury of consistent and close observation.

&#x200B;

For additional context: this is my second year knowing the student and I spend about 3-4 hours a week with the student for various meetings.  Sorry if this sounds like a grad school case study.

I already have a hard time of working with little resources as it is and really could avoid the additional sass.  Thanks in advance for any insight.

I can certainly understand wanting to help out in this situation, but I'm in agreement with the other posters that I don't think this something that you should bring up with the student unless they choose to talk to you about it.

9ws3nk,MBA worth it in Higher Education? (Administration),"Hello,

I graduated with an undergrad degree in Business Management, worked for a major retailer as an operations manager for just over a year and then transitioned back to my Alma Mater as an Assistant Director of Operations for the Admissions department.

I am really loving my new position and could see myself working in Higher Education Administration for a long time. One of the benefits for working for the university is having access to a 70% tuition deferral, so I could essentially pursue a graduate degree for a fraction of what I spent on my undergrad degree.

My first thought is to go for an MBA as my undergrad degree already completes the first group of core classes, either in Business Analytics or Operations/Logistics, but I've heard that an MBA is only worth it from a top-school, which isn't a real possibility right now. Have you or anyone you've known seen an MBA be useful while working through the ladder in Higher Education? Are there other graduate programs that would be more beneficial for this field?

9tbcen,Rescinded job offer regrets,"Hi all,

In August, I ended up rescinding a job offer which I now think I should have accepted. Some background knowledge: I'm a relatively new professional and have been at my current institution for a year and a half. Our institution went through some restructuring, causing a lot of us to look at other positions (four of my coworkers left). I interviewed for a great job back in my hometown that would have afforded me more money, being near my family, and an opportunity to work at a larger institution. I struggled for weeks to decide whether or not I wanted to accept the offer, and after I did, I felt regretful because I'd grown attached to the people at my current job/friends I'd made here. I ended up rescinding the offer in favor of my personal development. Now, however, I feel a bit stunted and feel like I made a mistake professionally/personally. 

My question is, while I know they've filled the position I rescinded and it would be silly to come groveling back, I don't want to be blacklisted from that institution/department. I worked for them in grad school and had built a strong relationship with them, but now I fear I ruined that relationship by accepting then rescinding the offer. 

Is it too late to reach out to them to apologize and explain my mindset to them? How can I work on repairing that relationship in order to potentially have the opportunity to work there in the future? I understand that I have to stay the course at my current job because that's the choice I made, and I'll put my heart and soul into that. But have any of you ever worked at an institution to which you originally said no?

8qje8c,Question from an interview and my gender.,"Hi everyone!

Question for the group:

I had a great pre-phone interview a few days ago for an FSL opportunity.  The hiring manager asked a question that was a concern from the students that I would be potentially working with and I would like to run it by you all for advice/help/views.  The female students are wanted to have a female in the position after the previous three professionals were male.  The hiring manager asked how I would address this need from the women in the community.  I responded by affirming the need for representation in a professional setting, as a male identifying individual am enthusiastic about their organizations and the awesome work they are doing and how they are leading the fraternal community.  That communicating my passion and ability to serve their organizations would be crucial and it would start with establishing a strong relationship with the leaders of each organization and the leadership of the community.  

Would you all have any thoughts, ideas, concerns about my answer or better ways to address this situation?",studentaffairs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/8qje8c/question_from_an_interview_and_my_gender/,False,,1,"As a male identified individual in a role that solely advises panhellenic organizations, I've experienced that. It is a very legitimate concern that the students have. It comes down to having someone they can look up to, while identify with. 

I think you answered it to the best that it can. Additionally, I think its some of the best professional experiences being able to work effectively with students that don't share a dominant identity of yours. 

Moving forward, it would be good to basically clear the air in the beginning (if you do get offered the job). Acknowledging that you are not a woman, and have not been through their experiences, but that does not mean that you cant support them and fight for their experiences while developing meaningful/professional relationships with them. Citing development theories (josselsons) in practice, national trends, and acknowledgement of things such as effortless perfection and more will prove to them that you do know what youre talking about, while providing them a space to explore more of what it means to develop their identities as a woman.

8byfbv,Wrong date to file for request,"Hello people of this sub,

I wanted to ask if anybody has experience with near academic dropout.

I try to make this comprehensible and short as possible

I am almost at the end of my studies (bachelor thesis already graded, practical workload of internships etc. finished, all exams but 3 done)

Due to my depression I had to put my studies on slow, and until now I have worked off this mountain of exams; until my remaining 3 plus 1 more (results pending but it went well) 

We have a credit system which requires you to pass exams worth 30 credits each semester, to stay immatriculated. I had only left 3 exams for this semester (wintersemester) of each 9 credits and 4 courses in the summer semester with the remaining credits before i finish.

I did well on my last exams and even pulled up another course from the summer, so i could maybe get over the 30, but i dont know how i did on that one.

I have medical documentation that i can submit together with a written statement why i would like to continue studying, despite not hitting the 30, but I wrote down the wrong date for the submission; the professors of my field have convient 2 days ago.

I will still file my papers, with an additional note, that I made the mistake with the date, but I know they can reject me.

Has anybody got experience with a case like this? 

I am ok if I will be expelled. It would just suck, because I worked my way out of depression and now this.

Colleges want their students to succeed and to do so in an appropriate amount of time (because data is good when students do). With that said, I don’t know for sure you can continue forward without meeting the requirements of the program you’re in, but I would say it’s worth moving through the motions to try.

8bqbku,HELP! I took the wrong job!,"This may seem like the epitome of first\-world problems, but I took a job \(mid\-level\) at a large, private institution about 6 months ago and I am really struggling to adjust. It's not so much my core job function, I feel very comfortable with my tasks, but I'm really struggling to find my place, both at the institution and in my office.  Here are the key pieces:

1\) Part of why I struggle is that my institution has a very unique structure, one that I don't feel I fully gathered, either from the interview or my own research, and navigating that has cause me to have to very real questions about my value and place.  Essentially, I feel my position is not designed to be successful. I am not the only one who feels this way, but I don't think other have a real frame of reference.

2\) My office culture is strained to say the least. My supervisor had a very disjointed method of on\-boarding me, and it occurred because if preexisting rifts in our office. I've tried to come in and take initiative to overcome this, but because of my previous point, this is very difficult.

3\) I am an introvert, but my function is one where this is common. I've worked very hard to get to a good place to be successful in my role, but the above mentioned struggles have been super taxing. This to the point where I've been having panic attacks \(which I haven't had in roughly 10 years\).  I've sought counseling through a confidential service my institution provides. 

4\) My commute sucks. I could move, but not enough to make a substantial difference. 

So I'm looking for advice. How to I plot a way out?  I'm in a position where I've saved some funds, and could leave without a new job, but at the opposite end part of me says to suck it up.  I need some fresh opinions.

6aaunb,I'm experiencing a lot of harassment on my campus lately from political canvassers looking for donations,"I'm getting really frustrated with this and don't know if there's even anything I can do, or who on campus I would contact about this. Lately it seems like I can barely walk from one class to another without a canvasser interrupting me and demanding my time.

Today one of the canvassers almost pushed me to my breaking point by making a rude comment when I politely said I didn't have time and tried to walk past them, meant to make me feel guilty for not giving them a donation. I basically depleted my life savings to go back to school and am so broke, I can barely afford to buy food and pay my utilities right now. I was so ashamed, I went to the library and cried and have been in a bad mood all day.

61kv4c,International Scholarships,"Good day.

I'm looking for any advice on this topic.
I'm a South African, currently living in Cambodia (teaching English).  I have a Bcom Human Resource Management degree that is internationally recognized.  I have been accepted to do my Masters in South Africa - which is an option for me.  BUT I would love to study abroad.  I have done some research on Taiwan and China(my sister and friends of mine are studying there) but I am open to any other country across the world - preferably a first world country.  

Another factor is that I'm in Cambodia with my girlfriend (she is also from South Africa and also teaching English).  She does not have a degree but is interested in obtaining one - she qualified for a Bsc degree in SA but the country is unstable and there are protests and Universities are a hazard - it's hectic!

We are both Bilingual (English and Afrikaans).  We easily adapt to new surroundings and we are looking to start/continue our studies early 2018.  We are looking for a scholarship and would love to be at the same university or the same area.

Suggestions are welcome.

I currently go to a community college and have taken 4-5 online classes instead of the traditional classes, in part because online classes fit my schedule better and I can do all my work from home. Once I transfer to a 4 year college, do you think the fact that I have taken so many online classes will have any impact on my acceptance? Do other colleges look down on online classes? Or are online classes held to the same standard as traditional classes? I feel like online classes are considered easier...

As long as the classes are at a reputable institution, you should be fine. For transferring, colleges want someone with a strong gpa as that is the best indicator of academic success, and therefore the likelihood you'll graduate. Extra curricular help, but it's all about how you can share your story. 

As for easier vs harder, that depends squarely on you, the class itself, and the professor. Online classes should receive the same amount of time as a physical class of the same credit hours even though there is no physical meeting. If you can manage a 3.0+, and you are realistic as to where you want to earn your degree, you should do well with dedication.  ",2017-03-13 11:35:18

4z32nn,Graduating my HESA program early & the job market,"Hi all. I'm trying to decide whether to graduate early from my Higher Education/Student Affairs masters program. I have 3 classes left and work full-time in the field. I could either cram all 3 classes into the fall semester and graduate early, or I could save one class for the spring semester and graduate in May. I'm wondering if it could be advantageous in the job market to graduate off-cycle (in December, when there are theoretically fewer new grads looking for work). 

I am currently working in the subfield of student affairs that I want to stay in, but I want to move to another institution. I'm in a pretty competitive region and an area of the field that it seems like lots of people want to work in. The last time my department had an open position, we had over 200 applicants and only interviewed 4 of them. So, basically I'm worried about my chances of even getting an interview if I look for another position.

Am I wrong in thinking I might have a better chance in the job market if I graduate early? Enough so to make it worth going through a brutal semester? Compared to what my colleagues say about the HESA programs they graduated from, mine seems a lot more rigorous, but I think I could handle the extra-heavy workload for one semester.

Each school will require their own set of documentation and will render their own finding regarding eligibility for services. In my experience, documentation that would be accepted has not been eligibility records from another school, mainly because of law (eligible records are primarily defined by the gov't) and ADA requires that all documentation comes from qualified professionals in the appropriate field (your school's ODS staff are not the ones conducting the evaluations, just reviewing the information provided).

If another school accepts the documentation, I imagine it would be alongside with their requested documentation and would be used to inform services rendered, not used to determine services eligibility.

The charges are very serious and i am in the process of dealing with the felonies the university police have given me. I was academically dismissed instead of being expelled because i made a good impression at my conduct meeting with the school.

Since this has happened i have enrolled in summer school at my local community college. I have applied to transfer to some other schools and am waiting to hear back. I'm wondering what i should do from here. My motivation in my summer classes are non-existent and i don't know what to do anymore. Do you guys think i still have a shot at getting my degree at a four year school still? if so how should i go about doing this. Please help Reddit. Thank",studentaffairs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/4jusdd/questions_regarding_admissions/,False,,2,"I work in admissions and have for a few years at 2 different public university systems in my state.

This may all be a moot point, but in case you do not get admitted:

Different schools have different rules, but a typically common one I see is:
If you are academically dismissed and in bad standing at a school, you are not able to be admitted back at that school or that system, but you could try another system. The reason for that is that they need to see that you are a motivated student. So you can take a bunch of community college classes, but you are a student with a high risk of not graduating, based on your record, and they need to know you can handle their rigor, not the rigor of a community college (not to imply community college is not rigorous, as it is a great system with many many many benefits). 

If you really want to attend the same school or a school within the same system, you will need to take classes at an extension or over the summer(which is usually when students who are not degree-seeking can take classes, which basically means anyone in the general public) at the school you were dismissed from. Typically that's the case but some schools are more lenient and you just need to repeat them at another school in the same system. Little by little you can improve your GPA, if that is what you need to do to improve the ""bad standing"" status you have. Note that extension classes aren't covered by financial aid.

This is where I am a bit confused, as at most schools, getting expelled for behavior is not translatable to getting dismissed for academics. One is due to a behavior issue, one is due to academics. The above advice is if you have poor grades that are holding you back. As for behavior issues, you will need to talk to the school. You'd be surprised at how many colleges don't care about your reasons for leaving a previous school as long as the issue is not your grades (so either you had fine grades when you left or you've improved them since). If they don't ask it on the application (and I genuinely haven't seen it on any I've reviewed), then don't worry too much.

If you're willing to leave your school system and attend a different one, the rules are typically more lax and they care more about your overall GPA than the GPA from that one particular school. That's where community college will be very helpful. Take courses that you need to transfer plus major prep courses. Meet with a counselor every single quarter/semester. Be honest with them so they can have the whole picture. I promise you that community college counselors have seen far worse issues. 

If you have any more specific questions, you can feel free to ask more questions and I'll try to follow up.

3ts5ii,Which grad school option is better?,"Below are the details of my dilemma over whether to continue in an expensive but well-regarded HESA program or switch to a less well known program which would be free after 6 months at my new job. I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks!

I am currently in the first semester of a two-year masters program in Higher Education and Student Affairs at school A. I have a paid graduate assistant position with tuition remission at school A. However, I just accepted a job offer for a full-time position at another college, school B. This position will start next semester. School B also has a HESA masters program and they offer full tuition remission after 6 months of employment. I believe I'd be able to transfer my credits from school A to school B, but need to verify that. School A seems to have a better program in terms of resources, research opportunities, range of courses available, and networking.

School A is a large private research university. It is definitely more well-known, more highly ranked, and much more ""prestigious"" than school B. School A is much more convenient to my house (15 min. commute vs. 1 hour commute), and I would be happy to work there at a later point in my career. School B is a smaller, private comprehensive university and my impression is that it is not well-known outside this region. Now that I won't be a graduate assistant at school A anymore, I would have to pay full tuition if I continue in the program at school A.

My question is whether I should continue with my masters at school A now that I'll have to pay the full (expensive) tuition. How much does prestige matter in our field? 

I should mention that thanks to my partner's generous salary it would not be a financial hardship to pay for 1 class per semester at school A, but of course I don't want to unnecessarily spend the money if continuing to attend school A won't make much of a difference in my future career opportunities. 

Thanks for any input!

Edited to add another detail: A couple HESA students I spoke to at school B said the program is quite disorganized and overall they did not seem very pleased with it. The program is a lot smaller than school A's program, FWIW.",studentaffairs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/3ts5ii/which_grad_school_option_is_better/,False,,4,I'd say Salary + Free tuition vs. Salary + Exorbitant tuition is pretty much a no-brainer. ,2015-11-22 13:11:54

28yvvf,"Access & ""Real Talk"" about college cost","I was watching a thread on Twitter yesterday from @istudentaffairs talking about how we need to be more realistic about talking incoming students and the overall cost of college. 

I'm torn. Part of me acknowledges that the amount of debt that you can leave with does not always reflect the amount of money you are going to make (I graduated with a BA in English and MA in Higher Ed/Student Affairs, which does not translate into how much I spent to get my degrees). I also recognize that without the loans I have accrued, I would not have been able to attend college. 

So, my question to you all of you lovely Reddit friends. How do you balance these two forces? Access to college being harder and harder with rising costs, but also have ""real talk"" about long-term implications of tuition costs and going into fields that may not yield a salary you can really live on, while paying off loans. 

Thoughts? Experiences? ",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/28yvvf/access_real_talk_about_college_cost/,False,,1,"EDIT: Sorry for the wall of text.

I think some of this ""real talk"" needs to happen in a couple of places- first among colleges and universities and second between universities and students & families. 

Part of what has driven all of this is USNWR ratings. More and more colleges have been affected by mission creep with many schools aiming to becoming larger research universities in part because of the favor they receive in college rankings and public perception. Of course, we don't need so many research universities, and becoming one comes at a high cost which is passed off in some form to students. 

The other conversation that needs to be had is with parents in families. In addition to discussing how the USNWR ratings aren't all that indicative of quality or student success, but rather institutional wealth, the success of the incoming class while they were in high school, we need to discuss services and amenities. In a lot of ways we are caught in an arms race- each school is trying to offer new cutting edge facilities, more financial aid, and more to students. While many of these things are fantastic, it's become a part of the increasing expenditures required for the university to continue functioning and attracting classes and applications. We may need to have conversations within our communities and with families about whether or not it's truly realistic to expect significant number of singles to be available, or having private restrooms for students, do we really need to constantly add new ""free"" perks that end up being rolled into tuition dollars in some form? 

That's my thought on the access piece. I think there's a lot of things the US as a whole may need to examine in its culture to find ways to make higher ed more affordable and cut costs. 

As for real talk about cost, we do need to let students make their decision. A lot of this should be conversations they have with their families and what it means to take on so much debt. That being said, over 75% as of a year or two ago were borrowing under 25k which may not be that unreasonable for many (though 300+ in payments may seem significant if they aren't able to find a job- especially without the 6 month interest free grace period available anymore so that's certainly an opportunity for conversation as well). 

Something like only 4% of students take six figure loans- so when we come across those students headed towards that path I think talking to them about their plans (if they bring it up to you first!) is absolutely fine. I think being a bit realistic without crushing dreams is a worthwhile conversation to have- particularly when it comes to payments and how the student may be planning to pay them back. I know some that are in nonprofit work and plan to stay there and have them forgiven but are also fully aware of the large tax bill that may come with that. Others planned with their parents to live at home for a few years, and the list goes on. In an ideal world we will find ways to lower costs and states and the feds will increase public funding options available for higher education to bring the level back where it once was, until then we can really only do what it's our jobs to do- support the students and be available for them in whatever way is most appropriate.

I am saying this as a new professional and former student activist at a public 4 year institution, so my view on things may be skewed by those experiences.  ",2014-06-24 22:45:28

How do you do so individually?

a) their institutions are doing nothing to manage student expectations and staff members don't want to bite the hand that feeds them

or

b) they honestly have no idea of how the institution is managing expectations

I'll start with a small example. Our Student Service Center staff answers emails for Financial Aid, Billing, Veteran's Affairs, and the Student Service Center. We find that when we have our emails responded to in a timely fashion, our call volume is reduced. Now, our definition of ""a timely fashion"" is 48 business hours whereas our students...don't always feel this way. When I receive a phone call from someone who has just emailed us a few hours previously, I always explain our policy and that if they call and email close together, they've just increased the time it takes to respond to another student by being impatient. This is usually pretty effective at handling their expectations and making sure they don't do it a second time.

I think the biggest thing is being nice but firm in explaining that the institution is doing its best to serve all of our students, not just one student, and that our greatest allies in giving good customer service are often the students themselves.  ",2014-05-28 20:54:16

22l371,Universities with bad reputations for Student Affairs Professional career development?,"Hi all,

This is a rather general and perhaps weird question. 

I am a student at a university that is highly ranked (think top 10 in the US News rankings) for undergraduate studies.

Students here have a long, historically fraught relationship with the Student Affairs Professionals that run the student-facing parts of the administration. 

Talking to friends at other universities, things just seem *so unusually bad* here relative to other similar universities. The vast majority of our administrators seem to actively detest our students. The few good people who are hired to our division of student affairs mysteriously seem to rage quit after six months at most (sometimes in a matter of weeks!). There is just a deep, persistent lack of mutual understanding and engagement between students and the student affairs professionals. As someone who has tried to get involved and participate in student opportunities to be involved in university governance (committees etc.), the expectations on students by administrators (but not by faculty!) are baffling and very contrary to the university's overall academic culture. For example, being honest and forthright while still polite in discussing issues upon which two people disagree (one being in power and the other being a student) is seen as being insubordinate and rude. Basically, it's like a repeated clash of cultures that never seems to heal. Going back years in the student newspaper, and speaking with alumni, confirms that this is not a new problem. Further, we have persistent problems with the *actual administrative* side of our student affairs division. Systems are broken, important emails go unanswered by relevant administrators such that student groups cannot meet deadlines, residential buildings have actually been condemned due to neglect in performing maintenance, etc.

Someone who used to work here in student affairs (but ended up transferring to a completely unrelated department) mentioned to me that our university has a really bad reputation as a place to work for Student Affairs Professionals, and thus we tend to get the bottom of the barrel. Basically, we have a problem attracting and maintaining talent. She argued that this was a huge part of the reason for our persistent problems. This caught me totally by surprise.

Is it true that some top universities are not considered 'top' in terms of career development for a student affairs person? Asking the question, it seems totally obvious now that the answer is probably 'yes' - you guys have career development concerns and are going to select places to work like any other human beings seeking employment. Is it possible for a top school to have a persistent problem attracting top administrative talent?

",studentaffairs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/22l371/universities_with_bad_reputations_for_student/,False,,3,"I remember being told something by a colleague who worked at an American university that's always on those ""Top 10 Universities Worldwide"" lists:  ""The attitude here is, so what if these students don't make it, and they leave?  There's always a whole lot more in line to take their place.""

I've worked at a couple of only-slightly-less-stellar universities that didn't have that mindset.  I also had a memorable interview once at a very definitely third-tier state college where it was obvious after just a few hours on the campus that there was a massive amount of dysfunction and animosity between student leaders and the student affairs staff.  So I don't think it's a problem unique to top-tier institutions, or consistently found at all of them--but I think maybe some of that ""We're so lofty and awesome, we don't have to care"" attitude you find at some very prestigious schools does lead to those sorts of problems.

I just found this subreddit, and I am grateful that I was able to find like-minded people who are interested in discussing issues that are part of Student Affairs. I am extremely interested in getting into the realm of Student Affairs in Higher Education in the future, and I am hoping that some of you could lend a hand to help me achieve my endeavors.

A bit about me: I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Political Science. I decided that I wanted to continue studying Political Science and ultimately teach as a professor, so I decided to enroll in graduate school after a year off. I moved to my new school with all my belongings, but I came to the realization that Political Science was not for me during the second week of class, so I decided to drop out of the program. I came to the realization that I was truly interested in Student Affairs at a community college, and in a way, I always felt this way since my time as a student leader at my community college. I observed what my former advisor worked on and his responsibilities and the more that I thought about it, the more I wanted to be part of the field. In the future, I hope to be a Director of Student Affairs.

Basically, I am unsure of what I should do right now. In a way, I felt like I wasted my time and energy moving to a new school for my graduate program, only to withdraw from the university because I was no longer interested in pursuing a Master's degree in Political Science. At this moment, I am applying to community college jobs, specifically as a Transfer Specialist to help students with the transferring process. 

My question to all of you is: Is this the right path to take?

The way to avoid doing this is to ask genuine questions (if you can't think of any, then you shouldn't be taking up their time in the first place), keep your tone as absolutely professional as possible, and - I can't stress this enough - keep interactions BRIEF, TO THE POINT, and ON THEIR SCHEDULE.  If you come off pushy, you're going to get a rep.  Limit these cold calls at all costs: again, you don't want to get Captain E-O-N-G-N-A-J rep.

I've been tasked with putting together a training on the stages of team development in an interactive way. I am not quite sure where to start, and was hoping to get some suggestions.

I have 45 minutes to fill, and so far all I have to start is giving students 5-10 minutes to reflect and then share on teams they've been a part of and think about how they started, performed, and eventually ended. 

The goal is to stay discussion/interactive based with absolutely 0 lecture.

I have been gaining experience since 2015 (1 year Graduate Assistant, 3 years Residence Life, now in TRiO programs - Educational Talent Search) and have a Master of Science in Counseling - Clinical Mental Health. I have always had the goal of working in Student Affairs/higher ed and a long-term goal of teaching the subject of Higher Education/Student Affairs. While I really enjoy the work that I am currently doing, I am not in the student affairs sector, which worries me about staying abreast with current higher ed and student affairs lingo.

I think that I want to pursue a doctorate at some point but I also am afraid that if I do so now (with not a ton of experience) then I may over-qualify myself from other roles in the future. That's why I am considering EdS as kind of a mid-point degree that will give me more education that is higher ed specific. But, if I do this, then I will be in line to pursue my EdD and not a Ph.D. program. I see more people who are teaching with a Ph.D. and feel like that will set me up better to teach.

All that to say, I'm not really sure what to do. Will getting my EdD instead of Ph.D. affect my ability to become a faculty member in the future? Is getting an EdS a waste of time I could spend on doing a doctorate? Is it worth it?

e8x41t,Advising a Student to Pursue Student Affairs,"Okay r/studentaffairs, outsourcing for a situation that I'm a little too close to. A former student that I know spent their undergraduate career working in housing, student conduct, and volunteering in other offices around their big state school, and then graduated and worked in housing for a year (live-in role similar to a hall director, but with fewer responsibilities - I don't think they had full-time status, but I'm not certain) with plans to apply to graduate school in the field that they graduated in. They recently had coffee with me and shared that they really like working in the college environment, really liked the work that they did in student affairs, and can't really decide what to do next.

I think that the student would be a perfect fit for student affairs, but they're really set on pursuing a PhD in a science field and teaching. They think that they could get involved in student affairs from the academic side, I think because their alma mater encouraged faculty to hold additional responsibilities around campus (ie; the LGBT organization on campus, cultural/religious centers, themed housing communities, are all directed by overworked faculty, with help from student workers, graduate assistants, volunteers, or occasionally one or two part-time staff). I get the impression that this isn't really the case everywhere else, and faculty are more removed from student affairs - can anyone share attitudes about this at their universities? General locations would be welcomed, or if anyone wants to message me with more specifics.

I want to make suggestions for other careers in student affairs that this person could pursue, but I'm drawing blanks. They don't like their role in housing, they don't want to continue in student conduct, and the other offices that they've encountered seem a bit too specific. But they're starting to lose interest in pursuing a PhD now, and I don't want them to be a statistic of PhD drop-outs. I feel like I may be too close to the situation to advise well.",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/e8x41t/advising_a_student_to_pursue_student_affairs/,False,,6,"Is your advisee aware of the dismal success rate of PhDs in the sciences getting a job? Is your advisee aware of the lack of tenure track jobs? 

Maybe the job market is why they are reconsidering the PhD—and that is a VERY valid concern! I think we all know far more unemployed PhDs than tenure track PhDs.

What motivates your advisee? If it is money, freeway flying from adjunct job to adjunct job, and sleeping in their car because they are homeless—isn’t likely what they want to do with their life!

Would a money oriented advisee be willing to settle for a career in student services, when the field rarely even pays a livable wage? I guess you could try to lure them in with a Rez Life job, because at least with that they get housing + a meal plan.

But the typical advisee wants a career where they can afford to pay rent—considering the median national rent is a little over 50% of the median Masters level student services worker wage—where are they going to live?

We all know adjuncts and staff who sleep in their cars/ derelict RVs because they can’t afford housing. 

At one time this was limited to custodians and grounds maintenance.  Then the security guards began getting priced out. Today, it is the masters level student services worker who juggles three jobs while working gig economy during any free time—then it is a quick drive back to the “faculty parking lot” usually a private lot located close to the school—followed by a quick shower in the morning at the gym. I wonder why they wouldn’t want this life?

Do you want to know the real reason that campus security guards have such a high turnover? Many are homeless and lose their guard card after too many police encounters—the result of rough sleeping/ outdoor restroom use.

Don’t ever advise anyone to take this vow of poverty if they aren’t fully aware that the pay only gets better for a select few (director/ dean level) and these jobs go to those with the most connections/ privilege. ",2019-12-11 05:33:09

d9u024,How to address the passive aggressive advisor in the room?,"Long story short: advisor is passive aggressive and it makes working as a team rough. Do I mention it to my supervisor or hr?

I’m an academic advisor for an online and military program. I am one of three advisors (supposed to be four but I’m filling the empty position as well till we file it), we report to a manager who reports to the associate provost of AA.
Two (and the empty position) are location at military bases while one advisor and the uppers are on main campus.
We deal with a lot of class cancellations due to low enrollment. So two weeks before class we call students in classes of one or two to move them to classes with three and four if possible, as long as it works with their degree program.
The manager asks that we communicate and work as a team to tackle all of this so we use google docs since it’s live.

One of the advisors started sending passive aggressive messages after I tried to communicate and help saying advisors have incorrectly advised his students in the past or didn’t tell him that they were advising the students. Out of the four of us, while we have mentioned it, we haven’t made a big deal bc we’re here to help and we can all do our jobs.
I helped one of his students who reached out to me. It wasn’t u til afterwards that I found out it was his student. So I let him know, forwarded what I sent the student and his facial expressions were very clear that he was upset about me helping the student.

Today (after all of this) I found out he’s been incorrectly advising my students and never once mentioned anything to me.

People make mistakes, but I’m tired of the passive aggressive “reply all” emails whether it’s towards me or not. It’s unprofessional and unnecessary.

A part of me just wants to mention to my supervisor that I don’t appreciate the emails and it’s rather hard to work as a TEAM with someone with that attitude just for the record. A part of me just wants to leave it alone.

Also it’s worth mentioning that I’m the only one that actually cares to better myself and do well with my job bc this is my field whereas the other two advisors are “stuck” and don’t care (they didn’t want to do evaluations and get feedback unless it was attached to raises).

There's about 2,000 people in there all with the same story). In what you described above, it sounds like you're enjoying your counseling classes more. Once you're working, I'd recommend that you continue to check in with yourself and ask ""do I like student affairs more, or counseling more?"" With time, I think you'll be able to answer your own question. Also, I'm not necessarily saying that you're going to start to not like student affairs once you're working. You may love it! But I also wouldn't rush this decision.

av8kes,Supervising students vs. Grads vs. Entry level Pros in Student Affairs,"What are your thoughts? For me- 

Students are normally volunteer and trying to get Leadership experience to build their resume for the future. Task oriented. Do.

Grads - Want to go into field. More of a learning experience. They want to know more of the whys and should be educated on the processes and how what they are learning in the classroom applies to the work they are doing in their assistantship.

Entry level pros - Mostly in it for the long haul. Looking for experience to get them to the next step. Make sure they have their job/responsibilities down before allowing them to get that extra experience.  Learning their vision for their role and professional development to help them find methods to take them one step closer to their goals

Posting twice in one day after being a long time lurker is weird, but I figured I’d try to ask for advice! 

I’ve completed two years of college, ( I plan on graduating with my associates in generals this December and want to transfer to a BA/BS program )  and I’ve been able to successfully pay for the whole experience with my own money, scholarships and FAFSA. 

Now, however, I’m realizing that there is next to no way to being able to pay for the university that I want to attend without taking out a good chunk of loans. I’ve let the idea of student loans scare me for such a long time, but I know that in order to go further into what I want, I need to get into a good school and take out loans. 

My request for advice is this:

-where do I start? I literally have no idea how student loans work.

-how do I take out loans? Do I need good credit? 

-do student loans only pay for school or will they help pay for housing? ( dorms, apartments, textbook, etc ) 

-do the student loans go directly to the school or me ooorrrrrrrr

You also could try r/college if you want advice from other students. This subreddit is for student affairs professionals. 

&#x200B;

From what I recall about the process, you start by applying to schools. Before you apply, you should play around with each school's college cost calculator ([here's an example](https://accounting.vcu.edu/tuition/calculator/)) to see  how much you could be expected to pay. Alongside your application, probably want to fill out the FAFSA and possibly also the CSS Profile if requested by your school; these provide information about your current financial situation to determine your eligibility for financial aid (including federal loans and work study).

If the aid you receive from your school and the government doesn't cover the total cost of attending the school you choose, loans are an option you can take. Your credit score does determine, in part, if you can get a loan, how much you can borrow, and the interest rate you'll be offered, but student loans are often given to people with little-to-no financial history (in these cases, a cosigner may be needed).

In my situation, my student loans went directly to my school; I lived on campus so I don't know about using loans to cover rent. I think private loans can be more flexible, but I would caution against spending student loan money on non-college expenses as you implied. ",2019-01-14 04:19:59

8zm1z6,What are my chances of getting an assistantship?,"Hey everyone, I recently decided to take the student affairs track with 1 year left in undergrad. It’s my mission in life to help students that were like me when I started college. I’m worried that I won’t get an assistantship, and end up lost not knowing what to do after.

I have lots of residence life experience, such as being a hall council exec member, desk assistant, Resident Assistant, Residence Hall Association exec board(attended housing conferences), National Residence Hall honorary president. I did summer orientation two years in a row as well as first week orientation two years in a row. I have undergrad research experience in special education(my former field), and I’m also participating in a unique internship this coming year that involves training service dogs on campus.

For whatever it’s worth, I’m hearing impaired and can reflect on my experiences being differently abled(and helping students who are the same way, as I planned to be a speech pathologist)

Can I just get your thoughts on my experience? It’s so difficult for me to find info and to measure my chances. I like to plan ahead and feel as secure as I can.

When you're looking at programs, look to see if a GA is required as part of the admissions process.  You can also ask about placement rates if it is not required, as that can tell you how likely it is that you would find something.  My hunch is that if you want residence life, you're also more likely to find something, too; from my experience, this is where the bulk of the assistantships are in any given program.

TL;DR: Pretty good chance of landing an assistantship, and that chance probably goes up the more programs you apply to.  

Oh, and an unsolicited but relevant piece of advice - don't go to a program that doesn't offer you an assistantship.  Your in-class work is important, but your experiential work is equally so... and the only reliable way to get that is with an assistantship. ",2018-07-17 23:24:11

8pfhgo,Career in Student Affairs (Doctoral Level),"Since I was an undergraduate I knew that I always wanted to earn my degree in student affairs and I am delighted that I will be taking my talents back to my alma mater to earn my M.Ed in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in College Student Personnel Administration. With it, I want to be able to work primarily in College Access & Equity programs for middle and high school students. For example: TRiO programs, Higher Education Opportunity programs, outreach programs for middle and high school students, and pre-college programs. I have also considered work in academic advising, leadership education and development programs, admissions, and academic student success & retention programming. 

If I get into the area I would like to go into, college access, equity, and inclusion, I would like to work as a counselor/advisor for a few years and then work my way up. I could see myself in a Director's role where I am leading  college access & equity program and continuing and improving the vision for a program. 

I know that the master's program I am going to is counseling based and I will help me to utilize interpersonal skills and counseling techniques with students that I work with and that will be helpful. I know that I would like to pursue a doctorate once I have a good number of work expereince under my belt.

My goal for the doctorate would be to continue growing in knowledge of the profession and being able to apply that in the profession: hence to be a Practitioner-Scholar. I know that I do not want to have a position in academia. What I would like to focus on is in research concerning college access and equity for students of color and with students with invisible disabilities as well as researching transition from high school to college. I find it fascinating because it is a game changer in how a student is successful in higher education.

My question is what kind of doctoral program would be most useful and here are my thoughts:

1. Educational Leadership & Policy- Since I am looking to become a director, this would make the most logical sense since it deals with looking at educational policy and how it affects organizations of higher education. It would also get me to an area in which college access and equity are affected: policy. I firmly believe that in this area, knowing and applying policy and leadership in education will help future generations of students.

2. Higher Education/Student Affairs Administration- This is similar to the previous one above, but my only downfall is that it may fail to take into consideration anything outside of higher education. With what I want to get into, it involves looking at 6-12 and higher education together since what I am focusing on is college access and equity. Understanding both sides of the coin are critical to my knowledge about transition in terms of what happens in 6-12 but also what is happening in higher education.  I have examined some higher education admin programs but have not felt 100% about them unless I felt they met a certain need I might get.

So, What are you thoughts on this?

When looking at the doctoral programs, its not about ""EL vs. Higher Ed""... its understanding what your major professor and advisors are/have studing/ed, and how does that fit with what you want to research. 

I had a conversation with my senior director about looking into Doctoral programs, and he was pretty smart in telling me ""focus on it when you know you are ready to put aside 4 years of your life, and when you know you need it."" ",2018-06-08 08:34:37
8nntn2,Attending Graduate School at your undergraduate institution,"Hi everyone! I am beginning graduate school this fall at my alma mater to earn my M.Ed in Counseling Psychology with a Concentration in College Student Personnel Administration. Making the decision to attend my alma mater was NOT an easy one and I need some input on attending your alma mater for grad school and your expereince doing so and why. For the longest time, I had felt remorse for the decision I made but now I feel more confident in the decision I made. At times though, the feelings of my decision do come back. Let me break it down:

I applied to four graduate schools for student affairs administration in higher education (For purposes of anonymity I am going to call the schools by colors: purple U [my alma mater], U of orange, U of blue, and brown U [Not the actual university].)

I went through the motions of admissions and I received invites to interview from acceptances from all schools and an acceptance from U of Orange. Fast-forward, I did all my program interviews and/or assistantship interviews.

Here's what went down with acceptances:

Purple U- I received an offer of admission with my first choice assistantship I selected. From the interview day since I was an alumnus, since most everyone knows the campus, the process was pretty expedited and we wasted no time. I would have liked to chat with the current students a little bit which I did not have the opportunity to. Purple U was last on my list as a safety in case none of the other schools worked out; but it is a very strong and competitive program to get into (only taking 12 people per cohort so I was very fortunate to have received an *offer of admission*). Plus, they paid for all tuition and fees for each semester and I would get two practicums and two assistantships, guaranteed. I really loved the counseling emphasis of the program. My offer was time sensitive since it is an offer of admission and I only had a week to decide because they moved very quickly. Overall in my decision, I felt I needed to go somewhere different since I had been at the institution for 5.5 years as an undergrad. I felt that I would be reliving undergrad again, so I initially turned the offer down betting on other schools to give me an offer.

U of Orange- Even though I interviewed for 5 assistantships, they are technically not required to be a part of the program, but I knew I wanted one anyway. I waited for the longest time even after their spring break. No assistantship offers came in and it seemed like everyone else around me was getting offers left and right. I waited a LONG time, followed up, and nothing. (Even though I was admitted academically, an assistantship would waive the cost of tuition). I still waited on U of Orange for an offer even though I was accepted. They offered 12 month assistantships with health insurance that waived tuition but did not cover fees and the program was primarily administrative.

U of Blue- I was rejected from this school completely so it was a no-go there. It was not a right fit for me even during the assistantship interviews.

brown U [NOT the actual university]- This was probably the day I enjoyed the most. I had visited the school before hand because I had heard so many positive things about it and I was very impressed.  Everyone was most authentic there and there was a big emphasis on social justice. On the interview day, I had 8 interviews TPE style. Out of the 8,  I had gotten three 2nd round interviews. Followed up with them and I would hear back.  I was informed that the assistantships I interviewed with for 2nd rounds matched with other candidates. Hope was not lost because I found out weeks after I interviewed that I could interview with another site by phone that I did not interview with originally. I personally thought that this was a lot more work that I had to do especially going through the interviews. I still followed through any way. What I like about their program was its emphasis on social justice, student development theory, globalism (study abroad tours), and had a large alumni base. Their assistantships were 10 months but the catch was since my assistantships were off-campus, I would still have to pay tuition for a certain amount of credits and fees. In addition the cohort is much larger! 30+ per cohort. 

Here's the catch: Before I found out there was an opportunity to interview for another assistantship with brown U, I felt I had made a big mistake. I was in a bad spot with nothing to lean back on. U of Orange had not contacted me.  I felt bad rejecting Purple U so I called the coordinator and I told her my situation of not having any offers from any of the other institutions. She told me that if any other candidate declined that I would receive a second offer. Meanwhile, I set up my new assistantship phone interview with brown U. On the same day that I phone interviewed with brown, I received an offer from their assistantship site; but to make things tougher, I found out that someone from Purple U rejected an offer of admissions, so I received a second offer from my alma mater, purple U with my second choice assistantship preference. This time, I only had 24 hours to decide. To make things tougher, the offers I received for assistantships were all in the same area: Assistantship.

See the big decision?? brown with an offer from a ""wildcard"" assistantship site vs. purple with a second admissions offer and my second choice assistantship (which was my best interview). I was up all night trying to decide whether I would stay or go.

24 hours later, I had made the decision to stay at my alma mater purple and accept the offer; on the other side, I felt a bit of remorse because I had really connected with the people at brown and it felt genuine there. Purple on the other hand has a strong interview process and I have connections already. The interview day was different since it had purple alumni and current students interviewing only. I personally felt remorse with the decision of not choosing brown and it would take some time for me to know that I made the right decision with purple and staying at my alma mater.

So back to the question: Why did you decide to stay at your alma mater for graduate school? Did it give you advantages in the long run? I feel that staying where you went for undergrad can be stigmatized but I am learning that it's not always the case. Also, how did you handle being a graduate student and how did you differentiate yourself from your former undergraduate self? Is there something I am overthinking and overanalyzing with my decision? For those who have a spiritual life, how do you all view this? I am just really trying to come to peace and terms with my decision. I would really appreciate it!

",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/8nntn2/attending_graduate_school_at_your_undergraduate/,False,,10,"I didn't stay, but I went through a master's program where about 1/4 of my cohort were alums of the institution. The ones who were older, and took time off before starting their masters did a much better job of separating themselves from their college years. 

The ones who were fresh out of their bachelor's programs struggled a lot more. Some of them didn't make the best choices and/or were challenged with maintaining friendships with current undergrads while assuming assistantships that required them to create boundaries.

Unfortunately, you may have to create boundaries and distance yourself from some of your undergrad friends depending on the choices they make and how it could reflect on you (because now you have to be a role model). 

You might get some questions about it once you start job searching or looking for internships, but don't worry too much about it. Stay focused, lean on your faculty and supervisors for support, and do your best. I would definitely encourage internships at other schools while you do your masters, though. It's really helpful to see the culture at other schools. ",2018-06-01 09:10:27

87kj36,Do I have a future in Student Affairs/Higher Education?,"Hello there. 
I am a 25 year old currently working in a non-profit (mainly data, administrative tasks and event support). I am strongly considering a master's degree in Student Affairs/Higher Education. A brief synopsis of my ""stats"":

-Degree: Bachelor in Health Services Administration
-GPA: 3.71 Overall 3.68 Major GPA
-Work Experience: During college I was a part of of TRiO, which focused primarily on supporting first-generation students. As A first-gen myself, I was highly involved during my school years, because a tutor for transitional students, was a part of creating the inaugural club for the program, etc. etc. 

My worry is that I graduated in 2014 so it has been 4 years since I have been in a college environment. During my time away from college, I worked an administrative role for a health insurance company for 2 years, as a teacher for 1, and currently as a data coordinator for a scholarship and mentorship nonprofit for high school students. 

I have a strong interest in career development/academic advising/first generation student support. It is something I have considered since my senior year of graduation, but never bit the bullet for. I just do not want to set myself up for disappointment. Would consideration for an assistantship be pushing it as well?

7r6u6i,Social Media and Networking,"So, I have used social media since 2008 with Facebook. Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr followed after when I entered college. I tried Twitter briefly but I really did not like it. The only network I use online is LinkedIn. As I transition to graduate school I know that social media is more critical than ever in connecting with others, especially students; however, I have personally stopped using social media for the sake of my mental health. I lost sleep and even felt waves of depression and low self-esteem from using it. I feel like sometimes I am missing out on conversations if I don't have social media and I have been debating whether I will go back. I have found it better for me to stay away from it because it can become visual noise if the proper filters are not put in place to make for a productive time on social media. If I were to go back, it would at most be Facebook and Twitter. What is some advice you all have?

7hef04,Student Affairs in Higher Education Masters Programs- Advice,"Hi everyone!

I am new to the Reddit society so this is like my maiden voyage. I am graduated about a year ago and took a gap year to get away from academi

I have just applied to 4 Student affairs programs for the 2018-2019 academic year:

James Madison University: Counseling Psychology, College Student Personnel Administration (my alma mater)

The University of Tennessee-Knoxville:College Student Personnel 

University of North Carolina @ Greensboro:  Student Affairs Administration in Higher Education

Bowling Green State University: College Student Personnel.

I am really excited to see where I am accepted. As I think about the process, I am thinking about all the factors to consider. Some major factors I am considering:

1. Cost- With a good amount of student debt on my shoulders, I am really considering everything I can to think about *reducing debt as much as possible while also choosing a program that has a great fit.* I am originally from Virginia so JMU would be the only school being in-state. I am also considering tuition and fees (especially fees because they add up). Right now every program covers tuition in some way or form.

2. Personal Growth & goals- I was at my alma mater as an undergrad for 5.5 years and so I have spent a lot of time. I am sort of in a dilemma as to whether I need a new experience going out-of-state or whether I should stay at my alma mater. I know that one of my long term career goals is to be a College Planning Education Consultant so I am looking at doing an internship hopefully. I would also want experience in enrollment management (financial aid and admissions), academic advising, and career services.) I 

3. Curriculum & Practical Experiences- This was something I looked closely at seeing the courses. Some have rigid curriculum where every class is mapped out and some have required courses with a choice of electives from different areas. I know that I have an interest in Counseling and Student Development & Learning. Personally, I am not sure which type of curriculum I would go for. I have looked at the curriculum and researched every course description. In addition, I know the amount of experiences that each program has (assistantships, internships, and practicum.)

4. Cohort Size- I have considered a small cohort and a large one. Each having their pros and cons.

So, there's the overview of my thoughts in a nutshell. What are your thoughts and do you all have some suggestions to think about as I consider decisions in the admissions process?

I'm in my first semester of a student affairs MA program.  My class is 27 people or so.  

I am trying to gage how often I should contribute to conversations.  There are few students in the class who are disengaged, and everyone has a different opinion on a topic.  Everyone wants to share what they've experienced, learned or created.  I worry that sometimes I contribute a little too much.  I have asked classmates if they think so, and they haven't noticed, but I'm feeling this way for some reason.

How do you ensure that you speak enough to earn the maximum participation points for the class, but also give others a chance to earn their points and contribute to the conversation?

Does this seem reasonable or is there any other ideas that might be able to boost my application.

I have worked for the past 4 years in the Student Affairs office for a Medical School and would like to working in advising and/or registration. I do a bit of both currently. Also, are there any other degrees that could give me a leg up on these areas?  I have a graduate certificate in Counselor Education, but was thinking about [College Counseling and Student Development](https://ced.ncsu.edu/programs/college-counseling-and-student-development-master/) as a possible alternative.

I actually took a similar course of action that you're considering. I got my Graduate Certificate in Student Affairs while working. It seems to have benefited me as I was able to more clearly articulate why I wanted the masters and how it would benefit me. 

I also served on several committees that gave me great networking and practical experience/viewpoints. Since I had a sub-3.0 GPA in undergrad, I'm 100% confident that getting the certificate, extra work experience, and being on committees is what helped me get accepted to my #2 and #3 schools this time around (still waiting to hear back from #1) by proving that I can do the graduate level work and that I'm committed to the field.

3ylgz5,Have I messed up too badly?,"Hello this may not be the best subreddit for my questions and concerns but I couldn't find any better place to ask these questions, so please forgive me if this isn't the right place. 

I'm a sophomore at a local in state university and as of last spring semester I was put onto academic probation as I was struggling with a full 18 credit course load on top of depression and growing anxiety of being overwhelmed with all the new information and life style that comes with being on my own and in charge of my life. 

This being said as I came into this fall semester I decided to reach for a more difficult engineering major and decided that because I was on academic probation and behind in the study as far as course go I needed to take a rugid bit light 15 credit course load. 

However I ended up taking Chemistry(which I never took in high school) and an advanced physics course for engineering majors. I did not do well as the new concepts of chemistry was very difficult to learn and so I spent too much time on that one subject meanwhile everything else didn't get much time focused on it. This led to me getting a horrible GPA of a 1.55 for this semester and dragging my cumulative GPA down under a 2.0 when my goal for this semester was to achieve a 2.2 at the bare minimum to appease my academic progress plan. 

I feel like such a failure after actually putting as much effort into the semester as I could and so far the college has dismissed me and has offered an appeal process for both the dismissal and a reevaluation of my academic standing and financial aid.

I'm in a two-year masters program, and right now my assistantship is in res life. Of course, I'm learning valuable transferable skills, but I 100% know that I'm not interested in working in res life when I graduate. 

My question is, should I stay with my assistantship for another year, or try to land one in a different functional area? Do hiring managers for entry-level positions have a preference for multiple GA experiences versus just one?

Thanks for your input! ",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/3q7iwv/various_gaships_or_just_one_which_is_better/,False,,3,"I am a graduate student myself so I can't speak from a hiring perspective, but I would probably say there isn't one answer to this question. At the end of the day, it is about creating the experience you are looking for to be prepared for your career.

Through my graduate program I have opted to have two long-term hands-on experiences as opposed to a wider variety of short-term experiences. This is mostly because I have a specific area of interest and I would like to gain depth of knowledge within these areas. Other students are still exploring functional areas and career options. For these students, breath of knowledge may be the best option.

In your case, I would consider what type of work your do want to do upon graduation. If there is an opportunity to get this experience by switching assistantships, than that may be the best option. But you can get a lot of transferable skills through res life, so I wouldn't necessarily switch just for the sake of switching. There may also be other ways to gain experience in other areas such as through summer internships or practicum opportunities. ",2015-10-26 07:16:53

3k672o,Too many units to change majors?,"I'm a student at UCI that transferred from a JC last year.  I'm wanting to change majors and meet the general GPA requirements, but I've been denied for two listed reasons:

-I have too many units

-I don't have a particular class that completes the general intro classes for the major


I explained that I was willing to go back to a JC to get the class I needed and reapply, but was told that probably wasn't an option since I already had too many units.

Why is having too many units a bad thing?  Do I have any other obvious options that I'm not seeing?",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/3k672o/too_many_units_to_change_majors/,False,,4,"A few things: 

- You can only transfer a maximum number of credits from a JC to a 4 year (usually around 60, [this](http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/files/uc-transfer-maximum-limitation-policy-chart.pdf) says 75), so it may be pointless to go back to a JC. Another option is that if you've already exceeded the 75 transfer credit maximum, you'll have to swap out transfer courses to not exceed the credit maximum. Also, some majors could have a cap on the number of transfer credits allowed for that major.

- There's usually a maximum number of credits that you can take at a JC before running out of financial aid, but that's a ridiculous number. When I worked at another institution, it was 275 quarter credits (so whatever that would be in semester credits). The rest of the financial aid can only be applied to a 4 year so maybe your advisor doesn't want you to pay out of pocket for classes? 

- Your advisor may want you to graduate on time for data purposes. Schools are so obsessed with data (graduation rates, transfer rates, etc.) that your advisor may be trying to get you to graduate to make their graduation stats look good. 

- Are you currently in a non-popular major? If so, losing students in specific majors could mean losing funding for the department.

- What do you mean by general GPA requirements? Like you're trying to raise your GPA to get into a pro-school type of program? 

- Why can't you take the pre-req at UCI instead of going to a JC?

- Would you be able to take the pre-req at a JC during the summer so it doesn't interfere with your academic year courses? Taking a break in enrollment at UCI could affect your chances of re-enrolling. The way that the UC/CSU system is impacted, there's no guarantee that you'll be able to just re-enroll once the course is done, but you should talk to an admissions advisor to be sure. 

- There's a combination of reasons as to why you were told not to change majors or your advisor could just suck in general.  ",2015-09-09 09:16:34

360ra7,Help Share Info on Research Study on Men Who Survived Sexual Violence During College,"My name is Dr. Dan Tillapaugh, and I am a faculty member in the Higher Education program at the University of Maine. In the information below, I have provided some further insights about my research study on men who have survived sexual violence and/or coercion in college over the past 10 years.

Background of the Study: Issues of sexual violence at colleges and universities within the United States have been prominent in the media for many years. However, in recent years, increased attention and enforcement of Title IX and governmental oversight has shown a bright spotlight on the issue for many colleges and universities. As a result, campus administrators have devoted greater efforts at education and outreach on issues of sexual violence on campus. Yet, much of the conversation around gender-based or sexual violence tends to reinforce the fallacy that women are the only victims of sexual violence on college campuses.

Purpose of the Study: This study aims to understand the experiences of men (either cisgender or transgender) who have survived sexual violence and/or coercion during their college experience (this could be during one’s undergraduate or graduate school experiences) within the past 10 years (between 2005-2015). In particular, this study aims to understand their experiences in reporting (or deciding not to report such violence), the support (or lack thereof) they received from campus administrators, faculty, peers, and families, and what resources, services, and initiatives they wish campus administrators would know about men who are survivors of sexual violence on campus.

Procedure: Individuals who wish to participate will be interviewed twice, with each interview taking approximately one hour, during the summer and fall of 2015. These interviews will be conducted with the researcher via phone or by Skype, whichever the participant prefers. Additionally, participants will be invited to an optional online focus group in spring 2016 following initial data analysis. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, participants are welcome to have a support person (such as a close friend or family member) with them during the interviews. In all parts of the study, you can choose to skip any questions that you would prefer not to answer. You can also stop your participation in the study at any time without judgment or question.

Contact Information: To learn more about this study or to express interest in participating, please visit my research study website at www.cmsvsurvivors.com or you can e-mail me directly at daniel.tillapaugh@gmail.com

Your help is much appreciated in spreading the word about this study.  Please consider sharing the link (www.cmsvsurvivors.com) on your social media sites and also to professionals on your campus (such as Title IX Coordinators, health and wellness professionals) who might also be willing to share it with others.

2tlkvr,Question about Career path,"Hello All,

I'm in an interesting conundrum about attending graduate level education in Higher Education/Student Affairs.  

During undergraduate I had several para-professional positions (RA/Student Orientation) and really enjoyed my experience.  After graduating I've worked several years in the non-profit/advocacy world and have managed to hold several mid-level managerial positions for major nonprofit. I have about 5 years of profesional experience in LGBTQ/Advocacy related work and am in the 40 - 60k salary range.

I love my current work but I have nagging need for more education and a real love for student leadership development (I've specifically focused on the training of LGBTQ students in advocacy skills). 

I've been accepted to a great HESA program, but I'm concerned that in many ways it will be a step back for me monetarily.  Will my past experience help me into higher positions that would have better pay than most out of grad school jobs?

Also I have another internal dilemma if I want to go all the way and obtain my doctorates? Do any of you have good sources for the higher potential of a phd in Higher Ed or Administration?

I really appreciate any insight!",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/2tlkvr/question_about_career_path/,False,,2,"In addition to what has already been offered, a few other thoughts:

The salary for a position depends greatly on geography (among other things). Mid-level positions in some parts of the country make less than entry level jobs in California, but the cost of living is also very different. So you very well could find an entry level job that pays you 45k, or a mid-level job that pays close to 60k, but you might be paying 1.5-2k a month for rent or having a few roommates. 

Is there a way for you to continue in your current work and go to school part time or on a different schedule that a full time student? Will your current office support you (emotionally, structurally, financially)?

Your past experience will certainly help you get interviews different positions right out of an MA program, and could help you negotiate a higher starting salary than the base of the position (since almost all positions are within a class that has a salary range). 

Also, it might be worth thinking about the idea that you don't have to go into working at a college with a HESA degree. There are lots of jobs that still do a lot of work with college students and impact the experiences of students that are not situated within a university, and have a lot of crossover with the non-profit world. Having an MA will also help you get different access to these types of positions and at higher levels. 

Good luck. ",2015-01-25 16:21:19

2l7dss,Can undergraduate resident assistants be made to clean up bodily fluid as part of their expectations?,"I am a (graduate assistant) Hall Director at a small semi-rural university. The university does not have extensive resources when it comes to handling situations after hours. Part of the expectations of the on-duty resident assistants is that they will clean up bodily fluid ""spills"" if found after hours, or over the course of the weekend. They are given small kits with absorbent powders, expected to scrape all of the mess into a bio hazard bag, and then leave the bag in the hall office until the next morning or Monday. 

Resident Assistants at this particular university have never received any specialized training for this type of endeavor and it is usually a ""learn as you go"" experience for them. While I'm sure you are all aware of the broader context of why I am posing this question, I would like to keep responses general as to whether it is even legal to require undergraduate staff to clean up bodily fluids, inclusive of blood, vomit, and urine as part of their expectations. 

Edit: Are there any other subreddits I could xpost this question to? 

Update: According to the individual at OSHA that I spoke with over the phone today: if the bodily fluid does not contain blood then it doesn't fall under the regulations associated with medical waste and ""blood born pathogens"". As such, there is no specifically mandated training required, but the institution should have ""some form"" of training where the staff members who are expected to clean up vomit and other fluids are shown proper procedures and informed of communicable diseases.

I was very much against the idea of need-based admission but, after working at a fairly pricey school and having to tell countless gifted students that they can't afford to attend their dream school, I'm starting to think need-blind admission might not be the great equalizer it tries to be. 

Perhaps it works in schools that can afford to offer full rides to their underprivileged students but not at schools that have a gap between their maximum financial aid award and the cost of attendance?

I've also heard it argued that it isn't so much that schools are need-blind; they're need-ignorant. Institutions don't have time to consider if a student could afford to attend because they're too busy trying to fill beds/seats at the beginning of the admission process.

What do you think?",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/26340l/needbased_vs_needblind_admission/,False,,3,"Solution: Need-blind admission, need-based financial aid. Eligibility for the two should be independent of each other.

I agree that neither need-based nor need-blind admission is a solution, but I think need-blind admission has its merits when coupled with need-based aid. ",2014-05-21 10:20:30

20uu2a,Certification VS MA in Student Affairs (or related),"Good Afternoon Fellow Redditors,


tl;dr:

1. Is a certificate for student services/affairs worth it or should I get a post-bacc degree? I have a BA in English. I have lots of experience in the career services department but nothing else from my University.

2. Can I start from the bottom and work my way up a career ladder in this field? I am prepared and determined to do that.

**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**

I am researching a few career paths to figure out where I should go next. I graduated in May 2013 and was fortunate to get a decent job (experience-wise) right out of college. I work as the Reading Intervention Specialist at an Elementary school. Essentially I work with various students from Kinder to 3rd grade who score below grade level reading averages. I work with them on a very intriguing computer program run through Scientific Learning, and I also coordinated and manage an after school reading program.

There are many things I love about my job, but I can't stay here. I've always had an interest in Student Affairs, and there are a few jobs I've got my eye on. However, **I feel unqualified.** Some of these jobs ask for an MA, but others don't. 

[This Article](http://chronicle.com/article/Getting-a-Start-in-Student/125391/) states that getting a certificate could be an alternative route, but I don't want to waste my time. From your experience, do you think the certificate is worth the time/money, or should I look at an MA path? I already turned down a graduate school that accepted me this year. While I want to go to grad school eventually . . . It doesn't seem logical for me to get a degree in something I'm not even sure I want to do.

It focuses more on 1:1 interactions, is planned and outcome-focused. 

One really great tool we used were resident interviews. Each RA was required to have a 15-20 minute conversation with each resident. Some of the RA's chose to have sign-ups, some of them wanted it to be more organic. At the beginning of the year it was very ""get to know you"" (major, hometown, why you came to the institution) and later on we asked specific questions we wanted to know like, ""how are you getting along?, are you involved?, do you feel you can study in the hall?, do you have friends in the hall?"" 

My RA's were really hesitant at the idea of interviewing everyone and thought it would be really awkward but some of them had one hour conversations. The truth is, especially with freshman, they just want to be heard! Yeah they may have tons of friends, or none at all, but students are just swept up in being in college. 

So to get back to your problem, this was great for setting a foundation of trust and mutual respect and while students would still violate policy, they felt terrible when confronted by their own RA or didn't want her to find out because they didn't want to disappoint her. 

I think something like this might be helpful to build trust and create relationships. I think they need to see their RA as a peer and this is a great way to do it!

Do you feel that there is validity to using MBTI for this process? Do you use something similar? 

Edit: Here is the chart the student provided for me. I'm still working on the source. http://i.imgur.com/mDd6gPE.png",studentaffairs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/1hv05m/mbti_and_firstyear_pairings/,False,,4,"You know, I think this is a great experiment. But I've been really into MBTI stuff lately.

I don't think putting similar types together should be the goal, but complimentary types. Or, you could always ask what their preference is in addition to what their MBTI type is. For example, say they are an introvert. You can ask whether they would prefer to be paired with another introvert (reasons include: would like their room to be a quiet place to study, don't like many visitors, have extreme social anxiety, etc.) or with an extrovert (reasons include: they want to get out more, get out of their comfort zone, make friends, meet new people, experience living with someone much different from themselves, etc.). There are good and recommended introvert/introvert pairings as well as introvert/extrovert pairings.

I don't think there's anything wrong with asking for personal preferences and applying them to the selection. People want different things out of college; you can't force them to all have the same experience if it isn't what they are looking for. Some want to focus on making friends, some want to focus on their studies, some want to focus on trying new things...and so on. They are paying to create their own college experience. Not what someone else thinks their college experience should be.

Is there a good amount of research going into this before implementation? MBTI can be extremely complicated. It's not just personality types, in fact it's not meant to indicate personality but rather it gives insight to how an individual functions, to their very core. Some types pretty downright clash with others, 90% of the time; NTs and SFs, for example. ",2013-07-08 20:57:28

gzxlym,"Definition of ""Course Registration""","Hello all,

Long story short, I last took a course at my local college in 2013. In 2017, I signed up for and then within 10 minutes immediately withdrew from the course.

In addition, my unofficial transcript does not show the withdrawal, and doesn't even show the semester, but they have some internal record where they see this.

There is a program, per college policy, ""...available only to students who have not registered for courses at the college for a minimum of five consecutive years."" that I would like to apply for.

I'm trying to make the argument that I was not registered for any courses since 2013. I'm trying to find a definition or any supporting argument for why I've not been registered since 2013.

Edit after I read the question over a bit better: Do they have an AP&P (academic policies and procedures) committee? You can sometimes make an appeal and petition for them to hear your case. Get supporting evidence from academic records/your registrar’s office, a copy of your transcript (unofficial should suffice if it’s the same campus) and see if you can write a letter pleading your case. 

Check your college catalog. There should be older versions online from the time you registered. Check their policies, too.

Since you likely added and dropped within the add/drop period, it won’t show on your transcript. That’s kinda proof enough. If you waited and got a W, then it would count against you. ",2020-06-10 06:14:41

I chose my grad program because and knew I didn’t want a Higher Ed MA so I would have options down the road. 

I do have experience in res life from undergrad which has helped. Since that is not your case, I would advocate to still pursue a MA and it will be what you put in.

It’s now two weeks and I plan on following up next week during week 3.

If the institution has decentralized HR (each department has an HR person), it might go a little quicker. Centralized HR (one HR office for the whole campus) seems to go a little slower in my experience. Sometimes if a department is anticipating someone will leave (i.e. retirement, relocation, etc), they may be ready to post pretty quickly after they resign. If it's a surprise that might take longer. Time of year also can affect things. If it's a busy season, the office may delay hiring until things slow down. Some places also delay until closer to the new fiscal year.  ",2019-02-22 00:34:24

92por4,Pre-College/College Access,"Hey everyone! I am getting ready to start my degree in the fall for Student Affairs. I just had a summer job working for a pre college enrichment program that basically allows high school students a collegiate expereince on a college campus. This ranges from Prep courses, academy courses, and summer college courses (for credit). After expereincing this and seeing the range of possibilities I realize pre college/ college access programs are my primary areas that I would like to pursue, in addition to academic advising, admissions, and First-Year Expereince as alternative s. 

Within Pre-College/College Access, I know there is : TRiO, Education Opportunity Programs, college access non-profits, Summer Bridge programs, and seasonal Pre-College programs (summer programs/ dual enrollment). Within this, I would like to consider working with underrepresented student populations, including first gen students.

My questions are first if there is any scholarly literature from practitioners on these matters, second, are there people with expereinces in pre college programs for high school and /or middle school students, and lastly, what are some recommendations in terms of functional areas to get involved in since my campus does not have an area available like this?

8o5asv,Assistantship/Practica Options,"I will be a first-year graduate student this fall and I am trying to be as prepared as possible to know exactly what expereinces I would like to have. I will be back at my alma mater, JMU in their College Student Personnel Program that requires (an) assistantship(s) for two years [1 assistantship for 2 years or 2 assistantships for two years... I will be going for the second option]. It also requires two practica. The practica can be done with both during the school year or one during the school year and one during the summer (typically after the first year, which I will most likely do).

As I am thinking about my goals and what I want long term,

Career-wise, I am thinking primarily about going into: 
-**Pre-College, TriO, Higher Education Opportunity, and Summer Bridge Programs** (1st Choice)
-**First-Year Experience** (Focusing on programming for First-Year Students after Orientation)
-**Academic Advising** and/or **Career Services & Development** but preferrably Academic Advising

I already have my first Assistantship set in Leadership though the Dux Leadership Center. My options for my second assistantship are briefly:

1st Choice- Centennial Scholars Program- basically a program designed for underrepresented student who receive financial support, as well as mentorship, and service opportunities throughout their four years. This one struck me as the go to since I want to work in an area like this after grad school.

2nd Choice- Career & Academic Planning- Due to my interest in Academic Advising and Career Services, this would be a great assistantship to go into especially since I would like to start out as an academic counselor or advisor in Pre-college/Higher Ed/Summer bridge/TriO programs

3rd Choice - Academic Student Services- I think this is important because some students will have tough spots in their life and this office helps with the recovery of students who have have faced some type of academic disciplinary action. It's especially good to understand when working with students looking to succeed in college.

For practicum during the summer I am looking at getting trying to do an internship with a TRiO Upward Bound program or one of similar nature with NODA or ACUHO-I. For the practicum during the academic I am looking here are my options:

1st Choice- Practicum with **Blue Ridge Community College**- Basically I would get expereince working at a community college in a variety of functional areas including: counseling, academic advising, career services, admissions, learning communities, student activities, learning support, and disability services. This would also allow me to get a different expereince outside of JMU since I know JMU really well.

2nd Choice- **Bridgewater College- Career Services**- Another option to consider that is off campus at a nearby institution since , again, getting away from JMU would be good and would also fit into the areas I am looking at long term.

-------------------The rest on this list are all on campus practica--------------------

3rd Choice- Diversity Office

4th Choice- Financial Aid

5th Choice- Diversity Office

6th Choice- Center for Assessment and Research Studies- Student Affairs Assessment Support Services

Second, when I interviewed for my Advisor role, they asked a lot of general advising questions: what is your advising technique/approach? How do you go about advising students? What are some challenges students face? (in whatever area you are interviewing for, mine was Career Services). 

They MAY also ask you more questions about how you would handle specific scenarios with students. Altogether, what I’m trying to say is try your best to prepare and think of some questions that they may ask related to advising. Don’t bring up your lack of experience, etc. Just practice ahead of time and that will help you gain some confidence when they ask about your advising skills. ",2018-05-25 05:52:11
8k5lb8,Question about discrimination,"Hello I have a quick question regarding a situation regarding a graduate school I am familiar with, and I was hoping to get some insight.

The Graduate School in question has many upper level defense and national security personnel acting as faculty, however the school is a non-profit, open institution eligible to anyone who applies and is accepted (including international students).

I'm hearing that a student from the Middle East (I believe from Iran), may be denied entry to the school because certain members of the faculty have a problem teaching subjects pertaining to national security to citizens of countries the USA does not have a good relationship with.

However, this student is already studying in the states on a F-1 Visa, and according to the government should be allowed to study wherever he chooses and gets accepted too. Mind you, this institution is public, not private, and the faculty member in question is only upset because he claims his security clearance won't allow him to work with this type of student.

7k1jbj,Higher Ed College Planning Consulting- Post Masters Credentials,"So, I have been doing some research on what is needed to become an College Transition Counselor/College Planning Consulting. I have been researching credentials that I would need beyond the master's degree. I am planning on getting my masters in College Student Personnel (Administration)/Student Affairs Administration [however you would like to call it]. After working for an office of my choice, I would like to begin eventually working part-time as a consultant taking on only a few clients. Another certification I would need is a College Educational Planner (CEP) certification by the IECA (Independent Educational Consultants Association) by UC Irvine.  
The other thing is that I have considered is a doctoral degree; however with the topic matter of college planning and transition, I am not sure what doctoral degree I should be pursuing or even if a doctoral degree should be something looking towards.

616yfp,Question About Student Rights for Working Outside of Class,"I am curious what rights students have in terms of working difficult hour outside of class.

I am currently in a class where, in addition to having our four hour classes twice a week, we must work outside of the class every single day, including weekends to work on a group project (with no division of labor, which in a team of 15 people makes progress nearly impossible). I am used to doing work outside of class, especially with groups, this but this class in particular requests an unreasonable amount of time from me. 

I would mention the fact that we had to stay here for spring break and work from 9:30-6 but that was an expectation that was voiced before I joined the class. Instead, I would like to talk about all the other times that our teacher expects us to literally work throughout the night to complete our work, all of which is subjectively graded. Every single day our group meets for hours on end to complete work that our teacher ultimately tells us she doesn't like. She tells us this in class, sends us to work on it outside of class, and then in class continues to criticize our work instead of working on it with us while we are together, creating a cycle of endless criticism and fruitless work.

Most nights I am working from 5PM until 10 or 11PM which I have gotten used to, but last night our teacher and TAs wanted us to work until 2AM. I understand that some students are used to that kind of timeline and even thrive on it, but I always set myself up to not have to face those kinds of time restrictions. This is a group project so everyone is expected to work together all the time. 

Instead of staying until 2AM I left at midnight, explaining how I have work today and didn't think getting a decent night of sleep was a large ask. However, I was reprimanded for my early exit (at midnight) and was told that I was not meeting the expectations of the class and was not respecting people's time. 

I want to ensure that I am protected from getting a poor grade simply because I worked from 9 to 12 instead of 9 to 2AM, or even 3, 4 or 5AM as some of my classmates have.

5x2ust,Entering Job Market Advice,"Hey everyone! Just for some background, I'm a senior at a UC graduating in mid-June with a double major in neurobiology and music, and I was hoping to get some advice regarding attaining a position in academic advising.


This past school year, I've been working for our music department as a peer advisor. Since I pursued a double major and experienced a somewhat less conventional and more hectic college curriculum pathway, I've advised a lot of students with primary fields of study within and outside of the department. Through training for the position alone, I gained familiarity with the typical advising approaches the university advisors use and those endorsed by NACADA, e.g. holistic, appreciative, narrative, etc., and I'm also about to finish an Academic Peer Advising Certificate program offered by the school's advising center. I've consistently held student leadership positions since my sophomore year and have a lot of experience with student outreach for individuals of diverse backgrounds.


Are there any specific things I should be doing when I apply for entry-level academic advisor positions, and if I'm graduating in June, when's a good time to seriously start applying? During interviews, I plan on highlighting specific experiences employing certain advising techniques and my ability to work with diverse student populations and understand the present-day issues they face.


Also, how good/bad are my chances of landing a job in California specifically, given that I don't possess a master's? I'm aware that it would make me more qualified, but if possible, I would rather go into the industry after college and complete a master's part-time a few years down the road once I'm more financially settled.

1. On campus housing guaranteed 2 semesters. (over $700/month)
2. Basement suite one year lease. 7min walk to school. (under $600/month)

Tricky part:
I have co-op terms randomly placed, so like this school year I have one second semester. Next year I will have one first semester and then that summer. So if I got with option 2, I will need to sublet to a female (landlords only request) during these 4 month co-op terms. Usually people who take those sublets are other students who are coming back from a co-op and need a place to stay while they are back at school, or else exchange students that come for a semester. So if I don't find someone to sublet to then I have to pay empty rent. Whereas with option 1 I can just leave with no financial penalty.

-What is the best offer for you financially?
Which of the positions are going to offer you a financial package that is going to mean you are able to live comfortably and without taking on to much debt? Make sure you factor in the amount you will be paid against the cost of rent, groceries, etc. Does it come with a meal plan or other food options that you won't have to spend money on? 

-Are you going to get a broad range of experiences that will make you a competitive candidate?
If you are only repeating the same experiences you had as an undergrad, will that help you get the jobs you want after you get your degree? Are there populations that you have yet to work with (veterans, international students, foster youth) that might make your experience stand out? Are you going to get to do new things and be challenged in new ways in the position?

-Office Fit
Do you get along with the people with whom you would be working? Does the office have a culture you can fit into well enough (things like expecting people to be there at 8am or allowing you to set your own schedule)? Are you going to interact with students to a level that you want? Does this office include its GAs on external committees? Who are the other GAs (if any) and do you get along with them and can you work well with them?

Those are some of the biggest questions I would want to have answered. You can also talk them through with mentors and other associates to get some perspective. Don't be afraid to trust your gut, if it doesn't feel right it might not be.

I am now just a few credits shy of a BS in Sociology from Oregon State University, and I will be 32 when I graduate. I identify as male. I do not have a stellar transcript, due mostly to my first attempt at school, but also to a few hiccups along the way. I will graduate with a GPA in the 3.4 range, but my main worry is some unfortunate withdraws and a few F's that remain on my record from ten years ago.

That being said, I have had so many amazing opportunities my second go round. I quickly became an officer in Sociology Club (three years running now) and an advocacy group for incarcerated peoples. I have studied inside of prisons as part of the Inside Out program, I have studied abroad with a group in Cuba, and alone as an independent studies project in Nicaragua, I have presented at two conferences and will present at one more this spring, and I was selected to visit the White House for a seminar put on by some big names, including the First Lady. All of these opportunities came to me because I worked for them, applied myself, got to know my professors and others on campus who encourage me to apply. 

The difference between me now and then is amazing, as my first go round I was shy, participated in nothing, and really didn't want to be in school. My desire is to help people realize their full potential and to connect them with the endless learning opportunities at our institutions. 

I think that Student Affairs is for me, but aside from my few acquaintances who work in the field, I don't know much about what you actually do. So I'd like to ask two questions, and a bonus. 

1) What does your job currently entail, and are you happy?
1) What advice do you have for a person looking into Masters programs?
Bonus) Should I go for it?

As an afterword, I am interested in practice, but I also have a background in, and love, research. I am also a theory nerd. Unfortunately most programs I have looked at don't place much emphasis on either theory or research. Any thoughts?

Thank you so much :)

I agree with /u/xconorx that your personal best fit will be driven by preferred subject/focus (ed philosophy, counseling, etc.).  However, I would say a top program will, in general: 

* Take two years.  There are couple of one year programs that are respected, but by and large you have so much to learn that one year just isn't enough.  

* Pay for you (entirely or very close to it) through an assistantship.


* Give you an opportunity to learn from and interact with top researchers and authors in the field (ideally, in a spread of specialities within student affairs, but some programs are heavy in one area)

* Gives a balance between theory and practice (this is heavily linked with the assistantship piece).  Most top MA programs should give you a fighting chance at admission into a doc program, and a curriculum that is heavily practice-focused can be a tough sell.

* This is more of a personal opinion, but I'm going to say it will have a cohort model.  There might be a few exceptions to that, but having a cohort gives support and continuity that can be really important.   

So, given those criteria, my short list: UMD, Ohio State, University of Indiana, UConn, Georgia, Bowling Green, Vermont, USC.   ",2014-10-20 22:18:41

2fax68,Graduation Situation with my University,"I am currently a Senior at a small private university in Austin, Texas. For the past 4 years I went from Accounting, Accounting Information Technology, to Computer Science which is the degree I will graduate with. 

I spent my freshman year of college at UTSA (sorry so this is my 5th year total in college, 4 at this private school) where I took a 4 hour German class because it was required there. This will come in to play later

I have been advised by 3 different advisors (because of degree changes) and up until 2 days ago, none of them told me I still needed 2 hours of German which is a University wide policy. I talked to my advisor, dean, and VP of Academic Affairs, but none of them are putting any responsibility of this complete screw up on the hands of my advisors. They say I either have to take another 3 hours at COmunity College or CLEP it to get my degree this Spring. 

To me this is completley unfair that I have to do this. I was never told the past 4 years about this until my current advisor brought it to my attention.

However, it was surprising the amount of wild conjecture, derp and anti-immigrant BS present in such a short article.  For non-STEM majors, OPT is a 12 month long 'opportunity' to gain U.S. work experience.  If students are lucky, it is an entry level job in their field, often it is interning or volunteering without pay because good luck getting someone to hire you with those restrictions.  Regulations state that employment is to be reported within 10 days.  HOWEVER, regulations also state that students are permitted 90 days of unemployment - how does one track this in any meaningful way?

I'd love to see his data on how many students and DSOs are 'abusing the system.'

1prxiw,Preparing for HE/SA master's programs,"Around the time I finished undergrad, I realized that a) I didn't want to do a PhD in my field and b) I'm interested in student affairs (primarily academic advising). Therefore, I have a pretty good sense of what PhD programs care about, but I now need to figure out what HE/SA programs are looking for in an applicant, partly for me and partly for the sake of future recommenders. 

For example, in PhD applications, letters of recommendation are a big factor, and programs want to see letters that vouch for your strong intrinsic motivation and potential to do scholarly research. I know my undergrad advisor could attest to those things, but would HE/SA programs care? I assume research potential isn't important if you're not aiming for a research degree or a research career. My advisor is likely not very familiar with what HE/SA programs want to know about. Is there some kind of advice or how-to sheet I could give my letter-writers if they want it? (Something like [this](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/) but for HE/SA.) Or are LoRs not a big deal in this field?

And for me, what is an ideal number of years of relevant work experience? People on Grad Cafe say a two-year master's program is better if you're thin on experience, but how thin is thin? How long should you have worked if you're interested in a one-year program? (I'd be happy to do two years in principle, but some programs I really like for other reasons are one year.) I'm not planning to apply for at least a year or two, or more if that's advisable.

There are quite a few ""how to get into grad school"" books for other types of grad school, but I haven't found any that deal with HE/SA programs. Any recommendations?

Besides GPA, GRE, SoP, LoRs, and work experience, is there anything else important I should know about? Is volunteer experience a big deal in this field? And if so, how directly relevant to HE/SA does the experience need to be for admissions committees to care?

This is where I lived my freshman year at Appalachian State University, in the Living Learning Center. I was in a program called Watauga Global Community. We all lived in the LLC together and we took the majority of our freshman classes together, also we had a lunch together twice a week. It was wonderful. Instead of a freshman seminar, I took a class on immigration. Instead of a sophomore level class, I took a class on all of the beat writers. All of these classes are located in our dorm, or in the adjacent building.

The thing about the program was that we were able to form friendships that wouldn't be possible on main campus. We're the anti-greek life, basically. The people I was in the program with are still my best friends, even three years later. We were paired up with members of the class above us and they're still close friends. Wataugans stick together. We take care of each other. 

Also in the LLC were international students, Teaching Fellows, and Language and Culture students. We called it Hogwarts because it was located up above main campus and we had four houses. ",2012-08-05 07:34:05

The thing is that I don't know how the professional world is. I don't know if, when you get hired, they provide you with some kind of training for you to reach a good level... I guess I am not the only one that will end the university with lower level than the requiered one so...

Now, not all jobs are ideal. There are positions where you have to be able to hit the ground running with very little hand holding.

RESIST! 

May 28th, 2014

Students from across the University of North Carolina system have taken to the streets in recent months to demand an education system that they can graduate from without taking on crushing student debt. Dozens of students marched to the offices of North Carolina Governor and House Speaker Thom Tillis on May 23rd to deliver a letter with their demandsfor a truly affordable higher education system. 

The action came on the heels of an April 11th march and press conference and a 500-student walk out in February before that, all to protest against budget cuts and tuition hikes that the North Carolina government is forcing onto students of the UNC system.


And they’re just getting started.

The Spring actions come as part of the newly launched #DebtFreeUNC campaign, which is aimed at pressuring the state government to take action that will ensure that by 2020, the state’s students can be guaranteed to graduate without the need to take out student loans to finance their education.

The actions and the campaign are being organized by the North Carolina Student Power Union (NC SPU), a student-run organization dedicated to “building a grassroots, statewide student movement to stop attacks on public education and all forms of oppression in our communities.”

The group is one of many other growing statewide student organizations advancing the belief that education is a right for all – rather than a privilege for the few – that should uplift and empower people of all kinds, and that schools should be democratically driven by those who work and study in them rather than a top-heavy class of administrators.

NC SPU has tapped into the outrage that students across the state and, indeed, the nation are feeling as they watch austerity budgets and neoliberal policies decimate education budgets, public services, and environmental protections while huge corporations and wealthy get tax breaks and Wall Street continues to rake in massive profits.

The conservative state is already seeing a popular uprising in the Moral Mondays movement, which NC SPU has already aligned itself with, and the group has positioned itself to harness and channel some of that outrage.

The launch of the #DebtFreeUNC campaign is reflective of the broader fight across the nation that young people have been bringing to the banks and government institutions that prop up and profit from the indebtedness of the Millennial generation.

To better understand the North Carolina struggle and where it is going, NC SPU organizer and UNC Charlotte sophomore Casey Aldridge spoke with Popular Resistance about the group and its work.

What is the NC SPU? How did it start and how broad is student involvement in it?

Casey Aldridge: The North Carolina Student Power Union was formed in 2012 out of what was previously known as the NC Defend Education Coalition.  The Defend Education Coalition came together around tuition hikes by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors in 2011 to fight against cuts to higher education.

Despite successes in their campaigns, organizers of the Defend Education Coalition wanted to build a group that could sustain momentum and perpetually build and organize students for higher-quality, more accessible colleges and universities.

The NC Student Power Union was built to address these challenges in organizing and to provide a vehicle for all students and university faculty to more effectively and comprehensively fight academic austerity.  

The original group had chapters at UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Greensboro, and NC State University, and just this spring we’ve formed a strong chapter at UNC Charlotte and are working with students on a number of other publicly-operated campuses to get a handful of other chapters operating in the next academic year – specifically smaller state colleges and North Carolina’s HBCUs, both of which are under greater risk of budget attacks.

As for student involvement, our core organizers consist of anywhere from five to seven students on the campuses we’re active on, and another handful around the state not affiliated with any particular chapter. 

Our support networks on campuses is large and expanding rapidly, however, in this economy and academic environment, time is a luxury that fewer and fewer students have each year, and it takes serious time commitment to organize on campuses.

So while only a handful of students are able to do active organizing, it isn’t out-of-place to see students walking around North Carolina campuses wearing red squares pinned to their shirt, or stopping to sign the petition for a Debt-Free UNC system.  

We’re seeing serious momentum in our campaign, our meetings are growing, and we’ve been able to develop large solidarity networks with organizations, students, and even media contacts that we have really positive relationships with.

That’s what we have been and are.  

Looking forward, we want to provide a serious route to student unionization, and potentially a force by which to replace or to infiltrate the Association of Student Governments in North Carolina.  But we’re trying currently to balance a growing roster of volunteers and organizers with continuing to be a radicalizing space for students.

The final statement in our Principles of Unity denounces “racism, sexism, hetero-sexism and all forms of oppression” on our campuses, as we believe it doesn’t matter what college costs or what is offered at our universities if they remain exclusive and oppressive institutions to different communities of students.  We know our work has to be inter-sectional, and for that, it must be radical.

I think if you had to sum up the North Carolina Student Power Union it would be that we seek to build and provide a radical organized voice for students who oppose cuts to higher education and institutional oppression on our campuses.

What are you hoping to accomplish with the Debt Free UNC campaign?

CA: Much of the NC Student Power Union’s work in the past has been around rejecting proposed tuition hikes or rejecting proposed cuts to faculty pay and academic departments.  And sometimes we’ve been successful on those fronts, with strong student demonstrations, deliberate civil disobedience, and pressure from the public on the Board of Governors and North Carolina General Assembly.  

Other times, however, our efforts were disregarded, or we’d have to make concessions at the negotiating table – that is, bargaining for fewer cuts or less fee hikes, as opposed to our demands of no cuts and no fee hikes.

So at our January 2014 Organizing Retreat, we decided we wanted to switch tactics and demand something big.  

We looked at a program called the “Carolina Covenant” at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a program where the school promises that, if you qualify and attend UNC Chapel Hill, you will graduate without any debt, and they work with the student and their individual ability to pay to make that covenant a reality.  

Unfortunately, most students don’t receive any such guarantee, and loans are the only option for financing education.  We want to ensure that if any student decides to attend a public university or college in North Carolina, they should be extended the promise that the Carolina Covenant guarantees.  

No student should go in debt to receive an education from any one of the University of North Carolina’s sixteen campuses.

The #DebtFreeUNC campaign was conceived at that retreat, and launched a few short months later, with three demands addressed to the University of North Carolina Board of Governors. We are calling for:

Reduced tuition and increased financial aid incrementally so that, by 2020, the incoming class of all North Carolina public universities will graduate free of student debt;
A moratorium on cuts in faculty pay and funding for departments, especially those cut in recent budgets in order to ensure that the funding for these tuition cuts do not compromise the quality of our public universities;
Forums open to students, faculty, staff, and community members at every Board of Governors meeting so as to include the voices of those who make the university run in decisions about our shared future.
This campaign, instead of saying no to cuts again and again, is an alternative proposal, crafted and put forward by students, demanding what we want.  

The #DebtFreeUNC campaign calls for a different trajectory of funding for higher education altogether, which we feel is critical because in the simple writing of these demands, we have been able to put the political establishment and Board of Governors in North Carolina on the offensive.  

Governor McCrory just released his budget proposal, which would cut $50 million from the UNC system’s allotted funds for the next fiscal year.  The Board of Governors, meanwhile, has engaged in plans to increase tuition yet again, targeted specifically at out-of-state students.

The #DebtFreeUNC campaign does not distinguish between in-state and out-of-state students, especially because by North Carolina law, “out-of-state” also includes undocumented students who have lived most of their lives in North Carolina.  

By setting our sights on a Debt-Free UNC system and an end to all cuts to higher education, we are signaling that not only do we oppose the current budget cuts of the state government and Board of Governors, but we are advocating for movement in the opposite direction:  lower tuition, debt-free education, and restored funding for courses and faculty...

The university isn't necessarily broke since it gets regular funding from the state at the same time every year, however that leaves things in a precarious position if they ""run out of cash"" early (I'm pretty sure most places just go into more debt if this was the case).

The bigger problem is figuring out how to put the university back in the green, since that generally necessitates a major overhaul across nearly every academic and non-academic department (pay cuts distributed where those at the top take a slightly higher percentage cut and those at the bottom take fairly low percentage cuts, streamlining purchasing and accountability, doing more fundraising, doing even more fundraising, and doing more fundraising [because tuition hikes due to irresponsible financing would be horrid]).

An unweighted grade would mean that all assignments carry an equal proportion of the final grade.

bnwv2s,Appeal Critique,"Hi everyone. I messed up and got dismissed from my program at University. I need help with my appeal and would appreciate if people could provide some input on mine. Thank you!!

&#x200B;

Dear XXX,

I am writing this letter to appeal my academic dismissal from XXX program. Although I am not surprised by the decision, I am extremely upset to receive the letter of dismissal earlier this week informing me of this news. I am writing this letter with hope that I can still continue my journey in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to this decision. 

&#x200B;

This past year, I admit that I had a very difficult time and my grades have greatly suffered as a result. I went into my second year not knowing about the difficulty of all the classes I was registered in. Looking back, I realized I tried to balance too much this past year. I worked many hours at my job to be able to pay for tuition, rent, and necessities like groceries. The number of hours I worked cut into the time I had to study. I also tried to stay involved in extracurricular activities, such as clubs. Overall, my workload was too much for me to handle. I realize that I should have spoken to more people for support. In regard to balancing my schedule, I understand now that I should have made appointments with CASE more often to discuss how I should balance my schedule. I acknowledge and take full responsibility for what I previously stated, but I am taking all the steps I can in order to achieve the future I want. 

&#x200B;

I have fallen in love with XXX University and all that it has to offer, and it would mean the world to me to be able to continue to pursue my XXX degree. If I am given the opportunity, I will most importantly focus more on my schoolwork, work fewer hours, and manage my time more wisely. In order to improve my academic performance, I anticipate achieving the following:

&#x200B;

1.	Improvement Recognition: I have improved my grades from Fall 2018 by focusing harder and working smarter in Spring 2019. My GPA has increased by 0.203, an 8.9% increase. Given the chance, I surely know that I will be able to achieve this again. I have certainly worked harder in the last portion of the spring semester, and I will attach a conversation I had with Professor XXX that shows my improvement in my work habits. I would continue this academic growth into and throughout my professional years with the use of tutors and more hours dedicated to studying.

&#x200B;

2.	Additional Help/Resources:  I will continue to seek the help from my peer advisors, supervisors, tutors and attend “after hours” sessions. Historically, I have sought the guidance from XXX for Organic Chemistry I. I attended four of her Supplemental Instruction sessions and it helped me tremendously. Specifically, she helped me understand addition reactions, substitution and elimination, and many more concepts. After attending these sessions, I received a higher score on my final exam compared to previous exams. To continue this momentum, I will also seek a tutor for the more challenging classes I will undertake such as Organic Chemistry II.

&#x200B;

In addition, I frequently communicate and visit with my advisor, XXX, and discuss with her how to jumpstart my path to success in the future. I also plan on visiting Dean XXX for advice and guidance. I have recently emailed him to schedule days we can meet and chat about my future success. Since I am a first-generation student, I felt I did not have someone close to help guide me, but taking advantage of using faculty as mentors to assist me has pushed me in the right direction

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3.	Summer Course Enrollment: I will be taking Organic Chemistry II and retaking Medical Microbiology. If I am given the opportunity to take these classes, I will definitely be able to obtain the 2.7 GPA requirement. I have proven my success through summer courses, as last year I was in a similar situation. I wanted to improve my GPA; therefore, I retook Introduction to Psychology. I received a C+ during Spring 2018. When I retook the course during Summer 2018, I received an A which improved my GPA by 0.113, a 4.2% increase.

&#x200B;

In addition, I plan on working during the summer to help save money. This leads me to my payment plan.

&#x200B;

4.	New Tuition Payment Plan: I discussed a more strategic payment plan with my family that will allow me to still afford tuition at XXX while also allowing me to allocate more of my schedule to my schoolwork and less of my schedule to external work. By lifting some of the financial burden from my plate, I can dedicate my time and efforts towards my academic goals.

&#x200B;

Although my grades have not yet shown it, I truly am a good student that had a very difficult year juggling my financial and academic commitments. I hope I will be able to receive the opportunity for a second chance. These years are not just about learning academically, but learning about oneself, and growing as an adult. This experience has helped me see that. Thank you again for considering my appeal, and I sincerely hope to continue the path to my XXX degree with your approval.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

Provide proof of your work schedule, extracurricular activities, and financial hardship(s).  The appeals committee will **want** to see this information.  Proof of a financial hardship could be your ticket to staying in the program. 

>	I understand now that I should have made appointments with CASE more often to discuss how I should balance my schedule. I acknowledge and take full responsibility for what I previously stated, but I am taking all the steps I can in order to achieve the future I want.

Not all committee members will know what “CASE” is if it’s an outside resource from your primary program of study.  You may want to provide future scheduled appointment dates with CASE in your letter. 

>	I have fallen in love with XXX University and all that it has to offer, and it would mean the world to me to be able to continue to pursue my XXX degree. If I am given the opportunity, I will most importantly focus more on my schoolwork, work fewer hours, and manage my time more wisely. In order to improve my academic performance, I anticipate achieving the following:

Rephrase this entire paragraph, while omitting “I have fallen in love with [...]”. as it sounds superficial.  

I would begin that entire section by stating: “After careful consideration, I have made the following lifestyle changes, not only to improve my academic performance in the Doctor of Pharmacy Program at [Name of Institution], but to also promote my overall success in completing my graduate degree program within a reasonable timeframe.  In order to accomplish my immediate and long-term goals, I have applied the following:”

Bullet #1: Change

Bullet #2: Change
         *Evidence*

Bullet #3: Change
        *Evidence* 

Bullet #4: Change
         *Evidence*



Plug the following into the bullets above and rephrase for clarity.  You will want to show some type of evidence to these current and planned changes.  



>	1. Improvement Recognition: I have improved my grades from Fall 2018 by focusing harder and working smarter in Spring 2019. My GPA has increased by 0.203, an 8.9% increase. **Good job!

**But your grades did show improvement as you previously state!**

The letter of appeal should be written as a formal letter addressing the “Appeals Committee” etc.  You’re using a more informal tone throughout your entire letter, which may not weigh in your favor as you are at the graduate-level and in a professional program.  

Although, you establish a clear argument as to what circumstances have caused your drop in academic performance, it is not quite evident to the reader that you have thoughtfully established changes to your current study habits, work/school schedule, and finances.  This could be due to the choice of language and/or wording throughout.  *The lack of providing relevant proof to the claims you make will play a role in the appeal committee denying your letter.*

I would take the extra initiative by having your schools writing center read over this letter for you as well.  It is an important letter and should be written flawlessly, after all you have made it this far in the graduate program, why not go that extra step?

I hope this was somewhat helpful— good luck! ",2019-05-13 09:26:01

""The crucial piece that is missing, IMO, is the need for recognition of advising by HE administrators and for WHAT advising is (and is not, such as schedule-building). Automattic and other tech companies have the data from customer management analyses to know that ""happiness engineers"" affect not only the bottom line but how customers and employees feel about the company and its products. Your article assumes that HE administrators understand effective advising (i.e., proactive, developmental or teaching-oriented advising) when that is still a question at some institutions. If we could cross that bridge with central administration on a real scale, we would be further along the forward-thinking path you outline in your creative post. We need advisors and administrators to implement effective advising (by seeing themselves as more than schedulers) and we need them to ""manage up"" and communicate broadly across campus about their effect on student success. (We need the research that supports their effect as well.) With the research and the effective practice, who knows how we might grow and develop in the future?"" ",2014-10-14 22:20:38
