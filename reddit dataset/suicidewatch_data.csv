0,c34ko8,False,None,188,My girlfriend killed herself a week after we broke up,SuicideWatch,"Hello. I don't really know how to start this. I guess I'll tell you how I met my ex.

Roughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her ""previous life"" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.

Things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.

After a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn't let her. The drinking got worse. I'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.

One night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn't give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn't hear my music. I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don't want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.

I tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. 

One week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. How it had been the last straw.

I feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. It's never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I've been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can't.

Thanks for reading to the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c34ko8/my_girlfriend_killed_herself_a_week_after_we/,3222,"IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, you had a very stressful job, your drinking problome was hard to stop, you didn't know that it would happen, none of this is your fault, wierd thing happen when we are drunk, stuff we don't want to happen, but sometimes we need to get drunk because we can't bare reality, at least you kept your job, it was either getting drunk and keeping your job, or being without a job and causing more trouble, you just did what you had to do for the better of your son and girlfriend ",2019-06-21 01:54:11
1,e8gjky,False,None,364,Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.,SuicideWatch," 

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e8gjky/raped_in_front_of_my_girlfriend_feeling_like/,2800,[removed] ,2019-12-09 21:41:43

11,ceryei,False,None,104,"I am never ""suicidal enough"" to be heard. I am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly ""too"" everything to be worthy of any support.",SuicideWatch,"And I am gradually withering away because of it.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ceryei/i_am_never_suicidal_enough_to_be_heard_i_am_too/,1825,"Yup. I had one doctor tell me that it was normal for students to feel ""a bit down"" and a counsellor tell me that I wasn't depressed enough to consider pills but I was doing everything she'd normally recommend to help.

I'd gotten to a point where I knew if I didn't get help soon I'd end up killing myself, so went to see a new GP. He was lovely, immediately diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety, and now I'm feeling better than I have in years after a round of CBT and 3 months on antidepressants.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline.

In my experience, they don't seem to think about much in this regard other than their own emotions. 

Also, people operate differently. Even those that don't necessarily want attention and are serious about their ideation, will tell people.

Newsflash: IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.",SuicideWatch,"Every conversation I have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following:

""Have you considered listening to music?""

""Have you considered going for a walk?""

""Have you considered taking up a new hobby?""

""Have you considered making new friends?""

""Have you considered volunteering/getting a job?""

It happens every time. It happens in every conversation. It happened yesterday, and it happened twenty minutes ago. I finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because I just can't call one, and this is the only ""help"" I received.

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

My plan was to do it as soon as I got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and I wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. 
I opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when I opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. It was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits.

32,g2jkre,False,None,107,I just saw a post asking “If you committed suicide a year ago what beautiful things would you have missed?”. I can’t think of a single thing.,SuicideWatch,"When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, the relationship felt off from right when it happened. I don’t have the heart to tell him because I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed again (shooting heroin and popping benzos). It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. I’ve been wanting to break up with him but now he’s in a bad place and I feel stuck. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 4 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year he has ever not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

• • • • •

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. 

I’m so, so tired.

I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them.

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

40,g3sz2y,False,None,64,I’m a Nurse who killed people,SuicideWatch,"I can’t shake the guilt. I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe.

41,dub69m,False,None,89,"3 days ago was my birthday, I should’ve done it but my dog and a redditor saved my life",SuicideWatch,"3 days ago was my birthday. I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.

the reason maybe why they are scared of mentally ill people is becuase if you are willing to hurt yourself, you are willing to hurt women and children.

surely your parents are selling their house so they can pay for the bill? or are they not taking their responsibility as parents seriously just becuase you aren't a cute baby anymore?

also what was the bridge under? were there people below it?

your parents thought it was a good idea to have you so really you need to sit them down and talk to them about it whether its awkward or not. you are a victim of your parents not the system. the system didn't have a say in you being born.

also i should add that you could train to be a doctor  and provide free healthcare for some people. even though it does seem like a hefty bill and i do feel for you surely your parents would not have had you without savings? if so then maybe get a loan from the bank

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.

And you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells, treat you like you're a kicked puppy.  And the guilt is worse than that before. Because you caused that and they won't admit it to you. The guilt is soul destroying. And then there's you. Your stomach can't handle anything but water and plain bread. The sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet. The shaking for no reason- entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment. Sleep? No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so. And that's if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place. Oh. And when you finally think your body has recovered? Its worse. You cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit. Like youre peeing out of your ass.

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one.

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when.

I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife.

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I will have to take at least three semesters at my new school to finish my bachelor’s degree.  This new school is shitty and not a good school but it’s the only one I could get in to.  I was supposed to graduate next month but since my parents refused to sign a loan for my last semester I had to drop out of the really good school I was going to.  Now since I’ll have to take so many semesters to finish the costs will balance out anyway and so now I’m wasting more time and the same amount of money for a shittier degree.  I don’t want to graduate when I’m 24, I wanted to graduate at 21 like I was supposed to and not waste 6+ years of my life in college.  I don’t even want to be doing what I’m majoring in.  I already owe 150k in loans that I’ll never pay off.  I’m going to be stuck in a shitty job (if I can even find a job after all this corona shit) for the rest of my life.  I don’t see myself being able to move out of my mom’s house before I graduate since I can’t get a high enough paying job without a degree.  I cannot stay here in the middle of fucking nowhere in this abusive household for 2 more years.  My dreams of going to Korea are over because I won’t be able to find a high enough paying job there to afford living and my school loan payments.  I envisioned myself living in Korea/NYC by the time I graduated which was supposed to be in two months; now I might have to wait two more years.  I cannot wait that long.  And the only thing I wanted to do, which was pursue my love of music/singing/making Youtube videos, is not an option because of how much I'll have to work to pay off the loans; how my family doesn't let me record shit in the house because I'm ""too loud"" even though they're always screaming at each other; how I'm not even a good enough singer to do anything and I'm not in a financial position or location to get lessons/learn from anyone.

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more.

We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster.

It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm.

A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did.

My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend.

I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone.

I am not sure why I am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why I took my life on a day I was supposed to be happy.

Here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. I grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as I was. I also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. Growing up, I would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever I did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.

112,gcb0sp,False,None,83,"I spent 3 yrs writing this horror book, making a soundtrack for it, and making it viewable like a film. I put my heart into something that will go nowhere. I just want to fucking die. I’ve been made unemployed bc of coronavirus. I’m so stressed",SuicideWatch,"I put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer. So many hours spent at university studying and practicing. I would honestly stay at the library until it would close at 2 am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at 6 am. I won the praises of my professors, taking honors classes, being told I will go far. All for a Creative Writing degree that I can't do anything with. But It's been my dream since I was 11 and read Harry Potter to be a writer. I'm 29 now. That dream turned into a nightmare.


I've thought a lot about form and what a book could be. I felt literature has to be updated. Because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours. So I made a soundtrack for this book I wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and I made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it. 


And now what? Post it to reddit? Hope it will go viral by spamming it? All that will do is get trolls to spit on something I spent so much time and energy on. Go to a publisher? So they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people? And to get a publishing deal, it would take months. And before I could a publishing deal, I would need to get a literary agent, which also would take months. And then, it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves. And then, on top of all this, to add insult to injury, I, the writer, would make very little. The profits, if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent. This is because I would just be starting out. I'm not a veteran established writer like Murakami or Rushdie. They can get better deals. Me though? I would have to wait 3 years and see very little in return. 


I have it all already prepared though and available right now. I just can't reach an audience. I don't know how to. In my mid-20s I had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity. Precisely because I did post on reddit. A lot of people seemed to like what I was doing. But, it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because I was posting something I made. Like it's the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something I put a lot of work into. It's not like I was making hundreds of posts. Any post I would make where I would say: ""I made this"" it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldn't even take the time to read what I wrote or listen to the poem I would read - they would hate my post, just because I posted about something I made. I mean they treated it like I was forcing my work down their throats, but am I forcing my work on people by making a post about it? You don't have to click. It's just a post and I would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who I haven't reached yet might like what I do. Is that really so terrible? I don't understand why people treat it like it's the worst thing in the world and like it's so aggravating and annoying. Companies can have advertisements, but me, a single person, trying to do something on my own, it's not called advertisement, it's called ""spam"" instead. It was so frustrating. I didn't become famous, I'm not saying this, but I did get attention eventually and I did grow in popularity. Precisely because I did post to reddit and stopped saying ""I made this"" to ""I found this."" Instantly got more recognition. One night while I was drunk I deleted everything I made and my entire online presence, because I was so frustrated by this. 1,700 subscribers on youtube, videos with tens of thousands of views. All gone. I could try posting my things on reddit again, but oh my fucking God there is no way I'm doing that a second time. It was a nightmare to get that far, I'm not making that mistake a second time (except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and I hope people'd be a bit more tolerant and to provide context here's what I wasted 3 fucking years of my life on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLcoexhuMI)

What else can I do? Write like Rupi fucking Kaur and shit all over instagram like all these ""instapoets""? Just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures, I could get fame for that. It'd be very easy. But I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I accomplished. Suicide I guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless. If you don't whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure.


I lost my job because of the coronavirus. I can't bring myself to get unemployment. I have never been on government assistance. I feel weird even getting this $1,200 check. I grew up in a libertarian/objectivist household. I can't get something for free, I can only be ok with myself if everything I have I worked for. I always told myself I would die before being in this position. I try to have integrity and pride. This is just humiliating. And it was humiliating working at my previous job. Knowing I could have capable of so much more, knowing I could have done so much more with my life, that at one point I honestly had fans - even my very own creeps like one who drove hundreds of miles just to meet me!

You are a very strong person and you will recover with time.
But despite all of that, she is still your mother, a human being and the person who gave you life. 
Saving the hate for her only will torture you and her for the rest of your lifes.
She is damaged probably, just like you. I'm not saying she is a good person or anything that she did to you was right, but you gotta empathize with her a little bit, not because she is your mother, but because she is a human. 
The things she is doing to recover you (sending anime stuff), just shows that she knows she did wrong and she misses you.
Forgiveness is precious gift you give someone not because they deserve it but because you understand the pain better than anyone.
I know this is going to have a lot of down votes, because everyone just wants to pay hate with hate and sin with sin, but that is the destructive behavior that will slowly kill you inside.
I hope you can once talk with her, tell her sorry for your words, and that you forgive her for the things she did to you in the pass, and then leave and live your life in peaceful way with no guilty.

119,gq7agw,False,None,130,My despicable legacy,SuicideWatch,"Today, as 25th may I've decided to kill myself. Not sure if it's because I've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because I finally understand things I didn't before. I do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things I've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

I feel invisible. 

I've been invisible my whole life. While never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
I feel alone, even when I'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something I've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

At first, I was born as an accident, I've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
I was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. I lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until I was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
From 0 to 4 life was decently good, I don't personally recall any bad experiences, but I was told recently from my grandmother that I would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. I don't know why. 
My dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. He was present, to be fair, he was more present when I couldn't remember. 

From 5 to 12 I lived in the flat I mentioned early. I was there alone most of the day. Now I think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? Well, one that clearly didn't care enough. At 6 I joined school, the same monotous hell I assisted for 12 years. I never really fitted with the average person. I wasn't an outcast, or a creep, I had friends. They weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. We would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
I never did good in school, I barely did decent. Parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. Luckily my mother and dad broke up when I was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
My father never, ever hit me. He was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
Nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which I completely regret. 

At the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? Some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. I didn't understand it. I had no idea why it was happening. Suddenly, the world was no more love painted. A great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. To see everyone as an enemy. Years later I understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness I feel every day; that was the starting point. 
At 12, I cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. I enjoyed it to some degree. I never did it to a serious level, and I stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. Months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
I forgot to mention that I've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. So a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

At this point I'm a bit drunk. Getting everything ready for my departure, as I listen to There's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

Sadly I never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. I never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. I've always been by my own, I've always been alone. What saddens me the most, is that I've never been heard. I've always been ignored.

Invisible. That's what I've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

Everyone around me gets talked by others. Others interact with others, but not me. 
It covers many aspects, not only been talked but... I don't know how to explain it. I am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes I believe I'm really invisible? 
Sometimes I talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
Philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet I cannot answer myself. If I'm ignored like that, am I even there? Was I part of a community? 

But this is about the good things I did, too. 
I joined the fire brigade. Had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, I helped men, women and children. Tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness I felt. 

I also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! I called her Mamou, she had 4 little kitties which I gifted to people I knew who would take good care of them. 

But it's been 2 years since I've been living on my own, Mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. But overall, made something a bit more clear for me. It wasn't hatred what I felt for the world, but disappointment. We've come so far as a species. We have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself I am guilty of this. I haven't done anything remarkable. 
I am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

For those reasons I am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? I am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. I mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

That leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. That's what some of my friends did to me. They ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
Sure, I did a mistake, I admit it. I did many mistakes. But looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, I never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

Quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances I had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. Tho it hasn't been all bad, I got fit. I lost a lot of weight. I've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

Anyway, to the last point. The things I most regret in life? Probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
I regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

If you made it this far, I cannot properly explain how much I appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. This is more attention than all the one I've been given through my whole life. It felt really good to open up after so long

I am Tomás Renard, these are the last words I want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. If anyone is concerned, know I will leave happy that at least read this post. I will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeño wine",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gq7agw/my_despicable_legacy/,784,"after i read this i got sad because you seem like a pretty cool guy, Tomás, but then once i went through the comments I saw that you've decided to live. That made me quite happy for some reason, idk. But all I can say to you is talk to your friends about this, strangers on the internet can and will help you, but then they probably won't be as helpful as people you know irl (at least in my experience). Maybe just strike up a conversation about mental health or start off a conversation with a ""hey, can I talk to you about something sensitive?"". This might help open up to them or help them understand. Then again, this won't work for all of your friends but I'm pretty sure you know which ones to talk to.

Maybe I’m just overreacting, since what I’m scared of is what pretty much everyone goes through. But I really don’t want responsibility. I hate that the more I age, the more people expect of me. I don’t want to turn 18 and suddenly be an adult, thrown out to the world. There’s so much that will have to be done in my life and I can’t handle it. 

Getting into university, getting a job, a drivers licence, hell even just the idea of having to get groceries... it all scares me. I feel like everything is happening too fast.

121,cwio6u,False,None,45,"My name is Tyler, that’s my real name this is my only account, I’m highly suicidal, have been since I was about 6-7 years old, I’m 26 now and it’s different now. I’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. Thanks for reading if you do <3",SuicideWatch,"
Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death.

123,81zuxe,False,None,88,Attempt failed. Currently in the hospital.,SuicideWatch,"I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. 

Stay strong and reconsider your choice.

For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR.

Then I called the hotline cause I needed someone to talk to. I thought it would be like free therapy. Boy was I wrong. Told them what happened, even gave them a fake name and location but the person on the other line deemed that I was a risk to myself. They got the info by pulling up the provider from the phone I was calling from and going to the address listed. Since I moved out, they actually ended up at my parents house while my brother was home and tried to find me there. My heart sank when my brother called me cause I pretty much SWAT'd him just then. The popo called me and I told them my address, they left my brother alone and two paramedics with two officers came to my unit after. They told me I needed to come with them and they would bring me by force if necessary.
Now for context; my mountain of debt, a car accident, and getting fired from several jobs in a row without any potential future prospects all led me to a suicidal state of mind that day. When the ambulance pulled up my heart sank again cause guess what? I have zero insurance.

I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. 

Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. 

I've been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down. Some nights I think about how if I haven't sought help from the hotline that day I might be better off than I am today. Maybe alive or dead, but probably better off either way.

148,95icab,False,None,52,nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide,SuicideWatch,"I often fantasize about dying. I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or ""choosing"" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/95icab/nobody_cares_if_youre_suicidal_until_you_actually/,718,"I know the emo scene ist kind of controversial because of the look and kind of a prejudice that comes with it.

149,fvd2oi,False,None,70,I tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows,SuicideWatch,"January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important?

&#x200B;

I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.

&#x200B;

I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.

It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged.

&#x200B;

So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of ""suicide watch"", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world?

Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's ""better"" to live. Even if that means living in misery.

&#x200B;

It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I?

I dunno.

&#x200B;

I opened this with the intent on explaining why I feel suicidal. *My* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). But I've been repeating myself as it is online and offline.

&#x200B;

If someone *is* reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out.

If someone is reading this; I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to hold this off anymore. So I'll just imagine that I'm not alone. That maybe this message connects us.

I'll just pretend that someone is reading this. So, just in case I can't hold on, I won't be alone in the end.

171,bgq09m,False,None,53,I jumped off a (small) bridge,SuicideWatch,"Surprise! I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

174,c9hfw3,False,None,72,Why is it so hard for some people to accept that life just isn't that great for some people?,SuicideWatch,"Some people just get completely, utterly screwed, traumatized and limited by life, to the point that living just isn't enjoyable anymore. To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9rq2jd/i_killed_my_girlfriend_and_now_i_want_to_kill/,641,[removed] ,2018-10-27 00:19:01
199,g7szm1,False,None,41,I don’t want to live without him,SuicideWatch,It’s been 8 years since my fiancé was murdered in a robbery gone bad and I wish I could say I’m better but I’m not. I’ve hated my life every moment of every day since he left. I hate this world for taking him from me over something so stupid. I was born to a family that doesn’t love me and everyone has treated me like shit except him and now I have to live the rest of my miserable life without him. I’ve prayed for the courage to end it all. I’ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse. The worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but I don’t want anyone else. The thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick. I’m not over my fiancé and I never will be. I think I was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress. I don’t want to live with this pain anymore. I’m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again. I will never marry or have a family. I will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren. My life is a waste and means nothing.

200,fvvuxo,False,None,83,Please read this if you have the time.,SuicideWatch,"I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore.

202,g7ijp1,False,None,41,the amount of people suffering here is insane,SuicideWatch,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor

Think there might be a lil misunderstanding here. Life IS a complete fucking joke, but life does matter, there are just things that make individual lives and things matter more/less than others. Like if you’re a parent and love and care about your child. That child’s life matters more. Or if you’re a teacher. Whatever can made an impact, especially in a positive way, matters. The heart and brain matter, without them 👋 Being healthy matters. Air matters. 

Life mattering isn’t the same as existence itself having a good or bad meaning or suffering being worth it. Idk if existence itself has meaning, but I know the existence of suffering and everything bad is unnecessary. 

Anyways, point is there are things in life that have meaning, so life has meaning. Technically. I know it’s not really what people are usually referring to by meaning/purpose but at least that’s something, right? ",2020-06-08 05:26:35

221,f2o37x,False,None,39,I want to kill myself. I want to die. NSFW,SuicideWatch,"**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me.

I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything.

When you label yourself as sad, depressed, angry, how could you be anything but these? You have to think positively and I cannot stress how important that is, yes it’s a process and it takes time and practice to change your mindset to that of a positive one but it’s possible. Practice meditation and try to be more aware of your thoughts at all times, when you notice a negative thought replace it with a positive or notice the good things that are happening at the moment. 

Realize that the very fact that you are conscious is a blessing, if you practice enough you can turn off your mind and simply sit in the present moment. When you feel bad, sit down in a comfortable position, breathe deep, let go of thoughts, and let your feelings take you over. Just let it happen. Everyday you wake up is a blessing and everything that happens is happening exactly how it should happen. Other than that, treat your body well too. Don’t use any intoxicants, exercise, limit/ quit sugar, take cold showers, quit masturbation. I truly wish you the best and I know you will get better.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t.

242,7jypro,False,None,63,"Best friend killed himself, I want to join him",SuicideWatch,"My best friend killed himself at the end of September, and I still can't handle it. I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

He was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.

I called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

I've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.

I failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

I can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.

I just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.

Shane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.

It’s been a rough life, i cant finish highschool, my anxiety for testing for HIV is sky rocket, and I feel like a failure. Nothing in my life is going my way and I’m only 18. I havent been taking my meds (stupid i know) so i constantly worry about everything, and my suicidal thoughts are through the roof. 

I was sexually assaulted in June, he did put a condom on but that doesnt help or ease my pain and take away the fact that someone I trusted enough took advantage of my body and raped me.

I’m more suicidal than ever, my anxiety is off the roof and I’m scared to have sex again because I’m afraid that my rapist gave me HIV. I will never live with myself and I can’t tell my friends or the boy I’m talking to. I have nobody, no support and I’m afraid to go get tested on Saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done.  If the test results come out positive, it’s the end for me bc nobody will love me and I’m just a dirty worthless piece of shit. I wish i never existed. And I’m in so much agony and pain and stress, my (then clear) face is breaking out and making me feel even worse.

I don’t know what to do and I’m scared and i feel hopeless. I feel like death is my only way out.

UPDATE 9/6/19: So today I found out he has a girlfriend who he got pregnant. And he already has a kid. So he has two kids now. My anxiety is a little calm now because I’m sure if he had HIV they would have it and so would their kid and knowing his babymother, she would have him in court and tell the whole school about how dirty he is. But it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences. I could’ve been that pregnant girl. I hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable STD. But that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now I don’t love it anymore. I’m still disgusted by my body now and I feel dirty ashamed.

I wish this would all end. I think I might kill myself soon. I can’t focus on life rn when all of this is happening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d02wvf/if_i_test_positive_im_going_to_kill_myself/,588,Shoot then ,2019-09-05 16:15:32

I'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so I don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. I'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. I won't think about tomorrow, how I'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. I won't wonder if I'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. 

While your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, I'll turn on the TV because the silence kills me. 

It's not that I resent that you have people. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I wish I didn't go back to an empty house all the time, I wish there was someone to say ""welcome home"". I wish that it isn't just Google for me to talk to at home. 

When I'm sick, I become so vulnerable. Broken body, broken spirit. The loneliness eats up at me even more and I wish I could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. Let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. Watch as the pain flows out of my veins.

I want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. Feel myself sway in the wind till I find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. Feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as I become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. The wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. 

I want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. To feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. The demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions.

Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal.

So I'm not exactly the happiest person in the world, but I wanted to tell you I understand. And also share a story that perhaps resonates with you a bit.

I was an outcast most of my teenage years - no friends, no boyfriend, always at home in my computer. And I always dreamed of the things you write. I recall thinking ""I'll never take a summer trip with friends because I have none"".

Three years later, I started college. Formed a nice group, we were friends for a while. And we took a summer trip together. It felt so nice, even if we didn't remain friends. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is gjve yourself a chance. You are capable of making friends. Perhaps in a different environment, you can feel at ease enough to form bonds with other people. I know that you are capable of being a friend, and someone out there would appreciate you.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dem5tu/i_got_a_gun_to_kill_myself_and_my_parents_found/,542,"Hey!!! You're loved!!! Period. You have purpose even if you don't see it
You're on suicide watch because our Lord straight up said.... NOPE!!! NOT leaving. Not your time.
Yea suck it up, but no guilt trip here. It's about finding yourself, seeing your gifts, your abilities, and trusting on your light that there IS benefit for your life, your living!!!

Try different meds ones that don't have the same side affects and WHILE on your meds please feed yourself, exercise, try not to abuse yourself by controlling what you ""feel"" you have control over.  Binging and purging.

Find a different therapist sometimes it take YEARS to find one you can connect with, God willing you don't have to wait so long. Find a trauma therapist, stick with your psychiatrist, see an internal med doc, try some cognitive behavioral health sessions, or eating disorder groups, or self help groups. 

READ. Read other's stories and struggles and how they over came them. Pick it apart, choose what servers you, let go of what doesn't. 

The ""guilt""trip is nothing more than individuals who have no other resources available to them. They're digging at the bottom of the barrel because that what was ingrained in them growing up. Some people run on pain and turn things around other's they simply barrel diem the freaking worm hole of abuse. 

If you get anything out of my response get this, 

YOU are worthy of a happy life, you deserve to be free of the pains that still haunt you, you deserve to let go.... let go of what does NOT serve you. You deserve to see and feel the beauty of life and the GIFT it truly is. 

Please rethink your plans. Rethink who's controlling you. You ARE NOT a puppet so cut the strings that hold you and torment you. Walk free flick the dust off your shoulder, pull yourself up by your boot straps, remind yourself YOU GOT THIS, you were NOT an accident. 

You are purposely made with great strength, deep love, understanding, and the ability to pull out of the trenches, because you SEE... heal yourself first, while healing other's, main focus is you otherwise you're no good for anyone else. 

""Man up"" means morning more than,  SEE YOURSELF, your future. Your happiness basking in the glory of the light above. 

Don't make a snap decision, for a temporary situation. YOU and you alone have control on which path you take, how much you want to suffer, whether or not you stand still and put the ""record on skip"". There's no reasons to continue to abuse. Break free my friend. You obviously have the power to do so. So now use that energy for good not for destruction. 

The dark forces, energies, low level frequencies thrive off that bullshit. Tell them to fuck off and go get what YOU know you deserve. 

Here's a hint..... It's NOT suffering. Contact me anytime. I would love to go through this journey with you as a support. 

Remember not all give give all hence why it takes a village to raise a child, a teen  am adult, and the elderly. Stick together, shoulder to shoulder and remember everyone has a level I  which they are capable of when it comes to support, love, understanding, and compassion. It does not make them inadequate. It makes them what you need, because REMEMBER it takes a village. 

Please continue to seek your life, your understanding, healing, appreciation, acceptance, forgiveness, and most importantly the belief that you are created for more.

Misery was not ""really""in the agenda. 

What does NOT serve you, let go!!

284,8r97s7,False,None,71,I was born a hermaphrodite and I want to die because of it.,SuicideWatch,"I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.

I am here if you ever need anyone to talk to.

I’m so sorry that your parents did that. That’s mental abuse and they don’t deserve a child period.

There is love for you, don’t worry. Keep an open mind and I promise love will find you.

You’re definitely not unlovable. Your parents are just fucked up in the head. Not you.

It’s funny how people will try and tell you how messed up you are. All they’re doing is projecting their insecurities on you about how their bodies couldn’t produce a “normal” child.

Sex is a spectrum and varies from person to person.

You’re not a hermaphrodite, your intersex like many people. It’s not uncommon.

I was male my whole life but when I hit 17 I grew breasts. Everything else is male about me. I used to be really self conscious until I met people who were into that or looked passed it. 

Yeah, I get looks and people talk shit, but it’s because they were taught to be that way. Do the world a favor and teach others about the truth of intersex people and how we’re not trans and we never had a say in our bodies.

That’s like bleaching a black kids skin white as a child because you don’t like black people. Same goes for homophobes.

Which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. Honestly I cant even remember how to multiply or divide, It's humiliating. At that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online 8 hours away.  Around this time I got really depressed & cried everyday for like 6 months. I barely ate & stayed inside my room all day with only a TV connected to a cable box to keep me company. I didn't see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back & took me along with her to this small town that I'm in now. I think I've spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because I've been mentally incapable of anything else. Which means I can't drive, I don't have any friends, family or let alone a job.

299,bodzsr,False,None,120,Therapy was the worst thing that happened to me,SuicideWatch,"A few years ago when I was suicidal I was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible.

I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  


The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.

My sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. Her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

I have a  decent salary, friends I speak to regularly, I get along with everybody  at work. I do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

If  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that I've been  diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. I've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.

I am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.

319,eax3lg,False,None,50,I want to commit suicide on Xmas Eve just like my sibling,SuicideWatch,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

BIG UPDATE: ASKED HER OUT SHE SAID SHE LIKED ME TOO BUT WE UNDER QUARANTINE LMAO",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fj5nq9/i_really_just_wish_someone_gave_a_fuck_about_me/,505,"You can’t be happy with someone else unless you are happy with yourself. 

If you hope that other people will make you happy, you’ve put your happiness into very risky hands. Other people will sooner make you miserable than happy, when you put your happiness in their hands.

You may assume, for example, that you will be happy when you fall in love with the right person. Someone who will really love you back and understand you to the bone. And then it happens. And you’re happy all the way up to the first fight. Or the first time your love is in a bad mood. Or they flirt with someone else. Or whatever. Then everything collapses. And you’re unhappy again.

Neither a perfect lover nor a perfect boss can make you happy. Or a new friend. Or an alien. Other people will sooner make you miserable than happy. Many unintentionally and many on purpose. Because they are just humans like you are. Much like you make others’ lives tougher if you’re unhappy. Why? Because people have to listen to all your bitching, whining and complaining, while deep inside they might hope you’ll make them happy.

I know it kind of sucks. You can’t make other people permanently happy, other people can’t make you a happier person, but they can surely make you unhappy – an abusive partner or parents, a jackass boss or an ignorant friend or whoever you love.

So here is what you should do regarding relationships and happiness:

First of all, you should at all costs avoid people who make your life miserable intentionally or are zombies or energy vampires. And you should surround yourself with happy, encouraging and supportive people who bring out the best in you. While doing that, make sure you aren’t infecting them with your unhappiness.

Then you should expect that even the loveliest people, even the most positive living beings, will hurt you from time to time. So you should always have a center on yourself, and be aware that your happiness shouldn’t depend on other people (we will see how you can achieve that at the end of the blog post).

You can absolutely be in a bad mood when someone disappoints you, but you should also get yourself back in your center after a short while.

Other people can’t make you a happy person, but they can make your life a little bit happier or completely miserable. So don’t put your happiness in the hands of other people, but make sure people aren’t the ones making you unhappy and miserable.

If you cut out of your life all the negative people who drag your happiness level down, it may be a solution to being happier in life. But unfortunately, that’s rarely the case.

You will probably find other things to be unhappy about or attract other assholes in life who will make you unhappy again. The outside world, including your relationships, only mirrors your inner emotional state and processes.

If you’re unhappy, it's very hard to have happy relationships. And if you were a happy person, you would have ditched the negative people in your life a long time ago. To sum up:

Crappy people in your life = May be the reason why you are unhappy in your life
No crappy people in your life = If you are still unhappy. ",2020-03-15 18:13:20

340,f3fnz1,False,None,75,I want to die but afraid of dying!!!,SuicideWatch,"Death. Death. Death. That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death. What will happen to me after committing suicide? I keep asking myself this question whenever I think of suicide. I also ask myself these questions: how will my loved ones react to my death? What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering.

346,fsxvr5,False,None,87,Young doctor (29yo) with suicide thoughts,SuicideWatch,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story.

351,co415i,False,None,56,Suicide is on my mind 24/7 but I know all that I really want is to feel like I’m loved.,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone, my name is Everett. I’m turning 15 soon and I’ve grown up in an abusive religious family. I switched schools last year because I had to take care of my grandparents because they can’t support themselves anymore. My last school I got bullied a lot and people didn’t take me seriously when I talked. I don’t get bullied at my new school but it’s because of other reasons. People started making rumors of me at my new school that I was gonna kill everyone and “shoot up” the school.i don’t know who my real friends are and which ones just don’t want to be the “target” for “when I shoot up the school” because I have Asperger syndrome. I’ve been rejected my whole life to the point where I have no self confidence. My longest relationship ever was 1 month. I want something that’s longer but I feel like no one trusts me. My mother hates me because I constantly fuck up, and I turned out to be a male at birth instead of female. She wanted a girl. My real dad is a drunk bastard and I disconnected ties with him 2 years ago. My step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks I have to follow his religious rules but he doesn’t. He constantly emotionally abuses me when I do things “not holy”. I’ve wanted to run away since I can remember up till about 6th grade when I realized with my state’s laws that I can’t and it would be easier to end myself. So I’ve attempted suicide 5 times since then and I’m such a failure I can’t even kill myself properly. Again, you might say that “I don’t need a girlfriend at my age” but i feel as if that is the only thing I want anymore. I recently got a job and I bought a few things that I thought might help but of course it didn’t. I just want to feel as if I’m loved and I want to turn my sadness into love for them. But of course I can’t have it. I’m doubting what I believe in right now. The only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats. I also think I’m a psychopath. Ive pointed a loaded .22 at my step dad before and if anything I should’ve pulled the fucking trigger. But of course, I’m such a fucking pussy I couldnt even do that properly . People keep telling me it’ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse. Parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted. I constantly build everything up because I don’t want to hurt anyone and I don’t know when it’ll come out. Everyone that I think I might have a chance with pushes me away after I express my feelings to them.it just has gotten to the point I can remember the last time I’ve smiled. I have to wear a mask in front of my parents (emotional mask) because if they found out I wanted to kill myself they would take one of the few things that is keeping me here today because they think video games and texting is all of my problems. I have to wear a mask everywhere I go because someone could report it and my parents would find out. It doesn’t help either that every adult I know doesn’t take me seriously because I’m not an adult.

355,8b4hnr,False,None,45,I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live,SuicideWatch,"Sometimes, I wish I could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can. I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward.

365,e0h3wr,False,None,42,This will get lost in a sea of Suicide notes,SuicideWatch,"I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. 

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e0h3wr/this_will_get_lost_in_a_sea_of_suicide_notes/,478,Awww poor little you lmao ,2019-11-23 12:11:54

I'm done being held hostage by my father, everything about my life controlled like I'm a prisoner. I'm done hearing how gay people deserve to be genocided. I'm done hearing how women deserve to be raped and confined in chains. I'm done being told to do impossible things like rip off the government(?? how) to bring money into a house, money that is supposed to go to a new house but instead gets spent for weed. I'm done hearing him degrade my mother and her just taking it. I'm done with my fucking low-functioning sociopathic half-brother who sets my father off and makes him abuse the rest of us once he loses it, including my poor dog. And of course, my brother gets anything he needs anyways, because he's male and worth more than me.

I've never worked. Never had a boyfriend in real life. Never had a real life friend since I was 11. I graduated high school online a year late with a GPA of 1.7 because he wouldn't let me study. I hurt or ghost everyone I get close to online because he cuts the internet and changes passwords every other day to keep me off so what's the point.

I need to get out. It's either I get out, soon, or I kill myself and hopefully take him with me beforehand, whether it be today or next week or next month. It's been looming for a while now, the urge. The only reason I haven't yet is because I didn't know how until recently, my life is THAT FUCKING CONTROLLED that I couldn't even kill myself. Hell, the fucking kitchen knives are so dull they can't even cut bread, let alone an artery. But I know how now. It came to me tonight, as he rages and calls people like me sick things that deserve to die and throws things and threatens to cut peoples throats. I have the resolve, I have the means. It doesn't even hurt to say it now. In fact, this is the first time I haven't cried all night, because I've accepted it.

I can't drive. No ID or money for a bus. I don't even know where my social security number is. There's no women's shelter, or any shelter, in this piece of shit town he confines us in. Hell, I probably wouldn't make it if there was, I'd be raped or abducted into human trafficking before I got there, that's the kind of place it is. I can't even call the police, no phone and they're known for being wifebeaters and raping girls up on the reservation anyways, they don't care about one girl.

Please, if anyone knows an out. I don't even want to post here, it's probably not the right place, I feel like a lost cause anyways. But I'm trying. I'm trying so fucking hard to hold on. 22 years is a long time to hold on. I'm so tired.

385,ed9ci5,False,None,42,My worst fear has come true and I have already decided that I am going to take my own life,SuicideWatch,"I am a 31 yo gay male who was severely bullied throughout my childhood whilst having to come to terms with my sexuality. Nowadays it’s ok to be gay but when I was growing up it was not. I was surrounded by people both in and out of school that would either physically and mentally torment me and others that would just watch it happen and do nothing to help as if i deserved it. I was very confused and vulnerable at the time so I felt powerless to stop it and just let it happen.

As a result, I developed OCD and body dysmorphia. From that point on I thought the only way people would ever accept me or want to be around me is if I was perfect. I strived for perfection; i was a straight A student, I ate really healthy, I was physically active and I valued my appearance above all else. I could confidently say that I was an attractive guy and I know now I had a lot going for me. Regardless of how hard I tried to be perfect over the years I developed social anxiety and although I had some really good memories, the anxiety plagued most of my young adult life and I missed out on so many good opportunities because of it. Slowly but surely I was able to move past my mental issues and live a somewhat normal life. I had a good job, decent friends and a loving family. 

When I turned 29 I fell in love with this guy who looked like an angel and we were both madly in love. I thought I could finally be happy unconditionally and it would have all been worth it. It wasn’t until we moved in together that I realised he was anything but angelic and that’s when the physical and mental abuse started all over again - Like I was back in high school. He was a sociopath but I didn’t realise until it was too late. He abused me throughout our relationship and slowly tore me down til I was nothing. 

After 2 years of torment I finally got out of the abusive relationship and got a place on my own but that’s when all my unresolved childhood demons came to surface. My body dysmorphia and OCD came back but with extreme vengeance. I dissected everything about my appearance; my hair, my body my skin etc. My hair wasn’t as thick as it was in my early 20s so I went to turkey and got a transplant, whilst I was there I also got Lipo on my stomach even though I know now I didn’t even need it. I came back from Turkey and worked out every day for 12 months until my body was perfect. I was once more trying to become the ultimate version of myself even though there was nothing wrong with me to begin with.

It all took a turn for the worst when I started focusing on my skin. My skin wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t bad. I researched ways to improve it and found something called skin needling that most beauty clinics offered as a way to rejuvenate the skin. I bought a package of 5 sessions at my local clinic and did the full course of 5 spread out a month apart. After the first few sessions I noticed my skin was getting irritated, red and dry. I brought this up with the rep but she assured me this was normal and that it was because my skin was healing. Cut to the last session I got a severe infection and severe inflammation which slowly resulted in my entire face becoming fibrotic and scarred. In the night time you can’t see too much but in the day if you look at my face I look deformed. My entire face has fibrotic scarring that resembles scratch marks as if an angry cat did a number on me. I have seen multiple dermatologists and they can’t help me. This disfigurement is permanent and I look like a monster. 

I have seen multiple psychologists and they are trying to help me try and come to terms with it but I just can’t. One told me that this is my worst fear come true since all the value I put on myself was in my appearance. Every time I look at myself in the mirror I want to die. I feel like if I didn’t have body dysmorphia Which is obviously making the situation so much worse I may have stood a chance. 

I have taken a month off work for the Christmas period and have been staying at my parents because I’m too scared to be alone. For the past month  I have been drinking excessively every day, eating excessively and smoking excessively. Every part of my being has given up on life and I havnt left my room. I have been researching ways to end my life and I feel like this is it for me; after all this struggle with my mental health this is how it’s going to end. My worst fears have come true.

My parents and brother can see what has happened and they sympathise with me but they don’t realise the extent of how much this has really messed me up. I wake up every morning in disbelief this is happening to me. Everyday for the past month I have wished to die and it’s only getting worse every day. My brother told me in confidence he went through his own struggle not too long ago and was planning to hang himself in our storeroom. He showed me the ropes and where he would have tied them. Unbeknown to him this is how I plan to end it.

I desire suicide.",SuicideWatch,"I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems.

It’s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where I am now— to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself. I have no direction. I have no college education, my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless, giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded, at times to perform adequately.

I have a relationship, I suppose I am better for it, but each day I wake up, I feel as though every moment I try to engage with my partner, I bring him down in my depression. It seems only too much, the burden of my love; I feel I’m just too heavy a weight on those around me. 

I have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries, simple things like helping around the house. 

Perhaps my issue is my mental illness I have yet to be diagnosed with, but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort. 

The crushing debt of sadness I get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness I can achieve is simply that— a dream.

It is selfish, but I lose my will to live more and more; I care little about actually dying, it seems the only person I am afraid to hurt is my beloved, but I fear I can’t stay suffering like this much longer, worrying about money, my worth, the pain of simply living. It has been months coming that I have been wasting away.

 Exercise only distracts my heart when I have someone with me, and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins, so much so before we finish the outing.

Calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards, but I try my best to hang on, if only out of love for my fiancé.

I feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now, I am still young, but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind? I can’t enlighten myself to give much more, I feel.

I feel ill every moment of every day.,SuicideWatch,"He was my best friend. I have constant nightmares. We struggled so much after his death - I got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. I battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at Christmas because she missed her Daddy. That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. The rumor went around that her Dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. 

I worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best I could. I found every resource possible for her. But I didn’t take any time for myself I guess. My family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her Dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. My mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. She also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her Dad’s side of her family. She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country. My mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. She can’t handle not having control over my daughter.

IDK.,SuicideWatch,"First of all, I don't know if I need or even want help. Maybe I just want some anonymous people sitting behind computer screens to sympathize with me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now other than venting. My ""life story"" might come out as very very long but its the only way I can express and explain what I'm going through right now. I can't just do a tl;dr for this.

Just to make things clear: My father is an abusive, manipulative, psychopathic, wife-beater, piece of shit. I was/am not abused with the sack of shit, but my mother has been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abused.

Here we go (Some parts obscured):

I was born to international parents, as in they are both different nationalities. Upper middle class to lower upper class. NOT ""rich"" because my father doesn't understand how credit cards, loans, mortgages or saving money works. I've moved plenty of times more than I count on my two hands, living in 4 different countries including birth country. I will refer to them as country 1, 2, 3, 4, in order of moving.

I lived in my birth country(1) for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where I genuinely could smile and have fun. I would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital(fairly small town), we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school. We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.

My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of ""fights"" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in ""trouble"" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.

Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was ""living expenses"" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.

After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \[no offense to overweight people\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).

Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were ""problems with immigration"" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).

I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally ""wrong"" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was ""patrolling"" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was ""popular"") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as ""help""; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.

That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too ""tired"" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was ""fine"" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.

As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.

Like I said, I don't know if I'm here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don't know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don't know.

EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I'm feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.

To those who might be a bit confused, I've begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she's in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fn31cw/im_this_fucking_close_to_ending_it_17m_really/,442,[removed] ,2020-03-22 17:09:47

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent. But since I've been on a 5051 previously, (this time I wasn't, I was at the ward voluntary; I need help, I know that much and I'm open to getting it) that plan will be much much harder. 

Still, I am alive and I was doing really good! the meds are working, it's just that stray thought that's just started growing. But I'll bring that up tomorrow in PHP.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and ""you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable"".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

Don't be scared this is so normal. I went through this. We've created a materialistic world with a ton of pressure, its causing a lot of youngsters to feel this way. But you don't have to live that way...you don't need to compete. You could own your own business, or be a painter, or do your own thing. It changes. LIFE CHANGES. I am NOT the same person I was years ago. SO many new people came into my life that have changed my perspective. and guess what? the good news is your life will GARUNTEED change. Because that is life. It will not stay the way it is now. That alone gave me hope. Stick it out to see how it will change, because it will. Think about it...you've only lived 20 years. If you lived your entire life all over again (doubled) you'd still only be 40 and have a ton more to go. 

People changed their lives at 40, 50, 60. I would start with treating your body right and watch your mind change. Start running, eating healthy, cutting toxic people out. Write and write about a life that you wish you were living and see what you can do to actively change that....because we are manifesters. we can change anything.....

i’m really done. i never realized what people meant when they talked about the mental health care system being shit, i mean, i’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, different kinds of anxieties and borderline personality disorder for the last few years (and didn’t think much of it) until i realized that how i was feeling and acting was FAR from normal so i tried to get help. why wait 3 months for another therapy appointment that never ends up helping, if i can just kill myself in those three months? there’s no point to anything anymore, i have no reason to live. besides, i’ve tried to kill myself twice already.

I’ve had a long history of the crazies. I’ve had my ups and downs, planned suicides, not went through with it for some reason or another. But the other night I spent hours researching suicide methods (I don’t have easy access to my gun anymore, which was my main plan last year, since I’m at college) and I wrote out a note and everything, then fell asleep. The next day was the best I’d felt in months honestly. It was weird. I’d spent the whole night being the most suicidal I’ve been since before I got on antidepressants (got off them at the start of the summer...probably a bad idea but I don’t like being numb) and then the next day I was social, I talked to people, I felt actually okay. It was weird. I went back on a decline after that but it was nice feeling good again. I know it’s not normal to be writing suicide notes and planning my own demise and all that jazz, but is it weird to feel so much better after? Like I don’t know if it was just a needed release or what, because I mean I still want to kill myself, I’m not better. But I’m just curious if anyone else has ever experienced the same sort of feeling. Sorry if this is dumb.

There is nothing else that anybody can say to fix your past traumas that leak into the present or your ongoing troubles. I’m just sick of being told generic bullshit. “Fall back on old hobbies”. “What are your interests?”. Does it ever occur to you that when I’m depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation, it’s because nothing sparks joy in me anymore? I no longer have a) hobbies anymore or; b) no energy to carry out those hobbies. Telling me to go for a walk is unrealistic when I’m afraid to even get out of bed in the first place and leave my room because if I do, I’m afraid of what I’m capable of doing to myself and afraid of acting on my intrusive thoughts. Why am I afraid? I don’t fear death in itself but I fear dying. The pain involved in dying. The agony. The fear of it not working. Telling me to “oh eat your favourite food”, doesn’t fucking help. I have no appetite and I unintentionally starve myself. When I try to eat the smallest amount, I can’t help but almost vomit. Time doesn’t heal all and I hate being told that it does. Shit has gotten worse over time and I’m sick of people saying you have to have patience. Says fucking who? I don’t have to do shit and even then I did for the sake of other people. Not everything is a happy ending and people need to just accept that fucking fact. We aren’t always going to get closure. Some people just are played the unfortunate cards in life and that’s how it just fucking is. Whether you admit it or not, not everybody is going to fall to some happy ending fairytale bullshit and that’s the harsh truth of reality. Don’t tell me to go outside and enjoy nature. Looking at a bunch of leaves won’t magically make me not want to kill myself and won’t cure fucking anything. I need proper help but there’s nothing out there aside from “discover your interests”. Who the fuck cares. That’s just another way of distracting yourself from the problem and running away from it, not actively sorting it out because nothing can fix it. Irreversible damage and people act like going for a run or having a warm bath will fucking change anything. Cliche as fuck. I hate this life. I wish I was dead. Nobody gives a shit until then anyway, nobody takes anyone seriously until you’re dead and even then, they forget about you within a while anyway and don’t tell me that isn’t true. They do. Because it’s human nature to be able to grieve and move on, it’s within our innate tendencies to do so. Fuck this “life”. Living and exisiting are two very different things.

Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not built for this world. If maybe I'm not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe I should just take my life because I feel like I cant accomplish anything.

Anyways, hi, my name is Autumn, I'm 19 y/o transgirl and I graduated high school last year. As far as I'm aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. I've always had a hard time growing up. I was bullied so much in school, my parents werent the best, they physically abused me when I was a child, and mentally abused me in middle/high school. A part of me doesnt hate them (at least my mother) because I feel like they're not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me, they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me. They just decided to go the ""old school"" route of hitting me until I got better grades. Anyways, I hate my father. He's a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and I wish he would just disappear. 

Anyways, onto my personal life with friends. I am severely emotionally unstable, I experience things in extremes and I always constantly split between loving and hating my friends. I constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations, I selfharm, I spend so much money. Haha, I had a job with an income of 1.6k monthly without any bonus commission, but I'd spend all of it on everything. I cant control it. I always ended up burning bridges with my friendships, I didn't mean to, I dont want to. But I cant control my behaviors and I hate it. I'm trying real hard to go to therapy, I'm hoping I can start DBT to help me with my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).

I just want to have friends I interact with on a regular basis and play games with. I try my best to reach out but I guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me. Which can really hurt I guess. One recent thing I've really gotten into is FFXIV. I try to ask other friends to play but, I just get ignored and such. It hurts a lot. I dont hate them I think, I dont. I just, I wish I had friends they have and play with. It gets really boring and lonely. Aside from those things, sometimes, I wonder if everything would be better if I was dead. You see, I never knew escapism existed until a few months ago, and that's when I realized how for the past 19 years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world I've created in my head was extremely unhealthy, and because of it I dont see any reason in going on, I think what's stopping me now is how Ill informed I am with taking my own life and how afraid I am of coming out with permanent damage and not death. Aside from that, there are 2 other people whom I love very much and cant bear to leave alone. My dream job is to edit videos for a YouTube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend. I'd love that so much, but that's just a dream, given the current state of YouTube and everything like that, the chances are that's not going to happen. Sometimes I just wish I could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams.

Anyways, thanks for letting me rumble a bit. I'm not happy. I'm not okay. I dont want to be alive. But maybe i can make it through, i just sometimes wish i had friends like others I see, but I'm extremely shy and suck at conversation and such, its really hard. I think I'm going to go cry some more now, I'll see you all some other time.

445,fure5q,False,None,44,I wish humanity would burn to ashes.,SuicideWatch,"I hate society and its concepts of virtue and success.

It's telling that it's taken an outbreak upending everything in society as we know it for people to start recognizing fucked up things.

Suddenly, some employers are implementing much more reasonable policies to allow their employees to work from or just stay at home.

Standardized testing requirements in some places has been suspended, almost like they've finally realized there are more important things on the line. Not that that matters to me, because I'm a college dropout that sees degrees as badges of blind obedience.

Carbon emissions have dramatically decreased. Don't know the full facts, but I've heard that air quality in notorious places like China is actually somewhat breathable now.

So I hate when people tell me things like how it gets better, or how I'm going to be successful. Everyone beats around the bush. No one wants to admit that I'm a horrible and talentless person that just hates everyone and everything. I wish humanity would burn to ashes.

I dropped out of college 3 years ago and I've been living with my parents since then. I have no job and don't really do much from day to day. About the only passion I have in life is video games, and I've recently found enjoyment writing reviews and overviews of RPGs on a personal blog. Of course, because I don't know shit about promoting it, it's never going to take off in views and I'll never be able to actually TAKE that passion anywhere.

So, as someone who's dead weight right now, this pandemic is essentially what I've wanted. A disaster that grinds human society to a screeching halt, so I don't have to feel guilty about being cooped up in my room all day instead of trying to throw myself at a wage slave job.

And yet it hasn't changed a thing for me. I still hate myself for even thinking such toxic things. I'm still useless. I still have no future. With each passing day, the feeling that I'm running out of time and have to die soon gets stronger.

The funny thing is that I see a lot of people feeling guilty for doing nothing all day but playing video games. Ironically, that's the life I've always WANTED. If I didn't have to worry about things like school, grades, finding a job, and so on, I could live at my own pace. I'd read more books, learn random interesting topics, immerse myself into human culture, and learn more about the world on top of further exploring my passion for gaming. And you could argue that I could do ALL of that stuff right now since I'm not attending school and don't have a job. But the constant internal reminder that I'm a waste of resources stops me from doing that. The thought process is that I'm going to kill myself in the future anyways, so why bother?

I was so close to the finish line. One of my current ""obligations"", if you can call it that, is that I've pre-ordered two copies of the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake. One for myself, and one for a friend who paid me to get his copy since he couldn't pre-order it himself for certain reasons. The plan was that once that favor was done, and once I've gotten a chance to finish the game myself, I could finally let myself die. 2020 would be the final chapter to my pathetic story. There were lots of other games that I'm excited for this year that I was willing to give up on waiting for because I wanted to kill myself before June.

But this pandemic has ultimately taken that away from me. The shelter-at-home orders mean that I'm never going to be completely alone in the house, so I can't just attempt a suicide without any huge risks. And even if I DID pull it off, the last thing I'd want is for the funeral/corpse disposal to be complicated because of this outbreak.

The one silver lining is that I'll now get a chance to play upcoming games like Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Trails of Cold Steel IV before the time comes for me to kill myself. But I'm not sure that means much when I'm a terrible person holding so much hate for humanity inside of me, as well as the general sense that I'm trapped in a corner because I'm a college dropout with no job, no future, and no way to escape a life of wage slavery and overwork other than suicide.

I hate the fact that I always seem to have trouble putting my feelings into words, too. I've been looking through and editing this post multiple times just to try and get everything down. Why is it that I have so much that I want to bitch about sometimes, yet when I have the opportunity to write or speak about it, the words simply evaporate like dry ice?

Deep down, I secretly wish someone would finally just man up and tell me that I'm useless, rude, and toxic. To me, finally hearing someone tell me that I'm a bad person will make it feel like I finally have permission to die.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fure5q/i_wish_humanity_would_burn_to_ashes/,414,[removed] ,2020-04-04 10:25:38

449,8ssuet,False,None,50,The annoying lexicon of suicide dissuasion,SuicideWatch,"If anyone out here is legitimately on the verge of a crisis and seeking the slightest nudge of a signal from the universe that they ought to just go through with it, I'd strongly urge them to not read any further because I would never dream of being that catalyst to anyone. I'm a miserable, wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self-aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that I can poke holes of rationality in.

I fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide-support. The hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me. In a strange way I think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like ""you're not the only one going through this"" or ""you have so much to live for"" or ""things will get better"", I imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that they're momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all. For gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like I'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?

If you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. We're all fully realized, functioning adults here. We don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. We don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us ""Your'e not alone, we understand"", before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. What is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? The reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in OUR own lives, tragedies in OUR own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. 

I wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here. It is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. I wish people would just say ""You know what, I hear you. I get it. You do what you need to."" Because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical ""no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you"" bullshit approach.

That's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. I'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, I physically cannot even cry any more because I'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason I get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. And a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. Do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? It's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. It's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. There's nobody. It's all you. YOU ALONE are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. 

Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that the very problem that I have is that I have nobody in my life who would WANT to talk to me of their own accord. That's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. Then how is the solution to that problem to PAY somebody to talk to me? That simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. That even a designated ""helper"" will only talk to me if I incentivize them with money. And so the problem persists. I don't want a shrink. I don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. I just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say ""Damn dude. Shit sounds rough. I honestly don't know what I'd do if I were in your position. If you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - I guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. You do you. Godspeed."" That would mean the world to me. That would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. And that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.

We're fucking people. We still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on Reddit and navigate to Suicide Watch and type a post here. We're not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when we're gone. Some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. Some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. Some of us are ONLY still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. 

I don't know man. I've rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point. I just wish people didn't have such a simplistic view of things. It's not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say ""hey don't be sad"" and they'll be like ""omg wow! i never saw it that way before! i'm all better now!"". You can't go up to a suicidal person and say ""hey, don't kill yourself."" It'd be so much better if you could say ""hey, I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe nobody in your life will miss you. I probably won't miss you either. But I do hope you make it out of this sometime.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8ssuet/the_annoying_lexicon_of_suicide_dissuasion/,403,"You're somewhat right, there is absolutely no sense in people spouting the same template responses to those who are suicidal. That is not moral, that is not helpful, it is just as bad as telling people to kill themselves. However, if done right, by someone who cares and emphasizes, some people can be helped, and deep down those people really really don't want to kill themselves. They're terrified of their suicidal thoughts. These people need help, which is why i don't advocate for just encouraging people to end it when they SAY things are rough. Sometimes things are truly as rough and awful as people say they are, and sometimes, most of the time they're not. Most of the time people need a helping hand to get out of their head. I have waves of suicidal ideation, if people just told me to go ahead and kill myself when I tell them how much I'm suffering, I might just have done it. If I hadn't, I still would have felt more alone and betrayed than ever. How could people side with my terrible thoughts like that? I want to get better, but that is going to take a lot of work: my brain tells me the easiest way out is death.

My ability to think, my emotions to feel, my fire, my life. It has taken everything that I was. Nothing is left of me that is me. I wish I could kill what’s wrong with me and still live. But the reality is that I cannot. Please forgive me and allow me the dignity to be remembered for who I was, not what I became. It gives me great shame to know what I am now. To know that my smile is nothing but a mask, my eyes an ocean of despair. I have tried the medications, the therapy, held on to hope. But nothing will fix this. Just as cancer takes over a man and steals his life. So it is with my severe mental illness. This is a cancer, invisible, in the mind. Nothing can cured this. Nothing could have prevented this. I lived a good life. I traveled and felt the world beneath my feet, met good people everywhere I went, and it was beautiful. My life was not lived in vain. I was given a second chance by my parents and they showed me love and compassion. They showed me how to live again. I will forever be thankful for them and the sacrifices they made for a stranger, as they consider me their own child. My life would not have had joy or love without my family. I wish this illness never happened. I have overcome so much in life, but I couldn’t overcome this.

457,dsm2ni,False,None,52,My Suicide Note.,SuicideWatch," 

I don’t feel as if I need to really explain much; you knew I was suffering. 

Admittedly or not; you knew. 

And you can say I’m selfish.

And you can say that I’m a coward. 

And you can say that I couldn’t have been helped.

And you can say that this mindset was a choice.

And that you don’t understand.

And that you didn’t expect this. 

And that you wish things were different.

And that you’re hurting. 

But you’ll be okay. 

And I’m not selfish. 

And I’m not a coward. 

And you’re right, maybe I could’ve been saved; but I wasn’t. 

Someone once told me that I wasn’t broken, that I just needed someone to choose me. To love me. 

And that’s more than true. 

How can I feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn’t want to be in my life? 

Everyone that matters sees this light in me; including my parents. 

That I’m special. 

I am luminous. 

I am warm.

I am beautiful.

I am talented. 

I am smart. 

I am magnetic.

I am powerful. 

But at the end of the day, they choose to remove themselves. To enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch. 

Only ever touched for your own gain, your own pleasure, 

Just so show that you have me. 

But my beauty, my accomplishments—those are all mine. 

And I was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day, each week, each month. 

Beautiful they say, precious even. 

Kept safe. Appreciated. 

Used when deemed appropriate. 

Treated with care, sure, for the most part—  

When treated at all. 

Packed away. 

And it’s fine that you guys couldn’t be bothered much.

I tried to give myself meaning. 

To feel loved without touch. 

But when the only touch I can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me, 

And my voice muted 

My pain overlooked

My cracks sanded over, but never filled

What could really be expected?

My mother HURT ME. 

She hurt some of you. 

She hurt herself. 

And the elephant in the room is that we’re all fucked up because of it. 

IM fucked up because of it. 

I remember. 

I remember.

I remember. 

I FUCKING REMEMBER. 

I wish you’d let me talk about it.

I wish you would’ve be angry with me for hurting.

I wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home. 

I wish that I was never told that I was the downfall of our family. 

Because I wasn’t. 

And news flash: my mother wasn’t either. 

WHAT HAPPENED to her was. 

And I wasn’t alive yet. I don’t know what happened to her. 

But something did. And YOU know. 

So please, on my literal dead body, fucking talk about it. 

Let this be a lesson. Not about how you treated me, because that’s not what I’m getting at. This ain’t about me. 

Let this be a lesson about truth. About honesty. 

Talk about your traumas. 

I made my own decision, I did. 

Talk so each other. 

Please. 

I tried. 

I tried to take the broken pieces, the wholesome ones, the dark, and light, the beautiful, the confusing, the questionable, the hurtful, and loving, the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself. 

I tried to create something with what I had.

To play the cards I was dealt… 

but Rayvaun if anyone knows I’m awful at card games (did I just joke in my suicide note? yeah I think I did). 

Maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand, or a piece to your puzzle, 

but the game didn’t make sense to me; the pieces just didn’t fit. 

So I folded. 

I’m not sorry for what I did, unfortunately. 

I think this is what I needed and what you guys needed too; you’ll see. 

God sent me here to teach a lesson. 

About truth. 

About pain. 

About compassion. 

About how time doesn’t stop. 

Or something, I don’t know. 

I don’t have much else to say. 

I hope that when it’s dark out, you feel me in the chill of the wind

That when it’s sunny, you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin 

When the ocean comes and goes, you imagine my curls in the air… free, unapologetic. 

I wish that Kevin could know how much I love him. 

Please take care of him. 

He’s an angel. Truly. 

Here’s to best chances 

At peace 

At closure 

At warmth

At forgiveness 

Cause when your new eyes meet mine, you won’t see

No lies 

Just love 

Like snow 

Like gold

I will be pure.

Truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and I can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. I can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  I have tried holding out, I have tried soldiering on and I have done it for many years, but I live in a constant state of fear and suffering. My sister, who is probably the person I love most in the world, is one of the few reasons I have held on, because I felt that taking my life would hurt her. And I still believe that it would. But I have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. She deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? Honestly, I can't fight this anymore. I have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so I can sleep. I just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about IF I should do it and more about how I should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people I love the most. I'm thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train.

This is just one of the things I never did with my life, I've wasted it and spent the first 6 years being happy then the rest feeling unhappy wishing I relived those years.

I tried to reply to you all while in the emergency room but I had no service, here's a bit of information on what happened.
I had a champagne flute full of disinfectant, however I fucked up. Turns out I was too confident that cleaning chemicals are always toxic, turns out the disinfectant was citric acid based.
I tried to kill myself with citric acid.
I didn't even read the back, I'm so fucking stupid. Ny organs aren't even partially affected.
I was not admitted to the psych ward, but I nearly was. My psychiatrist understood that due to my agoraphobia it would not help to admit me, so he vouched for my discharge, which I was discharged 12 hours after I went to the hospital

469,7ry9uc,False,None,29,My name is John,SuicideWatch,"I don't know what I'm looking for here. I just want to be heard. I'm posting this on my actual account because I want people to know who I am.

Every day I wake up to a physical pain in my chest. It's the kind of pain that can't be rid of through Aspirin or ibuprofen or Tylenol, it's much like hunger, except it can't be satiated. Every day I wake up and feel it. But I go to class; I do homework; I smile; I laugh; all because that's what people are supposed to do. I'm supposed to get dressed and walk out of my apartment every day prepared to take on the world. But I can't. I'm tired. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of being alone. 

Every day I cry. Most of the time it's when my roommate is gone, but sometimes I don't have that luxury. I work at my school's library, and the other day I was assigned to sort books. While I was working, I lost it. I had to sit in the bathroom for 10 minutes and try to collect myself. When I finally left, I stared at the same title for 30 minutes, all while contemplating walking out of my shift and ending it.

I just don't know what to do. I've never had a girlfriend, and I was a virgin up until 21 til I finally had enough and paid a prostitute. It was shit. I couldn't perform because I was drunk, and she was obviously just in it for the money. No passion whatsoever. All through high school I watched my friends get in relationships. I listened to them talk about relationships and hung out with them and their girlfriends. I enjoyed their company, I considered them friends, but every day something inside of me collapsed a little.

Then, finally, at 22 I met a girl through Tinder. I really really REALLY enjoyed talking to her. We talked for like two weeks before we met up, and it was the first time I've been happy in years. Every day I was checking my phone multiple times a minute. Some people say that a relationship won't fill the hole inside of you, but after that night I can say with certainty that it is exactly what is missing in my life. I want someone to want me and enjoy my company. 

When we met up, I thought things went well. We hooked up. The sex was good - really fucking good - but what made me the happiest was the fact that someone liked me enough to do it with me. But a day later she messaged me and told me that she found me too awkward to talk to and that we shouldn't talk to each other any more. Now, this was a woman who has slept with nine other guys, some of whom were one night stands, and kept in touch with *every* other one of them. This was a woman who dated a man who could only eat pizza, burgers, and french fries, because he had such a bad case of anxiety that any other foods would cause him to break down.

But *I* was too awkward to keep in touch with. *I* was too much work. 

And that broke me. Whatever it was inside of me that had been giving all my life finally collapsed. For years, I've tried to socialize. I've tried clubs, I've tried jobs, I've tried talking to people around me in classes, and it hasn't done anything. I thought maybe it was because I wasn't physically attractive, but then I got in shape and it changed nothing. So I gained a little weight back, and then I met her. I had a chance with a girl. I thought she liked talking to me as I liked talking to her. But I was wrong.

Through her I discovered the truth; I'm fundamentally flawed. I can't socialize. I'm not attractive. There is *nothing* physically impressive about me. I have no hobbies. I'm boring as shit. I'm awkward. I have no redeeming qualities *at all*. I don't know what to do about it either. I tried a number of hobbies. Skateboarding, puzzles, reading, television, exercise, drawing, instruments, etc. It all bored the shit out of me. I had *zero* fun. 

I lie to everyone. I tell people I got laid in high school. I tell them I had a good size friend group. The truth is, I've never had more than a couple friends at a time, and I've never been in a relationship. Every day this eats me up. Every day I wake up, I'm disappointed that I didn't fucking die in my sleep.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7ry9uc/my_name_is_john/,399,Hey John.

481,ekr9h1,False,None,37,My friend (15F) is going to kill herself in less than a month.,SuicideWatch,"This is a call for help.

I met her at the start of 2019, where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school. She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.

Things seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn’t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she’s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc.

One day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.

On the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn’t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).

When she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary.

After her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.

She has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through.

Right now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it.

We came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:

* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)
* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?
* Since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?

Sorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn’t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.

&#x200B;

 

**Edit**

Thank you so much for all the advice and responses. My friend and I have talked it through and, I called the suicide hotline. After explaining the situation, the person told me that the best and most I could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her. If it really comes down to it, we are prepared to call the police.

To clarify some things:

Whether we want to or not, it’s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there’s three weeks to the end of the holidays. As far as I know, all the adults around me would rather I stay away rather than help which is why I asked for their help. All of our parents are quite strict as well, she’d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away, then calling after to tell them where she was. And when she got home, she was yelled at for a long time.

I’ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday, and continue to make plans with her, keeping in mind all the advice you’ve given us. I might post again in the future, hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health. Thank you so much for all the support you’ve given me, and I hope this turns out well for everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ekr9h1/my_friend_15f_is_going_to_kill_herself_in_less/,383,"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c6d1ll/my_advice_after_8_years_of_existential/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

483,cihid7,False,None,26,"I did it.... (Trigger Warning: Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Gestures, Hospitalization)",SuicideWatch,"TLDR at End

I have been passively suicidal for some time. Lately, it had become more active; I was making suicidal gestures nightly as a coping skill to deal with my depression, anxiety, and burnout due to the amount of stress I was under. 

Last Monday night, I took it a step further and tried to end my life by strangulation. I obviously failed, but I felt strange... unfulfilled? I didn’t sleep that night; I just cried. 

Tuesday I went into work and we were testing the fire alarms while I was training new employees. I just got this sudden, overpowering urge to kill myself because of the stress and noise and my disappointment in myself for the previous night’s failure. I also got a snap of lucidity. I blurted out to my office manager “I need to go to the hospital” and left work. 

When I got to the ER, and was standing at the front desk, the triage nurse asked me what brought me in. I looked at her and just said “I am having a mental breakdown” and started sobbing uncontrollably. They immediately brought me back to the safe observation room, had me do a urine screen and drew some of my dehydrated blood. They had me strip and put me in safety clothes (paper patient scrubs) and the ER doc came and interviewed me first. 

The ER doc decided I needed a psych evaluation, which lead to a psych nurse basically asking me questions about what was going on. At some point she asked my observer to get me some tissues, and I just started laughing. Uncontrollably. The nurse looked troubled by this. She asked if that was normal for me and I said yes, especially when I was really stressed and anxious. 

She started to explain that the hospital had two programs for psych emergency treatment; full or partial hospitalization. It was her job to advise the doctor on which treatment I should receive. She told me that she decided they were going to place me in full hospitalization. I asked if I had a choice in this matter and she just said “No, as of this moment we have a court order for your involuntary admission to the psych unit on a 72 hour hold. We are just waiting for the unit transfer to go through.”

I just kind of chuckled and said “that’s fair.”

The three days went by slowly. No tech, no outside contact. Just treatment groups (I painted a recipe box, drew a picture of a tree, learnt about the anger cycle and learnt waaaay too much about myself), mealtimes (we got a choice of what we wanted, within reason... and no sharp edges), and meeting with doctors, social workers and your assigned nurse. 

At the end of my involuntary hold, they asked if I was ready to be discharged from inpatient, and I said yes. 4 hours later I was released to the world, but not fully from the hospital. I was placed in partial hospitalization: weekdays I have to check into the program at 7:30, and get out at 3. They are further refining my meds as well as having me attend group therapy and occupational therapies and such. I have my first full day of PHP on Monday. 

I always avoided seeking help. When I went to the hospital, I had truly given up. They were nothing but nice to me, and being cared for gave me hope for the future. 

If you feel suicidal or self harmful, it can be hard and scary to go to the hospital. The cost can seem prohibitive. The social stigma can be repulsive. Admitting you need help can seem impossible. 

I’m not paying for my hospitalization or PHP; the hospital has a grant program if your earned income is below a certain threshold. No one knows why you are there (or if you even are there) unless you tell them or give the staff permission. And if you are on this board... you have already admitted you need help. 

I have learnt a lot the past several days. I entered with an open heart and nothing to loose, and grew because of it. Please, consider going to the hospital. 

TLDR: Tried suicide for the hundredth time, had mental breakdown, admitted myself to the hospital, got better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cihid7/i_did_it_trigger_warning_suicidal_ideation/,379,"Just a tip for anyone seeking to do this. Admit yourself in a county or township with a high income average and wealthy people. I happened to be in a terribly impoverished town one of the three times when i was involuntarily admitted and there are many downsides. Usually the facility is absolutely disgusting. In my experience there was shit and piss everywhere, no windows, one hallway, and i was sleeping next to convicts and murderers every night. on top of that, they are much more likely to try to extend your 72 hour or 302 hold into a 303 to keep you for another 21 days so they can make some more money. Just go to a wealthy area near you and admit yourself there. in the poor areas there is no help received, you simply have to fake feeling better till they let you go. In poor areas it’s more of a prison than  a hospital. ",2019-07-27 13:28:57

489,cp6tbv,False,None,56,Going to leave my suicide letter here,SuicideWatch,"I only have ever wanted to feel love.  I’ve always wanted to be loved.  But I struggle to feel connected to people, I struggle to believe that anyone in my life loves me.  I’m deeply convinced that nobody does.  

If there’s anything that I’ve learned in life, it’s that people can really fucking leave you.  And I could never understand why.  But “love” has always been conditional - be good, behave, don’t let your sadness show - and only then you’ll be loved.  It’s my fault people leave.  I always do something to mess it up.  Because I’ve never understood how to relate to others.  

People have told me I’m too difficult to love.  People have left me after seeing how sad and anxious I really get.  I’ve been told my entire life that my body is not okay and not worthy of being seen.  

I’ll never forget the therapist that ruined my life forever.  He diagnosed me, looked me right in the eyes, and told me I’d never have normal relationships ever again.  My life felt like it ended that day.  I was fifteen.  I’ve never been the same since.  Since then, I’ve felt like I was born wrong.  My entire existence was a mistake.  I was inherently beyond repair.  Nobody would ever love me again.  

Rejection.  Over and over again.  

I’m not worth being loved.  I’m not worth anyone’s time.  I don’t deserve safety or comfort.  

I feel empty.  I can’t see any life in my own eyes anymore.

I’ve hung on as long as I could in the hopes that someone would just stay with me.  I’ve bargained with myself, I’ve said well, if no one can love me, I’ll let someone abuse me if it meant they just stayed in my life.

And now, I’m almost 29, and I am truly alone.  I have no one I can talk to.  No one that knows just how dark it really gets sometimes.  I feel connected to no one.  I don’t feel safe around anyone.  Friendships feel superficial.  Dating and relationships are far too difficult.  Sex doesn’t feel good.  Companionship seems impossible.  

I don’t have anyone.

Maybe there are some people in the world that are just kind of meant to be discarded and forgotten about.  Maybe I’m one of those people, even though I’ve tried to make something of myself.

I just wanted to be loved.  That’s all.  I just wanted to know what love feels like so bad.

My therapist was really my last hope that maybe someone could stay in my life.  That maybe someone liked me.  I haven’t been able to cope without her.  Now that she’s out of my life, I truly am alone.  I don’t have anyone I feel like I can depend on anymore.  No one that supports me.  No one I can talk to.

Honestly, in my wildest fantasies, I just wanted someone to hold me and tell me they love me.  Tell me I’m a good kid.  That I’m doing a good job.  That I’m a sweet boy.  That I’m lovable.  That they will stay with me.  That I’m good enough.  That my body is okay and nothing is wrong with it.  That I don’t need to work so hard to get people to like me.  I wish someone could just look at me and tell me I’m okay exactly as I am.   

Being good enough is really one of my wildest dreams.  As long as I can remember, I’ve never been good enough and I always put in so much effort to make up for it in other ways.  But it’s exhausting now.  I’m tired. 

I don’t want to do this, but I know I have to.  After my body is found and I’m confirmed dead, I’d like to be cremated.  All of my belongings can be discarded.  My cats can go to loving homes - I’m hoping maybe people I know.  My social media can be taken down.  I imagine work and life will go on as normal.  

If my body is found and I’m not dead - I do not want to be on life support, I do not want to be resuscitated, I don’t want to be in any kind of vegetative state.  I do not want any type of end of life care.  I want to be euthanized as quickly as possible.  Under no circumstances do I want to be kept alive.

Maybe it’s my mental illness talking, but I genuinely hate how I am. How everything I do is selfish and how uncaring and unhelpful I am. 

A few months ago, I was practically begging my mom to take her anger out on me, to beat me, because I wanted an excuse to be depressed. I wanted to be traumatized, like she was from her own past. 

They buy me so many electronics I shouldn’t even have. I’ve dropped out of school, and when I was in school I’d missed so many days a school councelor visited my home. I’d ran away so many times, worrying them until their worry turned to anger.

At first i thought being normal would give me hapiness. So i took care of myself, i discovered sex and social activites in highschool, i discoverded frienship and for a time i really thought this was my purpose, that being average was good and that i was happy. I used to be socially akward and never talk to girls, never go out or talk to anyone. I was living in my imagination, escaping reality with virtual worlds where i was free 

And here i am,  21 yo, i just gave up my garbage engineering school . I want more, i want to fight, figthing for girls and being cool was futile, i want to succeed. I m working hard my maths and physics to get a better school next year. I was blind, but now i can finally see the beauty  behind the maths, the meaning of it. 

We are just animals, everything we do is useless. We are nothing, with the body and the mind of an ape. So we need to give everything we can to keep this body in a good state. I was an alcooholic and drug addict, i only lived in false worlds. I'm done now, no more suicidal thoughts, no more bullshit.

fuck you for telling an ugly fat incel to go get a girlfriend like it's no big deal.

fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.

Fuck you for not listening to me and gaslighting me whenever I say I'm unlovable you fucking ""professionals"". 

Fuck you for not taking me seriously when I literally carved the word ""unlovable"" all over my body.

Fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.

Because guess what you fucking sorry excuse of a mental health system, some of us don't get love or kindness just because we need it. 

I didn't go to you just because I saw and experienced a lifetime of emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse. I didn't go to you just because I was and still am constantly bullied for the way I look and act.

I've never done anything at all with my life, just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her. I am never happy anymore at all. Just more misery every day.

I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby.

My parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year (9th grade). Which means I have zero social skills. I don't even have the building blocks for social skills. I've never been to a party or even gone to anyone else's house, until this year at 14 I had never even talked to another person under 18. 

I wasn't even allowed to play games as a kid, I was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep. My parents were both extreme nerds with 130 IQs, neither of who wanted me, my mom just had me to spare her 9 months of endometriosis pain (she admits this is why she had me). 

I just don't care any more, my 15th birthday is Friday which means I can spend it alone in my room like any other day, after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday. Final exams that will result in punishment if I don't get A+, in my family I'm told I'm an idiot who needs tutoring if I get an A not an A+. B's are grounds for punishment. No, I'm not Asian.

I just wish I had someone to be with or something to do, all I do is make people uncomfortable. Some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness, not because they actually like me.

Nothing will change when I get older. I'll still be disgusting and will die a virgin, if I get to be 18 I'll just be an i*cel.

I feel like if I just wait and stay quiet, things will get better, like a toothache you ignore until you don't notice it anymore. Why bother a friend when I can just wait? Eventually the pain leaves and no one is hurt by the end.

But this pain isn't ending. I don't think the pain ever ended before either. New pain digs up the old pain. But I'm not about to ruin anyone's day. I'm not about to complain. My problems are mine. Who am I to foist my problems in someone else who's job isn't to deal with my shit?

That's exactly what it is: shit! What good is shit? What good is a person who has nothing but shit? I want to have never existed. Death seems like the next best thing. But I live in a place with no access to it. No tall bridges. No tall buildings. I'd take pills, but that's not a guarantee.

When the day came, I was still low enough to go through with it. I was set on it. However, during last period, he said something. He said he wanted to commit the act of falling on a sword (don't remember the word). He's suicidal as well, as well as most of my friends, so suicide jokes are common. What stopped me was what he said after. He said he would've done it already if it weren't for me. This changed my view instantly, and I didn't do it. It made me feel needed, and not completely worthless. The day after that day was actually a bit better, and it stayed a bit better. I haven't been that low since. It's still hard to deal with, but it's more bearable now. If I had actually done it, I would most likely be dead right now. I could never thank him enough, but I'll never be able to tell him.

527,7wxqrz,False,None,84,Nobody knows who I am. Remember me. Please.,SuicideWatch,"I'm sorry this is so long.

Nobody knows who I am. I haven't had a friend in years. I don't remember what friendship was like. When I talk to people, something always feels off, as if I'm speaking a different language or something. I just want someone to know me. It's so lonely and cold and empty and I just want to scream so loud that I hurt myself.
I was born in Alabama. I was an accident, my dad was and still is a meth addict. My mom is great and has raised me all these years. She left my real dad when his addiction got too bad. I was about 2 or 3, maybe younger. We moved to a new town, she met a new guy. My step dad. He was good at first. We moved to Texas for his new job, he broke. 
Something in his changed. He became abusive. He didn't hit me, and he only hit my mom once, but he was verbally and emotionally abusive. She was with him from when I was in first grade to fifth grade. 
He started storing food and water in his room. Note, his room. My mom slept in my room with me because she hated him. He thought we were going to poison him. 
Both him and my mom became alcoholics during this time, and would drink bottles of wine and then scream at each other all night.
Even though I was going through this, those were the happiest years of my life. Or maybe I'm just looking back with rose tinted glasses. At school I had so many friends and everyone liked me. Everyone though I was funny. 
In fifth grade my depression and anxiety started. I started to realize I was fatter then my friends and it hurt to think about. They started making fun of me for wearing undershirts instead of bras.
 My best friend was a boy named Ben. I loved him and I still do. I think about him a lot. His dad forced him to stop being my friend because it was ""gay"" to be a close friend with a girl. He pushed me away and now he's gone. 
I got chosen to do a speech at my school assembly because everyone liked me. It was for a pep rally. I was supposed to announce the winner of the fundraiser or some shit like that. They changed it at the last second, had some random old guy who donated to the school announce it instead. So they made me go up there with no plan and just wing it. I froze and everyone laughed at me. Or maybe they didn't, I don't know what's real and what's my anxiety imagining things anymore. 
I started lying a lot around this time too. Not to my parents, by to everyone else. I made up elaborate fake lives, I still do. They're nothing special, just, different.
My mom divorced my step dad in fifth grade. I had to keep visiting him for a while. He had completely lost it by then and would probably have killed us both if we hadn't left. One time I was at his house, my old house, and tried to run away because I was scared of him. He caught me and called the police on me. I don't know why. My neighbors were watching and called my mom. They were good people. 
The policeman got there and said I was lying. He told me my mom was putting all the thoughts of abuse in my head. Then, he forced me to hug my step dad while I screamed and cried in fear. That memory is one of the worst ones I have. He left, and I had to stay at my dads house still. 
He blackmailed my mom into giving him everything. The money, the car, the house, my dog. Just out of spite. I miss her. Her name was ginger. She'd probably be around 10 years old right now if she is still alive. I don't know if she is. I miss her even after all this time. We packed everything into a cheap car and moved back to Alabama. I lost everything. 
I started to realize I was different in middle school. I did weird things, I acted weird. I would touch other people's hair becuase I liked the way it looked. I still acted like a very young child even at 11. Don't know why. I didn't have a single friend in 6th grade. 
In 7th grade, I became truly depressed. I did ha e someone though. Her name was Mary. She's gone now too.
In 8th grade, I had a bigger group of friends. Everyone still thought I was weird though. I still did weird things, dressed weird too. I know there's probably something wrong with me but my mom is too scared to take me to a doctor to get diagnosed. She thinks medicine is bad. Pills specifically. That's why I'm not allowed any anti depressants either. 
When highschool started, my social anxiety was so bad that I started homeschooling. The homeschooling laws are so lax in Alabama that I barely did anything except play the sims all day. 
In 10th grade, we became poor. Lost the car, lost everything almost. She got a new job in Ohio, we moved again. I lost all of my friends again.
I homeschooled at first, then started going to the local highschool. I thought everything had changed, that I could be normal. It was hell. Everyone hated me. My favorite memory is when I walked into a room to get something, only to hear ""does she seriously dress like that? Wow."". It hurt. We were still pretty poor and I was doing the best I could. All of my clothes were from goodwill. There was one guy there who was nice to me. His name was evan. I hope he has a good life, he was one of the best people I've ever met.
Luckily I'm kind of smart and got into a program that let me start college early, so for 11th grade that's what I've been doing. It's so lonely. It's so fucking lonely I just want to scream and scream and scream but I can't. I've never know what it's like to be in love with someone who loves you. I've never kissed anyone or even held hands or anything close. I feel so fat and ugly all of the time even when people tell me I'm not. I posted on amiugly and everyone said I was pretty, I thought it would help but it didn't. 
I've become very paranoid. I'm scared all of the time that people are out to get me, that my life is a simulation, that I'm dead. I talk to myself. Either comforting words telling myself it's ok or long spiraling sentences about what a disgusting fat cunt I am. I'm scared.
I told my mom about the depression, and the anxiety. She doesn't know I'm suicidal. That I've been planning out what best way to end it for months. I can't go to therapy. There's a huge scholarship learning abroad program I'm signing up for and they won't let me go if I'm a fucking loon. 
So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. The only reason I haven't ended it is because I want someone to remember me, to mourn me, other than my mom. 
I have a sister. I only found out about her when I was 11ish. She's my half sister in my dads side. I don't know how old she is anymore. I was so happy to meet her. It was so good to have a sibling. I felt like I had a real family. She left for college and immediately stopped talking to me. I haven't heard from her in years. The last thing she texted me was a happy birthday text a few years ago. I miss her. She was good. 
Her and my dad won't even know I'm dead. My last birthday was sad. I had been planning out my sweet 16 for years. I didn't have any birthday parties for years because I wanted to have one big one. When it finally came around, I didn't have anybody to invite. It was just me and my mom. I ate some cake, opened my presents, and played video games. Not terrible at all, but not what I had been dreaming of since childhood.
I'm supposed to turn 17 next month. March the 20th. Please remember me. Please if you have the time, read my story. You'll be the only people to know it except for me. I hope you remember me. I just want someone to know me again. It's so cold being alone.

Goodbye

I didn't think people would care this much. The support I have received from all of you is legitimately amazing. So, thank you. I think I'm going to try and get some help, even if I have to put my studies on hold. Im trying to reply to everyone, sorry that it's taking so long.

528,guiobi,False,None,32,I AM REALLY CLOSE TO JUST GIVING UP,SuicideWatch,"everything around me just seems pointless to me. I am currently in the midst of an exam period and have done around 3 hours of study total for 5 exams. I have no motivation and just sit in silence just fuckin sad. I am not apart of a friend group and just have friends who each have their own friend group and always see photos of them out with their groups without me while I just sit at home. Specifically, there was a time where my mate who I routinely gamed with was going out every Friday and Saturday night thus taking away the limited time both of us were free to play games in. This meant I would get on by myself and just not enjoy it. 

I am just sick of not being included and ""loved"" in a way by my friends and peers and this shit is making me feel so alone and to make things worse I am 16M and still haven't had my first hook up (which may not sound like a big deal for my age) but always hearing about the new girl or guy one of your friends is with just adds to the loneliness. 

Also, the girl who is literally one of my closest mates is PERFECT in my eyes and I have been repeatedly sent to the friend zone and have to live with the ""pain"" knowing how bad I want to be with her and just care for her but she doesn't feel the same :/

Even better is when I only get to see my father twice a year for a total of around two weeks as he lives abroad married to another woman after my mum found him cheating with my now step mum. I won't get to see him until at least 2021 and just am overall struggling.

Sorry for the long paragraph but I am struggling with a lot of things and seriously contemplating ending it all just could never imagine the pain my single mother would feel. That is the only factor keeping me from ENDING IT ALL AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/guiobi/i_am_really_close_to_just_giving_up/,354,"It doesn't feel like it, but you're extremely young. There's a lot better days in store for you on your path so don't give up, but instead learn to let go. Your life is not pointless, but as humans we evolved to survive, not to see reality as it is. You can assign meaning in anyway you want, but just existing as you are is enough. You have played your role and continue to do so. You don't need to justify your existence beyond that.

As for your friends, communication is important. Tell them how you've felt, but be respectful and control your emotions when talking to them. Don't be clingy and don't attach yourself that you need them to feel whole. That's not good for you and it's not going to make them want to hang out with you either. To be happy just by yourself is what you need to grow comfortable with. I can also tell you that you don't want a hookup. What is a night of sex going to give you other than momentary pleasure? Is it so you can boost your ego and brag to your friends? You don't want that either because it will inevitably lead you down a path of suffering. If anything I would strive for connection. I was so fixated on sex (because I was filled with lust) that I missed a plethora of opportunities to explore connecting with people which is the really the reason sex exists in the first place outside of just procreation. I also grew up without a father as well. That is extremely difficult, but philosophy can give you what you lack as it has for me. 

I would say you genuinely need to find a different perspective outside of what everyone in your life is implicitly teaching you. Look way outside of the box. Look into Buddhism and other philosophies like stoicism. Jack Kornfield and Alan Watts on Youtube are a great place to start. Buddhist philosophy has saved my life so perhaps it can save yours. You sound just like me when I was your age so I hope you can find liberation quickly. ",2020-06-01 11:08:21

Today I felt it all coming back to me. 
I know I couldn’t deal with all that again.

Even if I were to continue living what's the point? I'm so replaceable, I lack self confidence to the point where I feel awful about letting people down when I mention that I'm sad.

I'm going to do this. Plan and all. Giving the people in my lives a final goodbye before I do it. At least they have a better look on to why I did it. 

Not gonna lie, kinda scared, but hey we all are gonna die anyways so what makes my death any different? I can literally write anything here about how I'm going to end it and no one I know will find it. Not that they would like what I've written. 

I dont care that I have potential. I don't care that I have opportunities. I just want to die after putting it off for so long.

I stayed there over night about 8 hours. A therapist in some other city video chatted me after being there for 8 hours. I had to use a prison toilet - in socks. She said I think you’re stable enough to go home and you’ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist. That’s it. Yesterday I got a bill in the mail for $3,711. For that one night where they did nothing. Nothing. I had to reschedule my appointments this month because I just switched jobs and couldn’t afford my co-pay. I have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me $3711? After insurance? For locking me in a room so I could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor. How pathetic do I feel after begging them for help and they do nothing. A lot of my unnecessary stress is money. Why is it so expensive to get help? Why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance? Why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is? It’s so fucking expensive. Getting a bill in the mail for 4 grand when you’re suicidal doesn’t make you excited to live. I now have a hatred for every person in the medical field cheating people out of their money and their health. Fuck you to those people that send the bills and a big fuck you to my asshole therapist. 

I plan to say these things to her in a kinder tone and ask her why she would recommend that for me. I’m really hurt because I trusted her and it only embarrassed me and made my life worse.

I moved in with my cousin two weeks ago.. since then he’s been overly loving. He will wake you up and talk to you all day. Literally, the first day there he talked to me for 9 hours straight... even when I went to the bathroom. I have a problem getting black out drunk and he brags about kissing me, watching me in the shower, watching me in the restroom, seeing me naked, I know it’s forced because I don’t like physical contact and I’m asexual that he forces me to cuddle with him when I’m blacked out and don’t remember. He found my phone and has my boyfriends number, best friends number, family’s number and he texts them all day about me and everything I do.. right now I’m having trouble with auditory hallucinations that my family know about, but I’m fixing. My cousin also always talks about raising me and always being a big brother to me... when I’ve seen him 2 times since I was 10 years old...

We have another roommate. My best friend of 7 years. He was in the room and it was 2am. We’d been talking to my cousin literally all day, because we never get a second alone together. My cousin had been drinking all night and refused to go to bed because he wanted to be there when my boyfriend got home so he could “chat” with him about me. But he was so drunk he kept forgetting my boyfriend wasn’t coming over. Finally I asked him if my best friend and I could have some time to talk alone. And he FLIPPED. He began screaming at us that we hate him. Why can’t he hear what I was going to talk about. We’re just conspiring against him.

He ran over to me. Held my arms against my chest so hard that my ribs have bruises, got literally so close to my face he was touching me... and screamed over and over about how he could hurt me so badly and that I don’t know who I’m talking to. He believes he can read minds and see “auras” and said he knows I’m lying. He’s screaming he’s going to beat the shit out of me. I kept telling him to just do it. And then he grabbed my face so fucking hard. And told me to try him. I then yelled that my dad owns this house. And that I was going to tell my boyfriend. And he got scared and backed off. 

Immediately he began texting me about how much he loves me... I left the house and ran down the street to my dads house sobbing. Iv told my mom... my sister.. my dad... everyone believes I was hallucinating.. they said my best friend will say whatever I want him to so his word doesn’t matter.. but he hurt me.. only my boyfriend believes me...

544,clm7h0,False,None,113,"I'm attracted to children, and now I've lost all will to live.",SuicideWatch,"Ever since I was around 14 I've been attracted to young children. I have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. All throughout my teenage years, I lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and I was so disgusted by myself. I was afraid of how others would react so I never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when I became an adult. When I reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and I entered a terrible period of my life when I was so depressed and yet I couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. When I looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. This stigma scared me a lot. After a year or so living in the dumps, I was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. I grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot I am, I thought that it would be alright to tell him since I thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. I explained my point of view and made it clear that I didn't act on any of my desires. Still, he immediately told my brother and I was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.

I then fell into even greater depression. I'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, I thought of things such as ""if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, I might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens"". I still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online I managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. I got a job, I made some friends and while I'm not rich, I could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. I was still attracted to children and I was still deathly scared and ashamed, but I internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.

I made one particularly good friend from work and I got along well with his family. After knowing him for a few years, I started to think that at least one person I know in real life would understand if I confided to them my darkest secret. It turned out that I'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. A week ago, we were having a few drinks, and I blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. I was still wary enough to stress that I had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and I thought that that would be okay. The thing is, I had met his nieces before when I was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. He stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that I had tricked him all this time, that I was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again. He's presumably told my workplace, and I'm expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon. 

I've lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out. I've been betrayed by even my family completely over this. Nobody understands me at all. The worst thing is, I can't even be angry. It isn't even unreasonable. I pose a tremendous threat to society. I understand that, which is why I fucking hate myself even more for this. At 29, I've lost all connections to anyone I thought cared for me, and now I've lost my will to live. I'm going to hang myself tonight if not earlier. Nobody will even care, so I won't bother writing a proper note.

558,eqg8kz,False,None,55,Why do both of my parents think everything i do is wrong?,SuicideWatch,"I’m 17 years old and these past few years I occasionally keep fighting with my parents with reasons I don’t even know.

The reason we fight is not because i was doing drugs, my grades are dropping, getting into fights, or anything that could get me into trouble.

It’s mostly of simple reason such as :
When we travel abroad at the hotel the staff seems to forgot to give us some coffee when he/she is cleaning our room. So my parents ask me to called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. So i did what they ask and called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. Then my parents asked what did i say to them. I answered “i just asked them to bring us some coffee”. Then they told me “why did you say that? You should’ve said can you give us coffee since you didn’t put one in the room when you were cleaning the room, and now we will have to pay for the coffee.” I said it’s fine and told them if that happens i will told them we didn’t have it before. They asked me to call the staff again to which i say there’s no need then they keep insisted on it and they start yelling and then we got into a debate
Just because of coffee......

And it’s been like this these past few years 
I mean i get it parents have ego and they want to have some sort of dominance over their kids but isn’t this to much? 
Since then i started to just take the blame to which i thought they would stop yelling to me.
They didn’t 

Just moments ago before writing this post i got into this type of debate again with my parents. 
But, this time i feel this would be the last...

I couldn’t take it anymore i just want to end this all i have no one to talk to and my parents who’s supposed to be comforting me in a situation like this is the one who’s causing the problem.
They keep telling me I’m wrong and after things cool down when i asked what did i do wrong they always answer with you’re not wrong and begin their an hour long speech about life.

I get no one wants to read this and no one cares about a problem of someone they don’t know. I don’t even know how to kill myself or do i even have the guts to do it. All i want is for this problem to stop and look for a place to vent so thank you if you’re reading this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/eqg8kz/why_do_both_of_my_parents_think_everything_i_do/,331,"Eh I have to side with your parents about the coffee. 

And with no other examples given, I must consider the possibility that you actually do a lot of things ‘wrong’.

About the coffee, your parents have a point. It sounds like they’re trying to avoid the possibility of having to argue with the hotel if the hotel insisted on charging for the coffee, which is a valid concern. You seem to think that it’ll all be fine but that’s not a given. What you could’ve done instead was say, “oh yeah i didn’t think of that possibilty. Thanks, i’ll try to remember next time.”

To make things worse, after they pointed out that you weren’t as careful as they are, your response was to fight back, ie refuse to fix the possible problem. What was wrong with calling hotel service back about the coffee? In my opinion, when your parents insisted on calling back, and you insisted that there was no need, you sound like the less reasonable party. 

...why couldn’t you just call back and clear a potential misunderstanding? Why, given the choice between 1) making a phone call and 2) resisting/fighting with your parents, you chose the latter? Is it because you have social anxiety and don’t want to call the staff too many times? Is it because you want to stand up for yourself and not follow your parents orders, for a sense of control? Is it because you don’t want to admit that you could’ve done something better?

I have to reiterate that this is the only example I have to go on.

And since this is the one you chose to present, I assume this is one that puts you in the best light OR is somewhat representative of the other instances of fights between you and your parents. So far the picture it suggests doesn’t seem to support your side. ",2020-01-18 13:13:46

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I am impresioned in my own body. This is slowly killing everything nice I had in my life. 

I know you will say, *it's only your mind you can fix it!*. But I am being In this for 10 painful years and there is little to no improvement. Just pain, day after day

Every day , I have to look to ones I love and feel the disappointment. The rage, the sadness of my condition. Today, the same happened , the same way it happened day after day for a decade.

I've come to accept my death and I embrace it with open arms. Each day drawing it closer, is a day where I am more and more happy knowing that the pain will go away. It sounds cliché but it really feels like it.

I've accepted that life is a flood, washing over me like waves crashing into rock, slowly eroding it away until there is nothing left but rubble and dust. It feel like I have no control in life. That I am just a person looking into another miserable persons life, who is getting worse day by day, slowly succumbing to the poison known as living.

I know that this sounds very cliché, but this is the best way of describing it. Grades are going down, I'm not loving what I do, I don't feel motivated to do anything anymore, feeling of existential dread is grinding against my soul like a grindstone at a knife, but no sharpening it, its dulling it and turning it into something with no porpuse, no love, no happiness.

It's not about the result, and they may die in the process,  but I'm more of a journey guy than a destination one, so if I die in the next hour from a meteor or pass in my sleep like people do sometimes, I am happy that at this moment I can put my thoughts into words, and the way I'm doing it isn't like some kind of professional writing technique but just free flowing thought with some play and variation in how I word things.

 Police rushed me and pushed me on the floor, i was so stressed out i couldnt move, and was like a stick (unvoluntary). They said i was resisiting and choked me until i managed to give them one of my arm. They finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic, 2 cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point, and i was still half naked...


 It took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... Nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)

They brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore.

 I was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. Nothing about why i was brought here. So i freaked out often and they shoot me. After this all went smooth. I like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)

They tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) I took the ambulance and once i was there... I dont remember ANYTHING AT ALL, nothing, niet, nada.

I have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... And i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.

P.s. I dont drink alcohol, smoke daily before night, so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map. Im 35 years old man, never lost counscious ever in all my life before that. And also i have zero violences back ground.


With all this story my question is: ""now where do i go to find help?"" Everything on the Internet say to go see your doctor, but now i can barely get out of my house. It was already very hard but now its unbearable.

 I have constant suicide thought for over 20years now but also have full custody of my 12years old daughter which i love more than anything else in the world. (she's in no danger whatsoever i took care of telling her mom what was happening to me so she take care of her)

It's just so hard to fight. I don't want to be alive. I want to die. 

Things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person. 

I found out my ex, who I still cared about deeply, was beaten to death. She died cold and lonely, with nothing. In the street in front a a fucking Salvation Army soup kitchen. She stole clothes to stay warm. And some asshole decided she needed to die for that. 

I found out that I have cancer. Even best case scenario, I am in for a ton of pain and misery. And that's if I even make it. I really hope I don't. 

And then, to top it all off: 

I got the girl of my dreams pregnant. 

The baby is gone. 

And she won't talk to me, at all. 

I'm not even sure what happened. Did she abort it? Did she miscarry? Was she trying to keep it? I can't get over the fact that I may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. 

Like, we knew she might be pregnant. And she seemed to not hate me. But then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn't, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 

How can you just give someone news like that and then disappear?

And if you can, it’s like maybe one or two people. Half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. 

You know all your “family and friends care” but it’s impossible to talk to them. You don’t want them to overreact. You don’t want them to worry. 

You can’t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. No one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. You don’t want to bring the mood down all the time. 

And the one person you trust to talk to can’t handle all of your stress. You can’t rely on just that person. It takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can’t tell them everything. 

And then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering what’s the best thing to do. 


And then there’s the planning. 

What to write in your note saying goodbye. What to do with your dog. How to leave your apartment. What date to set. 

I just wish euthanasia was legal so I could die with my friends and family by my side. I wish I could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. I wish someone could be by my side in my last moments.

And inflicting anything on them along the lines of ""you can do anything you want"" or ""life is worth living"", just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure, because they can't do what you told them to do, believe what you told them to believe, or feel what you told them to feel.  As feeling like a failure and/or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide, it is not hyperbole to say that ***these so-called ""empowering"" messages kill people***.

**Edit:**  One other very dangerous type of message is ""It gets better"".  Because of the prominence of The Trevor Project and other similar initiatives, a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that ""It gets better"" is not just an okay thing, but the *best* thing, to say to any suicidal person.  Nothing could be more wrong.  ""It gets better"" comes out of an initiative to reach LGBT youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  And the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  It's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  But as a ""hopeful"" message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  First, it makes promises on behalf of the Universe - and the Universe may not keep them.  Second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.

614,ctujqr,False,None,19,"I don’t even know how to say this but I feel like this is a good place to get all of it off of my chest, if I even can or honestly even finish this post. I know I’m suicidal but I don’t know if I will do it",SuicideWatch,"Basically, the depression began in 2014 when my dad killed himself.

No one in my family saw it coming. He never showed any indication that he was suicidal, except for his drinking, which he did when everyone was asleep and he never, to my knowledge, did anything bad while he was drunk. I remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom. Looking back, he drank because of his demons but no one noticed.

For two weeks after my father ended his life, my siblings and I thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries. I believed her because in a way, she wasn’t lying but I’ll get to that. My mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us. We were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions.

Now later on, we found out about what happened. I think there’s still stuff about his or my mom’s life I don’t know. Stuff about that day. But here it is:

The day before, I remember my dad saying he was going off for hockey. I think I said bye but I don’t really know. That was the last time I ever saw my dad alive.

The next day, I’m waking up for school and I find out that my mom and my brother had been up for a while, talking to police. My dad was missing and there had been a car crash.

At school, I confided in one of my teachers about the situation and I was worried at all times.

I get home and play video games with my brother. My dad is in the hospital and my grandma is watching us while my mom is at the hospital. A little later, my grandma gets a call from my mom telling her to come down to the hospital and bring us. A cop car comes and picks us up and drives us to the hospital. We arrive, discover the death of my father and my grandma’s son, and I’m freaking out.

For a bit, I thought I had heard that he was just in really bad shape. About 10 or something minutes after “finding out he’s in bad shape” I discover that instead, he is dead. I went blank with crying. I was horrified. I was whispering to myself “no” constantly and I was rocking back and forth.

Rocking back and forth when I’m nervous, scared, tired, sad or any other bad emotion became a habit since that day.

I ended up going into the room where my dead father was lying, along with my mother and seeing him dead was horrible but his eyes were shut and he always had a soul patch and it was crooked so I was able to laugh to that and get to say goodbye.

I go home after a while along with my family. My brother was at the hospital and my sister was not. At this point, she had no clue that her dad had died. She was off at university far away and my uncle drove to her to pick her up and drive her back. She was 4 hours away. That’s a long trip. 

She was freaking out because a friend of hers, who heard what happened, sent her condolences about her father without mentioning that he was dead. She was picked up and was so freaked out and worried.

I fell asleep and at 1am when I woke up, I go downstairs to see my sister sitting in a chair crying and balling her eyes out.

My sister, who I barely see show emotion or cry. Someone who’s older and I looked up to. And she was destroyed by this. I went up to her and hugged her.

My siblings are never affectionate. We hate each other or at least that’s what we tell each other. My brother and I’s way of telling each other that we care about each other is saying “You’re a bitch”.

So hugging my sister, something I don’t remember ever doing before that or much after, was a big deal.

This ripped my family apart.

Here’s how that day went for my father:

He was driving back from hockey when he suddenly crashed his car. He got out and left the scene. He walked through the fields so GODDAMN close to my house, and eventually went and bought paper, a pen, a knife, probably some other shit and went to a hotel. He checked in and I don’t know how long he was in that room but what I do know, is he wrote out his letters. There were many crumpled up papers of letters he scrapped. The police found out about the crash and where he was by now. They were getting to his room when he was in the bathtub and slit his wrists.

I have convinced myself in the past that he only killed him self because the car crash messed with his brain. But the truth is, he tried to kill himself with a fucking car crash. To make it seem like an accident. And he failed. But he couldn’t take it anymore so he slit his fucking wrists even though he knew we would realize what had happened. My dad was so depressed that any way of ending it was good enough. He never tried getting help and he left his family.

I hate my dad for what he did. But of course I also miss him. This whole post has already taken so long to write because I had to take breaks so I can have mental breakdowns.

I was originally going to explain why I’m depressed but after writing all of this out, instead I’m going to say you know what, I’m not even going to continue. I am suicidal but I won’t do it any time soon so I can explain the many shit in my life that has caused that in a later post but I’m going to use this post to say that...

DO NOT KILL YOURSELF
Please don’t.
Don’t do it.
My dad killed himself and it destroyed my family.

I didn’t read the rules of this sub so maybe this post is going be deleted or maybe I’m not allowed to bring up certain things like how it is done, but people already knew about that.

My life sucks because of my dad.
He’s the reason I want to kill myself and he didn’t even try to get help.

I hate him. I love him but god do I hate him.

My mom has her own hand in my depression which if I ever do another post, I’ll get to, but my dad is the root cause of everything awful that has happened in my family in the last 5 years.

You say you love him, but most of what was written was about the negative impact he had on your family by committing suicide. Nothing about the suffering he might have gone through. And I understand those letters are private, but the fact that nothing was mentioned about what he said in them only adds more to the suspicion.

You don’t even remember if you actually said bye to him the last time you saw him alive. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say you have given no evidence of him being treated badly but at the very least it seems he’s been taken for granted all this time. Nobody noticed his demons. Even when you knew he had been in a car crash you and your brother went home and played video games.

Your life sucks because of your dad? You love him but hate him? He ripped your family apart?

You’re only saying, “Don’t kill yourself, it’s selfish.” Something a lot of us here have heard many many times.

who the fuck made such a sad ass system?

im tired of living this way, where everyone look at you as a robot
as a ""you only here to do homework, we only spend money on your ass to go to school and later you need to find a job""

is this really it? life = money?
what are we? arent we humans? 
why cant we treat eachother with value and respect despite our wealth, looks?

why cant we love eachother and help eachother?
i feel numb, i feel frustrated that this is what we human really are, a greedy little fucks who only care about themselves
maybe not all of us , but the majority
of us are just like that 

im so tired of going to school to just ""get shit done to get to work to get money to survive""

and i say survive, not live happily
because there is nothing happy about our misrable world....maybe there is things you can enjoy or should i say now its just to ""destract myself from my constant suicidal thoughts and my depression""

everyone look down on you because ""you are a disapointment and you got no wealth""

everyone CAN rise you up and respect you because ""this man is a successor!
this man got that company ! this man is blah, that woman got the money""

and honstly....i undersrand how delucional everyone is but....i think we took it way too far

we are losing ourselves in our shit show
and im tired , i cant live anymore in a fucked up world that is
as a fucked up person that is me...

i want this nightmare to be over...
im tired of how we humans are associated with our school, work like we are slaves to our survival
if you want to survive in a crule,fucked up world go ahead....

but im so tired of always being a slave to my needs...i dont want to burden, bother anyone with my survival

honstly i dont care about furture,success,work,relationships
and life ingeneral

i just dont give a fuck anymore...its all meaningless to me
its all gray and pointless to me
like why am i even trying to do that or that? to just breath? to survive? to not end up homeless?
fuck this shit and fuck survival and fuck money fuck people fuck fake friends fuck relationships who they love only your looks,money
fuck family who treat you like a fuckin dog,slave
fuck everything and lastly
fuck me and mylife
soon i will die....
to free myself from my constant stress and my constant highly depressed ass

im tired of living... everything always gets the best of me

edit : also i forgot to mention...
why didnt god just make us less greedy 
make us less ""you have to eat, sleep,work to survive"" why didnt he just made us pure souls wandering around 
enjoying nature? without the need of food or anything? so we all could love eachother and FINALLY no more rape, war , murder
its all frustrating
why did god made us with so many flaws?
why cant god just free us from our suffering? 
the answer is simple ....it might be for ""reasons"" we humans dont understand
well why couldn't he just make us understand why he made us..
or it might be just for his entertaintment
just like us humans
when you are bored....you go watch a movie or something
maybe we are only toys and a show to him..
there is no exuse nor ""reason"" is justified to him for making us suffer like this

is there REALLY a good reason for him to make us suffer like this?? especially depressed,sucidal people? 
like you realize you dont live that badly you start to feel super guilty about anything to the point only death will free you from your constant guilt 
i didnt ask to be a suicidal asshole
i didnt ask to have a very close minded
family
i didnt ask to have such a fat body from the start
i didnt ask to be addicted on unhealthy ways to cope with my depression...
yet there are religions who tell that when you kill yourself you go to hell

Also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.

- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being ""larger"" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.

- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.

- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
 They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.

- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for ""letting him into the house"". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
 She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.

- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.

- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.

- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. 

Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. 

To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to ""get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit"". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.

Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. 

There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

My university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........

I can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can't get a job without experience and I can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn't help as I can't even stick my foot in the door.

I just don't want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I'm not around.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/el5nbr/i_just_feel_trapped/,290,"> There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

624,g3gvk8,False,None,86,I am a deeply stupid person and I feel completely hopeless,SuicideWatch,"For most of my life I've just been blissfully unaware. Classic stupid person attitude that I was special and unique, with no evidence to back it up. Recently, my life circumstances have forcibly shoved me into doing some reflecting, and I can come to no other conclusion than that of being a gigantic fucking idiot. Just all around dumb. It makes me want to kill myself when I consider that this is fundamentally who I am at my core. Here are some examples of how I know I am a deeply stupid person:

1. I smoked weed throughout high school and did the bare minimum to pass my classes and get into college. I never gave a shit about my major, but just sort of blindly accepted that I was going to college now. I graduated, after having spent most of my energy partying, with a degree that left me $75,000 in debt. I got a job in my major, but was laid off after three years. During my time at my job, I don't feel like I advanced at all, because I was incurious, lazy, and overall unengaged. I showed up half an hour late almost every day. I was a graphic designer, but didn't save any work for a portfolio, so I have nothing to show for it. I've been unemployed for almost a year. I can trace this unfortunate circumstance all the way back to high school, when I didn't have a care in the world. This is also a reflection of my non-existent critical thinking skills. If I had any foresight or insight into problem solving, I would have planned SOMETHING for myself throughout the years. Instead, I coasted through life as if I had no future, with no plan, no thought, and no fucking brains.
2. I can never remember anything. I can't remember names or events, in movies or in real life. Because of this I don't really have any opinions. I forget everything nearly as quickly as it happens. A friend of mine recently watched The Fellowship of the Ring. He was trying to have a conversation with me about some of his favorite parts of the movie, but it was all lost on me. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and I would consider it one of my favorite movies to watch, but I literally couldn't remember anything from it. It's like this with everything. I have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests, but I am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way. I'm a bore in conversation because I have nothing to say, because I've never really learned anything. This causes me to have very low self-esteem. I'm too stupid to remember anything, learn anything, or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting.
3. I am fundamentally lazy. For as long as I can remember, I always have taken the easy way out. I chose my college because I knew I would get in, and then I tried as little as possible. I spend most of my days on my phone, endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram. I don't take the time to develop hobbies or interests, because I'd rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom. I lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence: curiosity. I tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me. I'm so fucking dull I put myself to sleep. I can't keep things clear in my head. It's always a jumbled mess. There's no order to anything I do. I always have an empty fucking look on my face that says ""VACANT."" Even if I tried to learn something, I'd just forget it anyway. I'm going to lose all my friends because I'm so self-conscious about my idiocy that I get jealous of them for the smallest things, such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies.
4. I can't keep up in conversation or follow directions. Usually I just sit there quietly. I live with three very intelligent and creative people, and when we're all in the same room together, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as I listen to their conversations, which are clever, insightful, funny, and informed. I sit there quietly and feel like an idiot. I literally don't say anything. I have nothing to say. It's like this with everyone. I can't keep up. I'm slow and stupid. My friends are going to get bored of me. Who would want that around? Nobody will ever hire me because I'm stupid and empty.
5. I lack emotional intelligence. I don't know how to make people feel better when they feel sad. I don't know how to tell people what they need to hear when they're feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball. I'm an emotional black hole who takes far more than I could ever hope to give. There's something fundamentally lacking in the way I treat people. When a friend's family member died recently, I didn't know what to say to comfort them. I said ""I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love."" It's not enough. There's something missing. I'm so wrapped up in my own problems that I can hardly see outside of myself. I find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery. I wish I could help people. I wish I could help my friends feel better when they're upset. I never know what to say or how to say it. I come off as robotic and strange. I'm going to lose all my friends because I don't know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it.

These are just a few small examples. My idiocy extends into every area of my life. It covers my entire reality. Not a moment goes by that isn't informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one. I have official diagnoses of depression and ADHD. Over the past couple of months, I've diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum, but I've finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability. I'm simply slow and stupid. My intelligence is low. It makes me feel suicidal to know that I will never be able to have an insightful conversation. I'll never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. I'll never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child. My brain function is low. There aren't too many connections being made up there. I don't know what the point of going on is. I know I write kind of snappy, and it may deceive you into thinking that I'm smarter than I think I am, but please trust me that everything I've said is true. I just simply can't keep up with anything. I can't keep anything straight. I can't communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. I hate the person that I am and the person that I've always been. I'm so fucking stupid. I'm so ashamed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g3gvk8/i_am_a_deeply_stupid_person_and_i_feel_completely/,285,"I know exactly how you are feeling.
Just few minutes ago, I was watching a series and the protagonist was saying that she hates stupid people. And immediately I was hurt. It never happened before. I was triggered almost immediately and thought ""nobody chose to be stupid, it is how they are, how we are"". And I came to Reddit for some peace of mind.

I'm stupid. 
I'm not talking about education or paper knowledge. I  was our department topper in college, I am doing masters in one of the hardest courses in our country but still I'm stupid. 
Because I don't have common sense, my mind is always a foggy place, I do stupid things through out the day, I'm clumsy and I do dumb things on impulse which cause so much damage. 

I have depression and I thought most of it may be caused by the living situation that I'm in right now, and once I could get out of here I can change for the better.
But once I realized there is something wrong with my brain, I was destroyed. Like you, now I'm hopeless too.

I can never be like my peers. I am getting bullied even at the age of 23 because I say the stupidest thing to my friends and slow to catch up. 
I do most of the things absent mindedly.
Even if I wanna do everything right, if I put on the spot, or if others are watching what I am doing, my brain immediately crash down and they proceed to think that I'm dumb. 
And like you said I don't even try to learn things because there is no use. I am going to forget about it all in a month.
I can't remember places, my old classmates names (like just 2 years old).
People talk about routes and geography, places but I could never make any connection. I don't even remember the places even I go. 

I too cannot engage in a conversation with my friends because I have no points to add. I just sit their listening to them.

I'm helpless and hopeless too.

But one thing I have to say is don't give up. Find a way to live your life. Find a job that you love or by anyhow be determined to build your career and do what ever make you happy.
Then you don't have to live up to the society's standards. That's what I'm gonna do. 
Atleast you don't have to worry about others. I'm here getting anxiety attacks thinking about going back to my friends, my church because the way they treat me like shit. So all I'm concerned about right now is getting away from them.
Good luck. ",2020-04-18 03:39:33

628,9wr0c6,False,None,88,I got arrested buying drugs off the darknet that I intended to kill myself with via overdose and now I am facing a felony and 5-8 years in prison. Whats the point in continuing on?,SuicideWatch,"I have been depressed for a third of my life (the last 10 years).  I have attempted suicide by overdose (opiates, benzos and alcohol) 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time I woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened.  The second time my parents found me and EMT s were able to narcan and resuscitate me.  The third time I overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to 7 days later.  I don't know if I was unconscious for those 7 days or what but I was incredibly week, dehydrated and disoriented.  That was almost a year and a half ago.  Every time I survive I try to give life another shot and every year I find myself worse and worse off.  I know I am incredibly lucky but I wish I succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide.  I feel like I am in the movie office space, everyday feels like the worst day of my life.

I don't want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time.  My life had continued to deteriorate and I had gotten to a point where I could barely take care of myself.  I stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged.  I lived in my apartment, only going out to get groceries, go hiking and snowboarding.  I asked my parents to take care of my dog because I loved him too much and he deserved better care than what I could offer at the time. 

Its not that my life is necessarily terrible, well at this point it pretty much is, I had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard.  Its that I have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like I don't deserve what I have been given.  I am terrified of failing so I take very few chances and unfortunately even when I feel confident enough to take a chance I end up failing which brings me down further.  I feel like my life peaked after high school, not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement, I graduated with full IB, honers and a 4.11.  Unfortunately when I first went to college I had a series of events/failures that destroyed my self confidence.

Anyways back to earlier this year.  This was going to be my 3rd attempt at finishing my degree and I had failed again.  I have been lonely and single for 3 years, my last girlfriend cheated on me, and this Christmas my work at the last moment made me stay home so I spent my very first Christmas completely alone while my family all spent the holidays out of state.  Things were going downhill and again I was getting more and more depressed.  I started getting out to go hiking and snowboarding less and less as it became difficult to even get out of bed and make sure I had food to eat.  At this point had lost my job, my friends were sick of hanging out with me because I was too negative.  I felt like I was only living for my parents but even they were sick of my bullshit and lack of progress in life.  I made the decision to order drugs off the darknet, as I had done a few times before and do it right this time.

My package was intercepted and federal marshals did a controlled delivery.  I was arrested and sat in jail for 2 months.  I'm always surprised when I think that life can't get any more unbearable and jail was just that.  After that I was forced into drug treatment for 6 months and am now living in a sober house under close supervision.  My court date is a month away and I am facing a felony and up to 8 years in prison.

I have tried everything to get better I have a therapist and a psychiatrist.  I have tried nearly every anti depressant and am currently on wellbutrin, which doesn't do shit.  I have tried DBT and TMS.  I don't understand why I should keep going.  I have completely fucked my life up.  Even in the best scenario I will probably get the felony and multiple years of probation.  I'll be barred from a ton of jobs that I was interested in.  I can't even get a job at 711 right now because apparently this is already showing up on my background check.  I probably will struggle to get housing in the future.  I can't even imagine having to go to prison much less for 8 fucking years.  I just feel like this is torture, every day that goes by is another day closer to my judgment day.  My friends and family have abandoned me.  I was evicted when I was in jail and lost most of my stuff, I'm broke.  It just doesn't make sense to keep trying.  I feel like I have gave it multiple tries and its just been one failure after another.  I am so fucking lonely but as much as I would love to have a girl in my life a part of me thinks it would be too selfish of me to make someone have to deal with my bullshit and never ending stream of failures.  What is the point?  Even if my life weren't a complete shit show I would still feel this way.  I just feel like I am pointlessly torturing myself at this point.  This whole year has been like a nightmare that I can't wake up from.  Sometimes I wonder if I actually succeeded in killing myself and this is just my punishment.  I forgot what it means like to be happy, to be close to someone, for someone to actually be proud of me.  I feel like I am just a disappointment and I might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date.  I have already pretty much decided that if I get prison time then I will do it but I fear I wouldn't get the chance if that happened.  I felt so helpless in jail, they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation I feared the most in life.  Losing my freedom, my humanity and locked away in a room with no stimulus with no way out and no way to kill myself.  Why should I continue to wait around for that to happen?

634,95bmmt,False,None,21,I think the main reason why I don't kill myself is because I don't want my cats to be sad,SuicideWatch,"Title sounds like a joke. It's not.

Me: 41 years old and I've never, not once in my adult life, felt that I belonged anywhere. My childhood wasn't bad (no abuse or anything like that), but my parents divorced shortly after I was born. I have no memory of them being together. Looking back, I spent a lot of it being passed around. Sometimes I'm living with my mother. Sometimes with my father. Sometimes with my grandparents. Meanwhile, no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond. They were just keeping me alive. My parents were young and stupid (both were 20 when I was born). My grandparents were giving, but distant. They gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a TV.

At some point, around ten years old I developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence. I couldn't even say my own name. I remember being 15 and 16 and wondering how the hell I was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk. I was seriously thinking that I would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work. It was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence. 

Today, I'm still a stutterer, but I can work with it. Stuttering is awful when you're young and aren't yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity. 

When you've lived with it for awhile though and you've been around the block, you can get good at hiding it. You get better at choosing your words. You also care less about everyone accepting you. With that burden off your shoulders, a stutterer can get by all right. Even when you have the odd tremor, it's more a conversation piece than an embarrassment. 

Yet, I still feel like I don't belong anywhere in this world. I never joined the rest of the world. I have no real friends. Family connections are tenuous. The family I was closest to are all dead (my mother passed on Christmas Day 1998, due to liver disease from her heavy drinking; my grandmother passed in 2005).

I thought I would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time I reached my 40s, but I'm not. And I don't know why. Maybe I've made my bed here and I don't know how to make it anywhere else.

One thing that I can say about myself is that I'm not angry. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't hate anyone. My situation is no one's fault, except mine, and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine. My story isn't anything special.

I've just always been sad. I don't know how to be anything other than sad. And I hide it. I HATE the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so I keep them bottled up. I cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much I like the people I'm around.

I've thought about suicide. I've stared at pill bottles. I've given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub. 

BUT I've never done it. Never even tried. 

My feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after you've exhausted EVERY last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive. Hate your life? Change it. Quit your job. Get a new one. Change your habits. Talk to someone, even if it's a bartender. Start painting. Start a blog. Learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something. Come up with a goal, even if it's very modest and silly. If it's not self-destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, it's a good thing. Maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish.

Last year, when I was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast, I reached out for my idea of a life line:

I adopted a cat.

A young cat. Five months old. A girl with a lot of life left in her. 

I brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment, she jumped into my lap and went to sleep.

And I started crying. Overcome with emotion. I knew right then that I loved her. And that no matter how sad I am, I need to live so that I can take care of her. 

A few months later, I thought that she could use another kitty friend so I adopted another cat, a little boy, a few months younger than her. 

After a rough first week, they eventually became friends and I now love them both equally. In fact, all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want I shower on these two cats. They get nothing but endless affection from me. I only buy them the best, most healthy food (according to my research, at least). I talk to them and play with them daily. If I somehow won an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris or somewhere today, I honestly don't think I would want it. As sad it may sound, I'd miss my cats too much. 

A cat's love is interesting. They place no importance on pleasing you, so they don't cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command (at least my cats won't). Sometimes they do though, and it's amazing. Cats look at you as their servant, which, to me, is funny and cute and a role that I'm happy to fill. It keeps me sane in a weird way.

Meanwhile, cats do become attached to you. Mine follow me everywhere. They sleep next to me (or on me) in my bed. If something scares them (the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm), they run to me for protection. We hide together underneath a blanket.

I love them so, so much.

They haven't cured my depression, but they have given me something to live for. The thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesn't love them as much as I do all because I had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about. They belong with me and I belong to them. 

And my cats are both young. My little girl is a year and three months; my little boy is about to turn 1. 

Helping them live long, healthy lives has become my goal. These cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years. And I need to be here to serve them.

650,dzjrh6,False,None,49,I failed,SuicideWatch,"A couple of days ago, I finally decided to end my life. I decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.

657,b80g12,False,None,49,"You ever just have everything going for you, but you fuck it all up?",SuicideWatch,"Life was going well for me. High school was a breeze. I got into a good university for engineering. I had a great social life and an amazing girlfriend/bestfriend. 

I fucked it all up.

It began with me being lazy in university. I procrastinated many assignments to the point where I ended a quarter with 3 F's. I try to fix my grades by the end of the school year. Still have GPA above 2.0, so not kicked out yet. However, my FAFSA application was declined because of the poor performance. That was the only way I could afford classes as I did not want to go in debt.

I decide to do work and earn money. I got a job at McDonald's and, luckily, did not have to work in service, only production--which is great since I'm introverted. I work there for 6 months and decide to quit one day. Thought I'd be able to find a better paying job, but that proved to be more difficult than I imagined. 

That same year, I had relationship issues. Around the end of February of last year, I found out my gf had cheated. Though, it was explained that it had only been a day of her cheating and she had only kissed the guy. I decided to forgive her and continue. Fast forward to May 2018, she leaves me for the same guy and fucks him. I'm too in love, so I decide to give her another chance. 1 week later, I catch her sending nudes to the same guy. I forgive her again. 

December 2018. Same time I quit my job. I'm unemployed. 6 months since the last time my gf did anything (I had been with her for 3 years, this was the one year it was bad). I'm looking for jobs, but no one is interested. I'm struggling.

January 2019. 20-year-old Honda begins to die. I'm left without a car for a month. Girlfriend decides to leave me (To be clear, she meant the world to me. She was the only one close to me). I'm heartbroken. In a desperate attempt to save our relationship. I walk to her place, 10 miles away, a 4 hour walk. I promise everything...that everything would get better, and I would fix myself and our relationship. I'm rejected. I'm starting to lose it. 

I can't live in this world without her. She was the only one, the only reason I kept going. We talked of marriage and our future plans a lot. It was a set path, and just like that, it's gone. February 2019. The last time we talk.

I have no one to talk to. She was the only one I could talk to about my personal problems. I had no other close friends. My relationship with my family is almost nonexistent. I'm stuck with all this hurt, and have no way to let it all out. I begin to hang out with my friends online, and begin to hang out with them irl. I tell them about my break up. ""That sucks,"" they say. That's all I get. I expected as much....

March 2019. Me and a few of my friends decide to get jobs at a warehouse. Pay is decent and job isn't that demanding. I could do this.

Since the break up, however, I haven't felt happy at all. I struggle sleeping. Any thought of her would just make me depressed. There's no escape from her. So many things remind me of her. I can't listen to my favorite music anymore because she enjoyed it. I break down one day and decide to message her. I explain that in sleepless and would like to talk to her in person. No response.

2 weeks after getting that warehouse job, I get fired. I hadn't shown up for 3 days without notice.

I'm a failure.

Same week, I learned that someone had stolen my identity back in 2012. I learned about this after doing taxes and stuff. IRS stated that I owed $4,000 from 2012. I was 11-years-old then. I didn't work. So I have that to deal with now. On top of that, I owe $2,000 for my car.

Recently, I've found out my ex has moved on to someone else. There goes my chances of ever fixing that again. To add, being with my ex allowed me to hang out with her group of friends whom I loved to hang out with. Since shes no longer with me, I'm no longer friends with them. They were a big part of my social life since sophomore year of high school.

So now, I'm a lonely, lazy, desperate, struggling failure that wants to end it all. I have a history of cutting. I cut so deep freshman year that I have huge scars on my left arm 5-6 years later. I almost committed suicide by stabbing myself, but I pussied out. After what happened to me and my ex in May 2018, I tried committing suicide again through overdose (unfortunately I lived and kept the attempt a secret from my friends and family).

I could have stayed in university if I had just done my homework. I could still have a wonderful girlfriend if i had fixed our problems sooner. I could be making money if I wasn't a quitter. I'm worthless. 

I've tried so hard no to think about suicide, but it seems to be the one thing I desire most now. I have nothing going for me. My relationship with other people isn't strong enough for me to stay.

My situation isn’t even that bad, I just can’t get this anxiety, insecurity, overthinking, depression out of my fucking head. For years and years I’ve been trapped. Maybe escaping for a little while but always reverting back and almost always worse. 

I just cannot be fucking bothered living anymore. Im tired 24/7. Socialising is so difficult with this mess in my head, and all I want is friends and a partner but all I do is lose friends and isolate myself because I’m fucked in the head.

667,bhebhr,False,None,80,Mental Hospitals never work,SuicideWatch,"So a bit of backstory: In my state, if you show any sign of wanting to hurt yourself or others, can you be forcibly sent to a mental hospital (for a max of 3 days) after going to the ER to check if you've tried anything and being assessed by a psychologist (for at least 30 minutes). 

This has happened to me twice. The first time, I only got assessed by the psychologist for about 10 minutes but thankfully I was released after a few hours.

The second time however, was much worse. So I went to the ER, had to stay overnight, wasn't seen by a psychologist until 2 days later AFTER being sent to the mental hospital (which I'm 99% sure is illegal). Also, I didn't get registered into the mental hospital's system until 6 hours after I arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff. Not to mention while in the ER, I overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients. While in the mental hospital place, I never actually got better. I just trained myself to be all smiley and happy. Because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed.

&#x200B;

TLDR; mental hospitals cut corners, don't care about you, and teach you to repress and hide your feelings.

EDIT: some other bs at happened at the second time (which was at a university hospital, btw) included:

i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost.

the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel. i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible. this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more.

i wont be letting anyone know. part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me. everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me; none of them interacted with me how expected.

so i wont be telling anyone, they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication (at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone)

I love being with people, laughing with people, sharing stories with others, but I'm unable to relate to anyone. I feel alone. I have my family but that's the problem. My parents are the problem. Ever since I was young they were overly protective of me and never allowed me to go out with friends or have sleepovers with our neighbors. This left me with the disability to socialize well. I am now unable to relate with others, I don't know how to talk. I don't know how to form a bond with others. The worst part is my parents don't give me any attention. Every time I talk to them I feel like they're not treating me like I'm a child and I don't deserve to talk to them. Everytime I open up about being lonely they just tell me to ""grow up"" and stop being emotional. I'm already 18. I feel so confused. I feel sad, I cry often. The only things that put a smile on my face are my dogs, video games, and Netflix. Other than that I have nothing, no one. I want to be a strong person and be capable of living without attention from others but I doubt I'm capable of that. I'm very emotional. From the past few months suicide was always on my mind. That's probably because I feel really lonely, and also because I want my parents to emotionally suffer too, because that's what they did to me.

683,gyyxz3,False,None,15,I can't stop crying. I can't shut my brain up. I can't function and I can't stand it and I need to make it stop.,SuicideWatch,"I'm sorry this is so rambly and incoherent, I'm sobbing so fucking hard and I can barely breathe but I tried my best to make it make a little sense and to break it into paragraphs at least.

Last week I got in an argument with someone I was close to and said things to them that really hurt them because I was hurting a lot myself.  It's things that I didn't and never ever would actually think or mean but they just spilled out because I was hurting and terrified and my brain just...broke.  I know that's no excuse, I hurt them and it's awful, that's all there is to it, I feel horrid and I always will.  But yeah, they said and did hurtful things too, it was bad on both ends.  I ended up in the hospital on a 72 hour hold.

As a sidenote I realized a few hours after the fact I'd forgotten to take my depression/anxiety/etc. meds the day of that fight and I hate myself so damn much.  If I ever forget them (which happens from time to time because I have quite severe ADHD that makes me very forgetful) I get especially sensitive and emotional and more prone to being a big whiny baby and if I'd just remembered to take them I'm 99% sure none of this would have happened but I'm so goddamn stupid and useless that I forgot and now everything's ruined due to my own fucking stupidity.

Anyway.  I came home and things are ruined, people who used to say I'm amazing and wonderful are now saying I'm a bad person.  Everything I thought I knew about myself and others and my relationships and friendships has been completely shattered.  I don't know or understand how people who truly cared about me could change their opinion in a heartbeat.  I don't understand how people who claimed to love and care about me can be so indifferent to the fact I was in the damn hospital having a nervous breakdown over this.  I'm entirely lost and confused and broken, I don't know what ever was real anymore because I just don't understand how someone can go from ""you're amazing"" to ""you're a bad person"" in the span of days.  I have a couple other people still telling me ""no, no, you're wonderful, anyone who knows you knows you're the kindest and most selfless person there is with a heart of gold, fuck anyone who says otherwise"" but I feel like I'm being pulled in all directions.  I know I shouldn't depend on other people so much to base my worth or my opinion of myself but I'm really a weak person with no self esteem so it's really sometimes the only way I can gauge what kind of person I feel like I am.  If that makes any sense at all.

I feel like I've lost so much.  People who meant so much to me.  Memories that I should be looking back on with fondness make me cry and panic and I get so scared and confused because I just don't understand.  Not just memories with the person in question but memories with ANYONE because it's like my whole sense of trust in people is gone.  I don't know what's real anymore.  I don't understand.  I've tried talking and doing everything I can to make it right and people refuse to listen.  I've been hurt so much by people and I always forgive because I understand that who we are when we're upset doesn't always reflect reality and what we actually think or feel, I know that saying things in the heat of the moment doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Being mean and hurtful in the heat of a fight doesn't always come from a place of calculated malice and mean you don't care.

I forgive and forgive and forgive and I've bore so fucking much lasting damage that my brain finally just snapped and broke and then I fuck up and everything is ruined.  It doesn't seem fair.  It doesn't seem right.  And I know that me forgiving someone doesn't mean they have to forgive me in return but I just...I don't understand.  I don't know how someone can go from saying I'm wonderful to saying I'm a bad person in a span of days.  It doesn't make sense and it has completely fucked with everything I thought I knew about everyone and every relationship I have.  I'm so scared and I feel like I can't trust a single person or anything they say anymore.

All I fucking wanted was friendship and company and I tried so hard and now I don't even know what's real anymore and I'm being told I'm a bad person...I've been crying and crying and crying so fucking hard for days on end, since I got home.  I keep having panic attack after panic attack and freaking out thinking I'm having a heart attack.  I can't handle this, I can't function.  I just want it to stop.  I just want it all to fucking stop.    I'm so fucking tired of feeling alone and worthless and useless and fragile and unlovable and broken.  I can't fucking take it anymore and I just need to make it stop.

I've had fights with people, including very close friends, before and it has never, EVER affected me like this.  I feel like my entire brain and sense of self and everything I thought I knew about every relationship I've ever had has been absolutely shattered and I don't know what to do.  I tried to talk and make it right and I get pushed away.  I just don't know what to do.

I was going to post this under a throwaway because some people know my Reddit account and I'm honestly scared I'm even going to be accused of attention seeking or trying to guilt them or something by posting about it but I can't even be bothered to, I'm so mentally and physically exhausted, my brain feels absolutely broken and I don't have the energy or will to do much of anything.  They already think I'm a bad person, who fucking cares.  I'm terrible.  I'm so sorry.

Update a few hours later:  thanks for the kind words everyone, they mean a lot to me but i really really can't do this right now.  i made everything worse and really ruined everything and i'm nothing but a huge joke to people i love and care about.  i'm weak and I'm stupid and i forget things and words come out wrong and I hurt people and I can never ever forgive myself.  I made an utter fool of myself in front of everyone and said horrible horrible things and I accidentally blabbed about something someone's extremely insecure about because I'm so stupid and forgetful and my brain is so foggy I straight up fucking forgot (not that they'd ever believe me regarding that).  I never once judged anyone and I always cared and loved everyone with all my heart, I'm just too much of a goddamn stupid broken mess to go about anything properly.  I hate myself, I hate my brain for betraying me and confusing me and upsetting me and making me act in ways I don't want to or mean to.

It was 4 AM. 

I was cold. I was lonely. I was tired. I was intoxicated. I was depressed. I was just about ready to finally put a bullet through the roof of my mouth.

But I hadn't eaten in three days, and I sure as hell wasn't dying on an empty stomach.

I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. It was going to be the last cigarette I would ever smoke.

I walked to my local McDonald's. It was the only place still open. It was completely empty. There was one employee left, manning the cash register.

I placed my order and pulled out my debit card.

""Sorry, the system's down, we're cash only for about 10 more minutes.""

I nodded and took a seat in a nearby booth. I could wait for 10 minutes.

I listened to the song on the radio. ""Just a couple more minutes,"" he said.

Another song went by. Then another, then another, then another, and another... 

He walked out, bag in hand, and handed it over to me. ""Don't worry about it,"" he said.

Confused, I walked to the cash register, debit card at the ready. ""So is it ready yet?""

""Don't worry about it.""

I was shocked. ""Thank you, sir.""

I'm 25f. This post is going to be incoherent, because I can't really string my thoughts or sentences together anymore. I don't expect anyone to read this, and if you do, I'm sorry. 

 I've got a lot of mental health problems and it seems like every doctor diagnoses me with something different. 

The one person I told everything too is so tired. I love him very much, but I know caring about me is a burden. He needs more consistency, stability, and sustainability-- things I don't think I can offer with my brain.

I think this is a vent, but also the closest thing to a suicide now that I have. It's just the truth of my life, and why I'm ready for it to be over. 

I was raped at the ages of 4, 8, 14, 19 and 24, some of those years included multiple times. I've been kidnapped / sold. I've been a victim in a shooting. I've been forced to watch children die (murdered). I found my friend after he committed suicide when we were ten. I've been severely stalked. I watched my mother lose her battle with cancer. I've had friends murdered in college. I've been severely beaten. Hungry/starved. Homeless. There's been so much. And I'm so, so tired. 

If anything, I just want boring years where nothing happens, but I don't think that's possible. Everyone says the bad times don't last, that others have had it worse. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of hearing these things from people who don't have to live with my brain or experiences. People tell me I'm so strong but I feel so weak.  I don't want to fight to live. I don't want to survive anymore. I wouldn't even call this a crisis because I'm just so ready, so calm and numb.

If my guy sees this, I'm sorry I couldn't give you everything you needed. I'm sorry I couldn't get better.  Take care of the cats for me. I hope you find happiness, comfort, warmth and love. 💙💛

7 months ago, I got tinnitus. An incurable chronic condition which causes a ringing in my head. For 3 months I was coping with it. Until January. I began to develop hypercausis, a side effect of the condition. This side effect is extremely severe. It causes me to perceive normal sound as painful. I am unable to continue my passion of music and playing instruments and it makes everything else in my life almost unbearable. Around the same time I developed and anxiety disorder.

so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her CPR. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the ER waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a CT scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 AM on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up.

713,gybb26,False,None,41,I fucked up my body and my life thinking I was transgender.,SuicideWatch,"Go into my post history for the full story. I'm too exhausted to type all of it back up.

TL;DR: I thought I was transgender, took testosterone injections for over a year, realized I was just a masculine/androgynous woman, dealing with the fallout.

I am now a woman with a deep-ish voice, horrible acne scars all over my back, thinning hair, an enlarged downstairs, profuse body hair, deformed breasts, and facial hair.

I feel like a fucking freak. It was a long, horrible road realizing I made a mistake and was not trans, but a road I drove down much too late. I can deal with most of it alright. Body hair can be shaved if I so desire to, I can raise my voice pitch through voice training, there are creams or whatever for the acne scarring. My thinning hair is actually regrowing since I stopped injections a few months ago.

But my genitals and breasts will never be the same. I can't remove my facial hair permanently without spending several hundred dollars (I am very broke.) I have permanently mutilated myself with these injections. Ironically, they were supposed to make me feel ""more aligned"" with who ""I truly am"" but for me, it was really just a desperate attempt to slap a bandaid on the gaping wound which is my body dysmorphia and deep rooted self image problems.

And to make matters even more delightful, there exist certain individuals who take my suffering and twist it to fit whatever political agenda suits them. Trans people hate me because they think I give them a bad name and discredit medical transition. Evangelicals and TERFs love me because they want to use me to discredit medical transition.

I don't want my pain to be misappropriated for someone else's vindicative internet posts. I don't want my story used to harm real trans people. 

I hate my stupid fucking deformed body and I just want to go back in time and kill my past self so that she never ever takes that first testosterone shot. Never has to feel this pain. It's abysmal staring myself down in the mirror every day. To see the effects this powerful drug has had on my poor body.

I have been suicidal for many years but lately I just feel something evil growing inside me, something which will give me the power to end my own life before my rational brain can talk me down. I have no job, I'm actually on the comedown of a terrible LSD trip, I'm a budding alcoholic and binge eater. No one will ever love me like this. Its not like I've got a great personality to make up for my physical flaws. I'm depressing and condescending without realizing it.

716,1pdmai,False,None,19,I didn't kill myself thanks to this subreddit. <3 you guys,SuicideWatch,"9 days ago on Saturday, I decided to kill myself. Wanting to kill myself finally overpowered the knowledge of how much pain I would cause to my family and friends. I just woke up that morning and realised I could not take another fucking day. I was going to wait till my parents were asleep, than I was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky. Funny thing was the knowledge that I was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while. 

I didn't do anything special. Same old shit. I even finished off a school assignment for some reason. I don't know why. Played Xbox. Went to gym. Went for a run. Talked to a few people on skype. Walked my dog. Had dinner. Dinner was weird, thinking it was my last meal. Said goodbye to my dog, told her I hoped other people would walk her when I was gone. Said goodnight to my parents for what I thought would be the last time. Hugged my grandma goodnight. Went to my room and locked the door. Decided to smoke some weed one last time. By then it was about 10:30 and I knew my parents were going to sleep at about 11:30 so I had some time to kill. Said I’ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself. Went to this subreddit. Read through all the top submissions and realised I had never tried to fight this. I had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when. It helped that I was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me I was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort. Took 3 sleeping pills (my usual dose) and passed out. 

The next day was shit. Still as depressed as ever, still wanted to kill myself. But I legitimately tried to get better. And by the end of the day I had smiled without faking it for the first time in months. I felt happy for a little bit. And I realised that I would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again. It was just a simple thing, my dog licking me on the nose while I was listening to some music. In the days that followed things haven't improve much but I haven’t legitimately considered suicide since.  I’m determined to beat this one way or another. I’m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not. But whatever happens, you guys saved me from killing myself that night.


Much love.

i don’t know if i believe in some kind of afterlife, whether it be heaven or living out a life as a ghost. but part of me wants to kill myself, just to be able to watch my own funeral. call me an attention whore, i get it. but god damn. how do people really feel about me? and how many people are faking it? i want to know if my father tells the truth when he says he couldn’t live without me. i want to know if my mother can finally say that she loves me at my own funeral. i wonder what kind of words my only two friends will say, and i want to see if they actually cared. if they actually were my friends. 

there’s so much i want to know, and all of it is basically craving to know that someone gives a shit. and if killing myself is the only way of giving myself a chance to see that, why shouldn’t i?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ckl3rj/why_are_we_only_appreciated_when_were_finally_gone/,244,"The thing is that people always say nice things at funerals.

719,8ptidy,False,None,105,"""99% of people regretted it!""",SuicideWatch,"Please, I planned that overdose for so damn long. Even got myself an alibi! Enough to kill at least three people, but a family friend stopped by because they needed to use the bathroom on their way home and found me. Legit, when I was passing out, I have never been so happy, so relieved, that everything was finally going to be over. The first time I attempted, I was fourteen and I was so happy when I passed out and thought it was over. Every time, even.

Can you imagine how angry and disappointed I was this time when I woke up tied by the wrists and ankles to the hospital bed so I ""wasn't a danger to myself?"" For nearly three days I was kept strapped down and injected over and over and otherwise ignored because I was ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and all those words to describe someone who just REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to die. Three weeks later in the psychiatric ward, most of it seclusion and some of it again restrained to the bed because I refused medication. It's easier to pacify someone who isn't given the right to function, I suppose. Now I'm back out on suicide watch.

I don't understand how someone can put people through shit like that ""for their own good."" Well, I guess it worked in a fucked up way. Now I want to die more than I've ever wanted to, but I'm so fucking terrified it's going to go wrong and I'll be locked up & left to rot tied to the bed again because I've been in the hospital so many times that they just don't know what to do with me. Why is it so hard to understand that death might just be the answer? I have NOT reached out for help, I've only tried to die on my own terms, and I get treated like a violent criminal. Do you know how terrifying it is to be incarcerated in a ""hospital"" against your will and being denied freedom and having an army of rough guys hold you down so they can force meds into you?

Why the fuck do people do this to other people? It's so much worse than dying, and now they've even taken away the last freedom I thought I had. I really don't want to live, but I'm too scared to try to die. I can't go through that again. Maybe 99&#37; of people regretted it, but for ten long years I've never once regretted it. They don't believe me, though. They just lock me up and throw me back out when they've given up or when I'm ""stable."" I'm not a person to them, I'm just cattle that comes in, gets processed and punished if I resist, and thrown back out. Nobody gives a fuck about me, and nobody does anything if I complain because every record tells how ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and ""suicidal"" I am. No rights, no problems.

How is this okay? How is this the world I live in? How can I possibly want to live? Why am I put through all this just for trying to die?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8ptidy/99_of_people_regretted_it/,243,"I hear you! How 'patients' are treated is horrifying at some places! I've seen it up close and feel so angry for you. The world has no idea what goes on in psychiatric wards because no-one listens to the complaints of a 'mental case' at any level. Human rights are routinely violated and it scandalous!

That being said......perhaps a higher power is looking out for you? What are the chances that person came knocking when they did? I can't help but feel you are meant to be here, for some reason? 
You are an advocate for the suffering of psych patients as you remember what they did to you, so many do not!

They aren't urges to hurt them or, god forbid, do *that* to them...but I would sometimes imagine them naked and using the toilet.

That sounds really strange, and this requires some backstory on me: since my teens, I've been aroused by images of people going to the bathroom (don't ask why, who the hell knows).  It mostly pertained to people my age...but then I accidentally came across a kid (Google Image, I don't go to any...*sites*, good lord) and found myself equally aroused.  I was horrified.

I know this is really, really gross and sick, I know.  It's happening more and more often, these thoughts.  I had a therapist who knew, but when she moved away, I had no one.  Trust me, it takes months or even *years* to build up that kind of trust for me.  I can't even say the...word...itself because I am so sickened by how I think sometimes.

On one hand, I feel so much emotional pain that it's killing me, but on the other hand, I also feel so numb and empty and lost. I can't process it.

I wanted to propose to her. The worst part is that the reason she did it was because she was being sexually abused by a ""friend"" of mine for years, but kept it a secret from everyone because she was being blackmailed by him. 

I feel like it's my fault. I should have realised. I should have stopped it from happening. I can't believe I let that piece of shit anywhere near her. I feel so much guilt that it's driving me crazy.

I've been ignoring all the phone calls and text messages from my family and friends because I can't bear talking about it because I don't want to acknowledge that it's reality. I haven't opened the door to anyone who's tried to come and visit me.

You resolve. You plot. You choose the tools. You cradle them and know you can end it in minutes. You cower and retreat, and it comes in waves and you attempt again but flee again too. You cannot tell anyone. You cannot hug anyone. There’s no one to hug.

Your parents and grandparents age. They inquire ceaselessly after your condition. You lie again. You say things are fine, the social life survives, you enjoy work. You enjoy nothing. You drink. You smoke. You masturbate. You cry some more.

748,89pqvh,False,None,33,I understand suicide,SuicideWatch,"I'm starting to understand people who commit suicide. It's like, when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just can't imagine living it every day, year after year. You have people tell you it gets better but it's been years and it hasn't so it probably won't and you're tired...so tired. You just don't want to fight through the day anymore. I think when you commit suicide it's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it. Suicide is indeed selfish but, perhaps for some, they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first. Always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were...how they were managing...if they were ok. Maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldn't take it anymore. For some, life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest...they enjoy it and love it...but for others...its so long...never-ending...painful. Being alive and living are two different things. Maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their lives were so busy taking, they couldn't give a minute to realize. Death is funny like that; it's not always on a physical level. 

I have struggled with my depression the majority of my life. While those I care about thought I've gotten better, the reality is, I've just gotten better at hiding it. There are nights that I lie awake dreading waking up, living the day that just ended again, over and over. It's a cycle that never ends...nothing ever changes. Nothing good is sustained. Life just continues tomorrow exactly the same as it was today. Every bad decision plagues me and losses I've suffered haunt my thoughts. On the rare occasion I attempt to reach out, I know I will mostly be met with half hearted attempts to listen or understand. There is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line. 

Night before last, while lying awake, I realized I understood people who committed suicide. That scared me. I am in a dark place and I have never felt more alone in my life. This is a time where I could have used the most support. At this time I no longer feel capable of maintaining relationships. It's taking so much effort and I need to put everything I have left into my children.

753,8xwnnr,False,None,27,This sandwich doesn't taste good.,SuicideWatch,"It doesn't. Bizarre as it is, this sandwich just doesn't taste good. It doesn't really taste like anything at all. It should, though. It's got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo (well, miracle whip actually. I'm a heathen of sandwiches). Tons of flavor. I used to love this sandwich, and I'd eat it while doing things I loved to do. It was my gaming sandwich, my movie watching sandwich, my writing sandwich, my singing sandwich. I think the only thing I never used this sandwich for was foreplay. Mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood.  


Probably should post this on my throwaway account but...meh?   


I guess it's not just the sandwich. On my other monitor, I'm rewatching Dragonball Z for the umpteenth time. Majin Buu is paused, looking like an idiot. I love Dragonball Z. Watching it is supposed to make me happy. Same with everything else I've tried watching for the past two days...West Wing, Pacific Rim, Jurassic Park, Freakazoid. Temporary distractions, which is good, but ultimately they just aren't giving me any pleasure anymore. Nothing is.  


I'm so exhausted. I've been exhausted for weeks. But sleeping is terrible. All I do is lie there and think about people I've hurt, friends I've lost due to ways I've treated them. There is no atonement when they don't even speak to you anymore. I catch glimpses of them -- accidental Snapchat stories and things like that. I look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so I can hear them talk to me again. It's a common fallacy in the world that somehow ""taking responsibility"" for your actions makes everything okay. I almost wish I was ignorant to my own wrongdoings -- right now, I'm just furious and guilty and there's nothing I can do about it. So I lie there, listening to white noise or comforting ASMR videos to try and keep my brain at bay. Usually though, I'll end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death. Who will get contacted first, based on which methods and which scenarios? How will certain outliers in my social circle find out? Who will be mad, who will be devastated?  


I never intended on posting to this subreddit. I've lurked here many times when I was feeling suicidal, and I'm not exactly sure why. Reading about other peoples' suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better. And typically, I'd actually feel worse for being in my mental state when I'd read other peoples' stories. Stories of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment. The worst the world has to dish out, that's what would send people to this dark place in their dark times. Me? I'm just...weak, I guess.  


I've been fighting off my own death since I was 14-ish. I've attempted suicide a handful of times already. I was a cutter as a teenager, then I moved to more drastic attempts. Had to be talked down from an overpass once. My most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my Klonopin prescription, March 2017. That was the closest I've gotten to death. Right after I did it, I called my mom. I wanted to die but...I was still scared. I was sobbing on the phone. When she realized what I'd done, she got the paramedics to my apartment. By the time they arrived, they had to break in my door. I'd lost motor function. I vaguely remember the phone call, and I vaguely remember waking up in the hospital.  


Anyway. This sandwich doesn't taste good. Life has lost its flavor, and I'm exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year.  


In November 2017, my life broke down. Hard. I had been living on my own, in Vegas. I had a great job with a great company, making decent money. It was stressful, hell yeah, and in a micro-view I was unhappy. But if I looked at things in a macro sense, I was doing great. I had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time I was working bananas hours, I was hopefully working towards a new promotion. I had goals. I was really trying. I was seeing my primary physician, my psych, and a weekly therapist. Everybody was on board with my mental health. I was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working. My therapist and I were several months into the process and I felt comfortable talking to her. I was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out.  


So, then it all just went poof. I broke down. Stopped going to work. Stopped talking to anyone. Just, abruptly, one day. Didn't show up, didn't call. My brain led a savage counterattack, like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness. I hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state, posting nonsense to Facebook. Eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home. I returned, but nothing changed. I lost my dog, gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than I could. I went to be with my parents in Ohio to try and sort myself out. Stayed there for about a month. Visited family. Tried to re-center myself. Same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to Vegas in January.  


Got back to Vegas. Walked into my apartment and I realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. I was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. And that's not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. I'm saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. Calling, texting, trying to reach me, and I'd blown them off. Their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. You can't help someone who won't help themselves.  


And that's exactly what happened. All through January, I stayed holed up in my apartment. I burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. I neglected my bills. I didn't care, at all. I let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when I was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. It was fine by me. I just...I felt like I had been switched off. Whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and I was just drifting along the current until I washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  


Lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. I insulted people, I hurt people, I did things I regret. I think I may have caused that close friend's cat to die. I had some sort of other person or personality ""take the wheel"" for a few days. It's all kind of a blur.  


But eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. Eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. She took me hiking. I saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. I had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than Chinese or Dominos delivery. We got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. Dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that I'd still been holding onto out of denial. We wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. She took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. She did a one-woman barn raising.  


She left, and the message was clear: \*you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you\*.  


I didn't.  


In no time at all, I was just as withdrawn as before. Even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn't enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   


My father showed up one day. I let him in. We started packing my belongings. The movers showed up. We sold my truck. I tried to hold my head high as I said goodbye to my friends one last time.  


""We'll see you in a few months dude.""  


""It's just a temporary thing. You just need some time to figure yourself out.""  


I knew it was lies. I knew even then, I wouldn't see these people again. I really did love them all, they'd been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. But I knew this was different. It felt different. Because it didn't feel at all.  


I drove back to Ohio with my dad, and I did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. My mind was swimming and I really didn't remotely care about taking a road trip, but I knew he was excited so I tried to fake it for him. When we finally got to the house, I hugged my mom. She was so happy to see me. So relieved. It's got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can't help. I took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  


And I sobbed. I sobbed tears that hadn't wanted to come out for months. This was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but I knew deep in my core that it was the end. I looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was already dead.  


That was early March. Here we are, nearing the middle of July. I still tried, to be honest. I tried, despite having no desire to do so. I tried to find solace in my family and I tried to rekindle my love for music. I joined a band. I started posting my own solo projects online. The band thinks I'm great, and the solo stuff I've posted to /r/makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  


And none of that matters.  


I've never thought to myself ""the world would be a better place without me"". No, I'm fully aware that I bring joy and light into peoples' lives. I'm funny. I'm talented. I'm smart. I'm not half bad looking, either, when I take care of myself. Honest, I know all of that. I just...I don't \*care\*. I'm so exhausted. I'm so done. It's going to be in the next day or so. There are train tracks not too far from my house...I'm just going to park nearby, and start walking along until I can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. I can't fight anymore. I can't keep living life where I cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. I can't just sit here in my parents' house with no job and no purpose. I'm exhausted. I'm all out of fight.

I mean, those programs can easily land you a $40k + salary job. Which is sadly higher than a lot of adults out there. Idk how it is in your state but usually financial aid can basically pay you through your entire 2 years, it did for me LOL it was basically free school (Washington state) ",2020-05-06 19:15:48

756,q4xjk,False,None,154,"Warning:  ""Suicide methods"" PM Troll is active at SW.  ",SuicideWatch,"
##Edit:  June 11, 2012:  We're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending PMs inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  Please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  Thanks!##

If you get a PM that looks ""official"", encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to ""painless"" suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**.  Please **include the reddit account** that the PM came from.  

This person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our OPs with PMs that appear to come from us at SW,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.  
*****
**If you get one of these PMs, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       
He's** ***using you*** **to target /r/SuicideWatch.**
*****

Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the OPs were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the SW moderators.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  The troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  This is completely false.   A rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   Suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  That means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    Callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  However, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  

It's very important that you report any PMs of this nature.  Please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the PMs, or defend the troll's actions.

I have been seriously planning to kill myself today - I have enough sedatives for a lethal dose, and I’ve had a bottle of wine to myself genuinely planning to eat the lot, but I’ve been fighting the urge all day and I finally tried to call someone.

The fact that the lines were so busy made me realise I’m not alone - there must be countless people trying to call my country’s helplines and somehow it’s oddly comforting to know that the reason I can’t get through to someone is because so many other people are right on the edge.

I’ll keep trying to get through because I need someone to tell me I have a reason to keep living, but I just wanted to say that it was eye opening to realise so many people are in the same situation. 

It’s not like resenting people being in front of the queue at the supermarket. There may be someone out there with their wrists open and bleeding out, whilst I am just very close to acting. Who am I to take their place in the queue?

For the past 2 years I've had pretty much daily suicidal thought, I wrote my suicide note in november and now finally decided what day I'm gonna hang myself.

I'm 21 and ashamed of myself and hate myself in every way. I have zero confidence, I haven't achieved anything in my life, dropped out of college, anxiety makes me stress/freak out about thing other people do like it's nothing. Even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure I am. Got a horrible relationship with my parents. I don't enjoy anything anymore, every aspect of the future frightens me. Losing touch with my only few friends. Been starved of physical affection all my life beside of being abused by an older cousin when I was about 9. I've never even kissed a girl and now it's too late for me. I'm hopeless cause I'm too inexperiencedfor someone at my age and not good enough for anyone. I'm skinny af and fucking worthless no one has ever loved me or ever will.

Love only gives me negative feelings. It makes me anxious, panicky, makes me realize I'm not good enough. All the stuff I haven't done or experienced before makes me freak out  just by thinking about it so why even bother trying anymore. For the past months, despite trying to surpress it, i've been falling in love with the only female colleague I have a pretty good connection with but she's rediculously far out of my league, quit a lot older and will leave soon so it's another heartbreak either way. Better end it before yet another all time low. I have empathy and am glad for other people being happy and in a relationship but even just hearing a love song makes me instantly suicidal.

However, this Holiday season I have been feeling it extra hard, and I don't know why. I have tried to do everything I can to cheer myself up. I've gone above and beyond generous with gifts for loved ones, even wrapping them nicely (not an easy feat for a klutz like me), was going to dress as santa on xmas for my baby nephews. Tried dressing a lot nicer at work. Figured fake it until I make it. It's worked in the past. But last night I found myself driving to my local gun store, about 30 minutes from me, and looking at guns to buy. I used to have a decent sized collection / cache but had given them all to my dad because of prior suicidal inclinations. Then over time I would take them and sell them at a gun store or pawn store for a quick buck. I don't have any more. I bought a Kbar combat knife a week ago and tried slashing my wrists while in the bath tub but couldn't do it. Just ending up cutting a little. However, last night I found myself wanting to buy a gun. However, with me as someone who likes guns I want the gun to have meaning. Isn't that fucked up? Like almost anyone will do, but I wanted something specific. Found one that was almost exactly what I wanted and priorly owned, but didn't end up purchasing it. Instead I drove around for a bit and just meditated. Although I am debating going back there today, getting that gun, driving to some scenic place and redecorating the interior of my car... 

I hate hurting people. I have seen what suicide has done to people. My best friend killed himself while drunk almost 5 years ago. It tore everything apart. My girlfriend's brother killed himself shortly before Thanksgiving and it has torn her apart. I have tried being there for her but of course keeping my feelings down.

779,299vs3,False,None,172,I need help... but I don't know what kind.,SuicideWatch,"I’m just putting this out there because Reddit seems to be the only place I can talk freely.    
    
I am so lost I don’t even know how to explain it.     
   
When I lost the only guy I had ever loved some six years ago, it really ripped my soul out. I never recovered from that. All the ambition, the positive thinking, the effort and the goals in my life just vanished.     
I kept on going through the motions for a while, but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum. Just enough to stay afloat. For a while I could live off that.     
But then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself, and the bare minimum became a struggle.     
It’s not that I couldn’t do more – I was, and am, capable. It’s just not in me. I have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I fear waking up, and cry every morning when I do.    
I am not pining for some guy anymore. I don’t even have the motivation to do that – it’s like I’m completely empty. I just don’t feel anything except this big heavy stone. It’s like everything that I was full of drained out of me, and there’s nothing left.    
I have, technically, a boyfriend. But he’s worthless – there’s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label. When I try to tell him how hopeless I feel… if I dare use the word “depressed,” then there’s hell to pay. A locker-room pep talk that starts with “you’re a worthless piece of shit! Do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever? Fight!” and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house. Eventually he calms down and apologises but then it’s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam. Nothing ever changes. Nothing gets better.     
And everything just keeps getting worse.    
    
Now, I can’t make this month’s rent.     
    
I was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour, dreading going back home. Not because of a boyfriend I am so indifferent to that I can’t bother to dump him, not because of a rent that’s only a few hundred dollars low, not because of a dying industry that I might as well just change… but because of the thought that even if I do go home, even if I do go to sleep and wake up in the morning, it will be just as bad as it was yesterday, and will only get worse.    
    
I have been contemplating suicide for more than three years, but last night was the worst for a long time. I have researched it thoroughly, but can’t find a feasible, painless, quick solution. The pain terrifies me – the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation. Guns aren’t available in this country. I have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death. Perhaps the best option I have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run…. I heard you just go to sleep.    
    
But I know that I didn’t jump on the tracks last night, and I haven’t taped up my car windows just yet, and for some reason I am here typing this long, long note out. So something in me – soul or no soul - doesn’t want to give up just yet. I don’t know what to do.     
    
...I think that when I wake up tomorrow morning, if I don't feel any better, I will just go ahead and jump. The station is only a five minute walk through the park. It only gets worse from here, anyways.
        
       
       
**edit:** When I woke up this morning, the first thing I did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice. And I burst into tears. Seriously. I have never felt so protected, so warm, and so safe in any community as I do here.

We were a good couple, with so much love for each other. We were each other’s everything. Whenever I had anxiety or was simply sad, the only thing that helped was his hugs and kisses. Now he’s not here anymore, he’s just ashes.

My friends got worried about me and got me committed against my will at a short term mental hospital and I just got out today, 12 days after his death.

I miss him with every fibre and molecule and atom of my being. It’s physically painful, insufferable. I can’t think about anything else.

I tried overdosing on Xanax with alcohol but I didn’t have enough, and when I woke up the next day I was so disappointed. This was before the hospitalisation. During the hospitalisation I was ok, better than now. But I don’t want to go back there, the place was awful.

The only reason I’m not attempting a new OD this very second is that it would kill (figuratively) my parents. Everyone would be sad. And I can’t do that to them. But at the same time, my love is never coming back and he’s all I want. All I need. NEED with every cell in my body. It physically hurts.

786,b3otfs,False,None,22,My sister's suicide this week.,SuicideWatch,"I’ve never posted here before, but I thought I’d share my story due to events that happened this week. I am Sophia’s younger brother (I have two older sisters, as well), and I am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at. This is her Reddit account which she made this month: ([https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini](https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini)). I was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since I last met her in September 2018, and it’s unfortunate that I was not given the chance to contact her, as I have autism and depression too. I had no idea that she tried to run away before I contacted her on her birthday this month; she actually responded “Thank you, love you always!”, just two weeks ago from today.

&#x200B;

We had our fights and arguments in the past, but we sincerely amended this last year, and we enjoyed our older sister’s wedding together (when we went abroad in August 2018). I genuinely believed she would come home for the Easter holidays in a few weeks, as I accepted that she didn’t want to come home for Christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies. This tragedy has brought the family closer together: I had a heart-to-heart with my father, who I thought didn’t understand my emotions or cared enough about them; I vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family; I promised that if I ever felt like this, I would get in-touch immediately; I contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again. I have been taken aback by all the supportive comments I received, even from people I never really spoke to that I assumed didn’t care for me.

&#x200B;

She was proud of me, because, last year, on the drive back home from the airport, she told me I had overcome so much, in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since 2015. I don’t want the same fate as her, because I feel responsible for this world, regardless of how much evil is committed every day, and I want to change it for the better in my life. Aside from the times that we fell-out, I tried to socialise with her, as she usually locked herself in her room and played music. I gave her documents that she requested me to print-out; I asked if she wanted to play Smash Bros. (I tried to teach her how to play, and I remember the time that I had a 300% handicap and still won); I asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me (Steven Universe, Invader Zim, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil, etc.). I respected her decision to focus on her studies (I would have done the same), and I thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer, after finishing her undergraduate degree.

&#x200B;

Whenever the funeral service is planned, I intend to sing ‘Love Like You’ (the credits theme from Steven Universe), in-front of all the attendees. She couldn’t get into the show from watching the first five episodes (she thought it was too goofy), but she liked the songs from the show, even from episodes she hadn’t seen before. I remember she was listening to ‘Stronger Than You’ and ‘Dear Old Dad’ whilst studying at home. Thank you for all the memories, and I won’t let you down.

Now obviously, I didn't die. But it feels like I am. After about an hour I got dozy, had a hard time keeping my head up and stuff. I wasn't scared, I wasn't sad I was just so groggy. Ten minutes after that my stomach began to ache.

For half an hour I threw up stomach acid violently. I felt like I was going to pass out, so I went to my room to lay down, hell I should've gone to a hospital. The dizziness got worse and I was gagging constantly. I couldnt lay down without hurting, I couldnt sit up without falling down and standing up out of the question.

Here's why:

Every piece of bad news / bad situation / bad choice / bad decision that has come my way has resulted in some REALLY GREAT shit coming my way after I recovered from it. 

Looking back, if it wasn't for all those bad situations, all the great shit that followed after recovery would likely never have happened. 

I've made so many mistakes, failed so many times, lost so much money on bad decisions, made a complete fool out of myself in front of so many people, been so completely and totally embarrassed.. until one day I learned the secret..

Successful people understand that with each piece of bad news some really great stuff is going to come out the other end.

The attitude is ""well I completely fucked this shit up, so some really amazing shit is going to happen, I know that""

The problem with most people is recovering from your fuck ups.

Successful people recover in days, some people it takes weeks, average people it takes years or never. 

I ran the first two businesses I ever start right into the fucking ground. 

One after the other.

I'll admit it took me MONTHS to get over that,

To ""recover"".

But I started thinking about where I went wrong.

Started reading all the business books I could get my hands on.

And I learned from my mistakes, recovered, and tried again.

And some really great shit came out the other end!

In the early 2000's a prominent wall street executive was arrested for insider trading. Turns out he was giving his stripper/mistress stock tips which she then went and told her friends and they all invested and profited off. 

He gets arrested, loses his job, wife leaves him and takes the kids, and he gets sentenced to a couple years in prison.

Now when the cops are putting on the cuffs, theres no way you can convince this guy that this bad news is actually good news.

But as it so happens, on Sep 11th 2001, a plane crashes right into his office at the world trade center killing all 68 of his employees. And if he had not been arrested, he would have been right there with em on that day.

Now being arrested, having your wife leave, losing your jobs, etc aint such bad news..

95% of all the ""bad"" shit that happens to you is going to turn into some really amazing shit when you recover from it.

The only caveat is terminal illness, like *tomorrow*, gone.

Remember.. All news, is good news. ",2018-05-07 08:56:51

Yesterday I intended to kill myself. My ex/roommate (it's complicated) caught me in the middle and called my wife to come home from work to keep an eye on me. When my wife got home she practically ran over to me and hugged me. She was trying so hard to hold herself together and be strong, but I could feel her whole body shaking.

She sat with me and we talked for awhile about nothing in particular. Just talked, joked, and laughed like we do. But even half an hour later I could still feel her hand trembling as she held mine. She was outwardly keeping it together so she could be there for me, but inside she was a wreck. Later, when I went up to our room to sleep, she had put one of her adorable stuffed animals on my pillow. It was such a small gesture, but it  made me feel loved.

I knew she would be sad, but I still underestimated how much she cared. I don't know if I'll ever forget that feeling. I don't think I should.

I wanted to share this for anyone else out there who thinks like I do. I was wrong. You might be too.

I read that Alan Turing, who was a brilliant computer scientist and responsible for saving millions of lives during World War 2, was forced to be chemically castrated for being gay. His hormones got fucked up and took away all joy in his life, his thirst for knowledge, and eventually made him take his own life. Was he weak? No, but defeated, chemically and without purpose.

We're told suicide is selfish. But if it is so selfish, why do people abandon you at your lowest and leave you to deal with what seems insurmountable at the time all alone? Where were they when they proclaimed that suicide is a selfish act when you were going weeks-months in pain trying to fix a mess without any support?

Nobody wants to hear your problems. If you bring them up they will tell you to hopeful things with empty words then disappear for a while. Life's short, you fuck up and are in it alone then good luck. People will always remember your wins, but when you talk about mental health all of a sudden it gets weird and stigmatized.

816,1zrrrw,False,None,34,How I found my older brother commited suicide,SuicideWatch,"I am 26 years old right now, and not a day goes by where I don't think about my older brother. People used to ask me when I was a kid if I had any siblings and I would always point to my older brother and say ""He's my brother"". 

Now I just say I'm an only child and leave it at that. Half of my friends don't know I had a brother, because I don't want to mention it. 

Well, here goes the story that I never told anyone before. Me and my older brother were like two peas in a pod. We used to do everything together. Play sports, watch movies, and like other brothers, we used to fight. But with every fight, we always had the gift of being able to make up with each other and still be brothers that love each other. 

I used to say rude things to him, I used to call him a jerk and a mean person, but I never really meant it. 
So my brother was 18 years old when he was dead. I remember he was unusually quiet the days before his suicide, and he was complaining about something to dad, that I never really know what until I later realized it was about anxiety. 

He taught me how to make something called paper airplanes, where you got paper and made them into airplanes. It was fun, I used to get paper airplanes and throw them to his room and see how far It would land, and then he would get some paper and shoot it back at my room every morning. 

Every other morning he would shoot a paper airplane at my room when I was just waking up. Sorta of our way of saying good morning to each other.

So one day, I woke up. I looked around and there was no paper airplane in my room. I guess I slept longer than him, but I never do. He usually wakes up at like 7 am in the morning. I checked the time and it was 11 am. 
I made a paper airplane and threw it at his room. 
He would usually show himself and play tackle me or tickle me when I did but no one came out the room. I opened the door fully and he wasn't in his bed. 

That's when I looked around and saw the paper he used to make paper airplanes out of, it was all neat and nothing was really ripped apart or touched like it usually was. 

I saw the closet was mildly open and that's when I saw the same image that sticks with me to this very day. I saw my brother in the closet with his eyes mildly open mildly closed, and his face with a pale expression, almost like a frown. I remember his skin color looked odd. I thought he was just standing at first but he was a bit taller. I saw something was holding him up and then I saw the little rope by his throat holding him up. I didn't know what he was doing, I thought it was a prank he made to scare me. I touched his chest and then pushed him. I then started yelling and pushing him violently and then screamed for my mom and dad. By then tears were on my eyes.

But I can tell you right now, if I had to choose something that tore me apart more... My brother's lifeless body or my parents reaction to it, I would have chose parents reaction. 

My dad came into the room, followed by my mom, and for some reason I just didn't want to be in that room anymore and I let myself out to the hallway. Then I heard screaming of my brother's name from my mom, and then some type of noise. I think it was my dad pushing my brother's body, like me. They started sobbing. I went to peek back in the room and then I saw my dad shaking and whimpering. He was a tough guy he never cried in any sad movies me, my brother, and him used to watch together but he was crying nonstop. My mom was just standing there with her lips quivering... her teeth shaking, and her eyes were red. I didn't notice it but I was crying too. My whole body was shaking. 

I ripped up all my paper in my room and I felt like throwing up and spitting out my insides, I then just sat down in my bed for seemingly hours. I never wanted to leave the room, and all I could think about was if this was some sort of nightmare that I was in. I tried going like the cartoons and pinched myself, I used my nails to cut myself deep in my skin to wake me up, I scratched harder till there were marks on my arms but I never woke up. I never woke up.

Every night now, I always wonder what my brother would be like when he was around my age now, and if he would have had a family by now. 

Every year on the day of my brother's death, I throw a paper airplane to a river, and every day I would hope to wake up in my room with a paper airplane lying in my bed, from my older brother.

829,ed12ze,False,None,29,Not expecting much from here. Even the crisis hotline counselor was speechless,SuicideWatch,"I just need to vent.

I'm a single gay man in my late 30's. Seen multiple mental health professionals over the years. Been there, done that. Have a couple of college degrees. I don't drink or do drugs.

I always prided myself with employment yet struggled to find meaningful employment. I found myself working with autistic children and public service which I liked, but it's not a stable job. I had a period of unemployment a few years back and did something stupid things that led to a criminal investigation (not important what). Realizing that my career working with kids and in government was over, I quickly landed a job in corporate America.

Then I was charged and after a lengthy discussions between my lawyer and the DA, I got five years probation and two suspended sentence. I was doing well despite being a felon because no one knew - my job, my neighbors, my family. A year into probation, I got violated for having a bullet. Ironically, I had purchased a gun in case I was facing serious time. So I went to prison for two years. It was awful. There was nothing rehabilitative about it. While everyone talked about getting high once they got out, I talked about getting a job.

I was released early and sent to a halfway house in the hood. I found an accounting job at a small business that did not do a background check. A year later, it went out of business. I said ""fuck it"" and started applying for those high-paying corporate jobs and would try to beat a background check. It worked. I landed the highest-paying job I ever got. With health insurance too. It was a lot of work, but worth it.

Lately I had been feeling suicidal. Burned out. Anxious. Overwhelmed. The one thing that kept me going was my job. It took up most of my time and gave me financial peace (which is underrated).

Then I got fired today.

Not sure what happened, but three months into the job and passing my background check, they fired me for lying. It's beyond me how they found out. I think a co-worker found out and dropped a dime on me. I was a good worker. I left feeling ashamed, degraded, defeated, etc. I can't do this again. It's not like there was good jobs for a middle-age felon. That's a lie. Been through all the social services designed to help people like me and they didn't and couldn't help. It had to be up to me.

To keep on trying to make it is senseless. It's insanity.

I called a crisis hotline and laid it all onto the counselor. He was speechless and all he could say is how it must be tough and offered to call me in a few days. I wasn't expecting anything.

I think he understood. Killing myself is the only thing that has made sense to me in years.

I've been keeping it all in me for so long and it feel like a relief. I thought about killing myself only after my mom dies, but truth be told I have been and am in too much pain and it's not fair to me. I'd rather die and leave my savings to her. I feel bad for anyone that feels like they let me down or could have done something (they couldn't or wouldn't).

There is this part of me that fears death less. What I fear is my future. At least death is inevitable.

Again, not expecting anything life changing on here. The next few days will be brutal. I have crossed a point of no return today.

831,cd8n23,False,None,19,My sister told me to kill myself,SuicideWatch,"My sister and I used to be best friends. But I noticed as when she grew older, she started to develop a ""grudge"" against me. She got angry at me more easily, and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone. I tried to connect with her because I still loved her, but she would shut me out of her life. And because of this, my sister and I haven't spoken to each other in three months.

My sister was up at 4:00 am today and I couldn't sleep so I went to her room and told her to go to bed. She started yelling at me while mom heard her, and went upstairs. As soon as she reached her room, she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed.

Five minutes after that happened, I heard a voice in the dark say, ""I hate you. I wish you would die. Go kill yourself.""

I realized that it was coming from my sister's room. I got up and said, ""What? What did you just say?""

""I hate you. I wish you would kill yourself. Just die already.""

I didn't know why she was saying this, so I started crying and went downstairs. My heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy.

I told my parents everything, and my mom went upstairs again to confront her. My dad stayed with me, and held me as I cried. He said that he was very disappointed at her (even though she was his favorite).

Mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning.

She never did. In fact, she pretended that *nothing* ever happened. She pretended that I didn't even exist. She was happy.

The worst part, was how my sister *knew* I was suicidal. Back when she was ""nice"", I told her about my feelings and how I wanted to kill myself, and she shared my sympathy. Now, she shames me because of it. She shames me for being depressed and tells me that I was a mistake and blames me for my parents' suffering. She told me that I was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite. She told me that she hated me everyday.

This morning, I tried to hang myself with my dad's belt, but I failed.

Now I have to wake up everyday, knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone.

did great at school and was a happy and active kid until highschool when all the pressure to excel became overwhelming and I started having anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn't focus anymore and started giving up on school, stopped doing all activities I used to love and harmed myself. 

started having suicidal thoughts and a year after I attempted. felt a little better after some hospitalization, but talking to a psychologist made me realize even more how more fucked my life was and i started self harming again and stopped showing up to appointments.

 I feel invalidated when I talk about those thoughts to him, especially if the reason is something small. I usually also get shut down immediately with “that’s not you that’s thinking these things, it’s the thoughts” or “that’s not what you want”, or better yet, “that’s dumb/stupid.”

I’m up at college right now, it’s my third semester. Things haven’t been easy for me. I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder. All my roommates have gone home for the holidays, they finished their finals yesterday and I still had one more to do today. 

I’ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues. I recently changed my major to geology from accounting. My mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family (4 out of the 7 kids in her family are accountants). My dad is an economics major. They don’t see any value in geology at all and so we’ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life. This, however, isn’t the first time my family has feuded with me. I’m sort of the black sheep of the family. Anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling, they refuse to give me their SSN for my Federal student aid application, and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill I’m declared a dependent and my university can’t override my FAFSA application. I tried to get a loan with my bank where I have my own independent account, but they said a co-signer is required for my loan. My parents refuse to sign it. I reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and I shouldn’t worry about going home (my brother and I go to the same university). 
I wrote my suicide note and I was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication (Paxil). Everything felt entirely perfect. I was alone in my apartment, done with schooling, all of my friends had gone home, it felt right. But right as I went to get a glass of water, someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door. 

I answer the door (my Paxil bottle in my hand still) and there’s a girl I’ve seen once or twice around. She says “hey (my name), all my roommates are gone and I was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie. I’m an extrovert so I just feel weird doing stuff alone.” 
I don’t think she knew what was happening, but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from God. Like maybe God or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive, even though everything seems awful right now. After she left I sobbed and it felt like everything just changed— like a light switch went off.

We have no idea what the motivation is for these reports, but this is a dangerous and ill-advised practice for the following reasons:

1. Reporting a post increases the probability that it will be snagged by the reddit spam filter.  This is entirely outside the moderators' control.

2. The criteria for these reports seem to be pretty random, and [do not correspond to established, evidence-based risk assessment criteria](http://redd.it/1c7nqf).

3.  Most of the reported posts have had some good, supportive responses, so there doesn't appear to be any special action warranted on the part of the moderators.  

4.  What it says in the sidebar is true - we don't have the resources to trace the source of any post, but we fear that this is what our anonymous reporter is expecting.  So we'd like to point out that ""outing"" someone can actually increase the inherent risk in a situation rather than decreasing it, especially in the long term, by discouraging them from opening up about their feelings.  Involuntary interventions are almost never necessary, and almost always traumatic.  It's important to remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention.  It saves far more lives than it costs.  The times when outing someone is the safer choice are the rare exceptions, as when someone gets entangled in a safety harness and needs to be cut out of it.

852,ndlxt,False,None,22,Attempted suicide two years ago. Just got Facebook timeline and saw something...,SuicideWatch,"I attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever."" I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

"" Brudder! Are you alive? :) ""

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was. If I had killed myself, I would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.

If you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.

The internet is a scary place however real life isn't much better. I like Reddit because it is mostly anonymous, you could be my best friend, my cousin, my brother and not know whose post you were reading and I like that because some things you just don't want people to know. People in my life know I'm falling apart but they don't know quite how bad it is, how messed up and broken I am I mean fuck, they thought I was over everything that happened a few years ago but little do they know it still catches up to me every once in a while, makes me break down crying. Anyways, I feel like on Reddit it's hard to picture users as actual people so I'll set the scene slightly. Hey, I'm Scarlett and I'm currently living in the UK. I suffer from a lot of mental illnesses and honestly I've grown up ignoring my diagnosises because if I'm being honest, I don't care. My friends have no idea that I suffer from bipolar either and it's fucking hard to keep that one to yourself but I'm trying my best. It feels like every day i feel worse and worse and I just hurt myself more and more. I don't really see a point for me to carry on anymore, I'm a burden to every one I know and I'm so fucking greatful that they put up with my shit And smile even though they have their own stuff going on and I just wanted to say thank you. There are so many reasons I don't want to be here anymore but in reality, does it even matter what the reasons are? I don't plan on living much longer and if I don't have time to write a note then I guess this is it. I'm sorry for wasting your time, hope you are all having a nice day, and remember, it may be too late for me, I have made up my mind but life is beautiful and I hope that whatever your going through, you find a way to get through it.

Murder, Suicide, Gun violence, child involved, cheating, news making a mockery of tragedy.
Names are all fake.

I (25F) have two younger brothers. We (me, Mike (23M), and Max (17M) all have different fathers. We’ve never lived with Mike’s dad, but he’s been a father figure to us throughout our lives.

Now comes the awfulness.

Last night one of my father figures, did a terrible thing. He shot and murdered two people, and then he turned the gun on himself.

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

- - - - - 

“Dan” was a good person. He was a great biological father to my middle brother “Mike”, his other 3 children, and a father figure to me as Mike’s older sister. I was a 10 month old baby when Dan met my mom. A little over a year later, my little brother Mike (age 23) came along. Dan (60s) and my mom (40s) didn’t stay together, but he was always good to us throughout our lives.

And then this.

Dan had a long-term girlfriend, “Rachel”. Dan recently found out that Rachel has been cheating on him for a period of time, and last night he hit his absolute breaking point. Dan wanted Rachel out of his house, and she refused to go. Apparently she paraded around in front of him, wearing the sweater of the man she’s with on the side; basically flaunting the cheating and telling Dan that he’s becoming an old man, that she can do better, have any guy she wants, but due to current circumstances he has to let her stay and support her. She’s telling him all of this, meanwhile my father figure is trying to keep his temper. He tells her to get the hell out of the house. He tells her that he’s had enough. We can tell he’s losing control at this point.

That’s when Dan’s older son Bill (age 26 and Mike’s biological big brother) gets in the middle. Bill tries to settle his father down, and get Rachel to shut up because everyone can tell Dan is at his boiling point. They don’t. At this point, Bill says he has had enough and is going to take his girlfriend and his 3 year old son “Eli” and move out and leave the house, because they can’t stand the fighting. Because they need to support Eli, Bill and Megan were going to move out anyway. Bill hoped that this would snap them to their senses; but Dan tells him to go. Bill leaves.

That’s when things got worse. 

Rachel keeps screaming and taunting Dan. The others are scared and frozen. Dan pushes Rachel into the wall, and starts hurting her. Megan calls Rachel’s brother because Dan is getting violent and everyone is terrified but scared to get in the way. Rachel’s hitting Dan and scratching at him; screaming she doesn’t love him and he has no right to touch her, that she has every right to be here as Dan is grabbing at her, shoving her into the wall and towards the door. Megan calls Rachel’s brother for help, because the situation is deteriorating and we are all afraid Dan will really hurt her because he’s much bigger.

Rachel’s brother gets there instantly from a few doors down. The brother gets in the middle, taking Rachel’s side, defending her actions. It doesn’t help. Dan leaves the room fuming....we’d never seen him so angry.....and comes back with a shotgun loaded. 

The first shot goes off, and hits Rachel in the stomach. She collapsed with blood everywhere, Megan grabs baby Eli and runs upstairs; and Rachel’s brother runs for the door. He makes it out of the house and partway down the drive, into his van, before Dan shoots him in the chest and he dies instantly. Then....then Dan comes back into the living room. He levels the shotgun at himself.... and then shoots himself in the head.

Meanwhile, Megan has barricaded herself upstairs with the baby and calls Bill (the older son, and her boyfriend), and 911. The police run in and Bill gets there right about the same time; running inside to get his girlfriend and son. He’d only been gone for like 5 minutes. 

Just 5 minutes.

The police run in, and check on everyone. Rachel is still alive; so a Lifeflight is called in for her. We heard she died en route to the hospital in the helicopter. 

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

My little brother is an absolute mess. The news vans and newspapers are making a mockery of what happened, swarming like vultures wanting to use our tragedy for entertainment. Horrible sick people. Someone said something about publishing this in the paper, and one of the family members nearly got arrested for punching the guy. Everyone is hysterical. 

The police have already ruled it a Murder/Suicide. 

My little brother Mike is a mess, my mom is a mess, and I’m trying so hard to be strong. Mike can’t understand why his father would do that. Why he’d shoot two people and then turn the gun on himself....taking the cowards way out. The suicide was so brutal that the police would not allow the family to identify the body. 

Luckily, Mike’s older brother Bill, the girlfriend Megan, and little Eli is okay. But we are all damaged. How will anything ever be okay again? 

This is SENSELESS.

I’ve been awake all night at my moms comforting my brother and being with family. Now I’m collapsed at my fiancé’s, just taking it all in while he holds me tight. I’ve already put an email in to my therapist. Sorry about the crappy writing, and if this is difficult to understand; it’s a complicated situation and I’m barely functioning.

Is it selfish because of the people who care about you? Well, how is me living a life I don't want to just to comfort their lives not selfish from them? Moreover, what about the people who have no one to care for them?(Not my case, but still, it's quite a common cause of suicide)

Is it cowardly? I really don't think so. Every little inch of your body tries to stop you from doing it, so coming to the decision, and moreover actually doing it takes a lot of courage and determination.

Do things get better? Well, what if they fucking DON'T? For years, I keep hoping to get to a better life, to start properly enjoying it, but it just doesn't work out. I even moved to a different country, hoping for a new(and better) life. Truth be told, I'm just not meant to live a good life. I don't know, maybe I was a massive asshole in a past life(if that's a thing) and now karma is working its way.

People are so hypocritical, I swear. They all use the ""my body, my choice"" argument to support transgender people(and more others, but this was the first that came into my mind), yet they fail to acknowledge that this principle works exactly the same for suicidal people. I never asked for this. If(well, obviously hypothetically speaking) I could have gotten a choice whether to be born or not, I might have just said no, so I should have a right to end my miserable existence whenever the hell I want. After all, I have a RIGHT to live, not an obligation to do so. Huge difference.

*edit*: In all fairness, I have to admit that there are situations in which suicide is kind of a dick move. For example, if you have children which still depend on you, killing yourself would more or less ruin their future. So yes, in that case, I disagree with suicide. However, I'm single and I don't have any kids(or any other person whose life depends on me other than myself), so offing myself would not affect anyone in the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/80vyt3/why_is_suicide_so_bad_anyway/,188,"Life is an absurd joke.

I’m young, 17, and I understand there’s so many years that I could have, I just don’t want them. I’ve contemplated suicide a few times over the years, I’m sure everyone has, but it was always a fleeting thought, now it’s constant. 
I just lost a parent, I’m in so much pain, not just mental, mostly physical actually. I live with health conditions that leave me in pain every second of every day, no matter what I do. The odd thing is, I’m not depressed, I deal with crippling anxiety, but not so much depression. 
I’ve been in therapy for a couple years now, she’s an amazing therapist, I genuinely couldn’t ask for anything more, she has tried very hard. The only time I’ve ever admitted wanting to die is last week, I regretted saying it immediately, she asked a couple questions, I answered honestly but told her I didn’t want to say anything else as I was scared she would tell my mother and I would be committed. She said she didn’t have to break confidentiality unless she suspected I was a danger to myself, doing things like stockpiling, planning etc. 
so obviously I didn’t admit that I had been doing those things, because I don’t want to be stopped. 
I honestly don’t understand why we try so hard to save people that don’t want to be saved. If someone wants to die, and they are so determined that they will do whatever it takes to make it happen, let them do it. At least they’d be able to go out with some shred of dignity. I’ve set a date to do it multiple times, and then backed out at the last minute, but tonight’s the night, I’m done backing out. I was scared this morning, and then counted how much I had stockpiled and was suddenly so relieved and for the first time in a while, felt excited. I can’t wait to go to sleep and not have to wake up resentful that I’m waking up. 
I feel bad that my family will have to find me, but not bad enough that I’m not going to do it.

So I had an older brother. I had one. He was always depressed. He even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. That happened about 2 years ago (I was 14, I’ve recently turned 16). One month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. He then shot him self in the head. I rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. Since then I’ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and I am extremely depressed. Everytime I close my eyes I see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. I have multiple panic attacks everyday. I don’t want to talk to my friends or family(by „talk“ I mean communicate not literally talk.). I can’t do this anymore. Im sitting with a knife next to me. I don’t know if I should do it.

In 2016 I was raped. It was the hardest time in my life, and I attempted suicide then. Clearly I survived and am still here. 
Tonight I just found out that the girl who I’ve been best friends with since we were in elementary is engaged to the boy who raped me. 
And yes she knows he raped me. She is very aware of the fact. 
It turns out she has been hooking up with him since my assault.  And they are now engaged. She’s somehow kept it a secret from me (I’ve moved away for college so we don’t see each other every day like we used to) but she accidentally forgot to untag herself from a post and so I saw a post of the two of them together in Facebook. 
This is the girl who calls me her sister, says she loves me more than anyone, tells me she’ll always be there for me. 

So it hit me tonight. No one actually fucking cares about me. Clearly not. The person who claimed to have cared the most about me is marrying the man who ruined my life.

This last Saturday, I received a phone call from my wife's number. When I picked up, there was a man's voice on the other end. The first question he asked was why I hadn't already killed myself. I was taken aback at first, then he kept convincing me to do it, with my wife laughing in the background. He kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if I did so. He told me my sons wanted me to do it as well. I haven't seen them since September. They are only 7 and 6. He said they were his kids now, which made me angry and extremely upset because I am over 200 miles away from them. On Sunday, November 12th, I attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication. Before I was fully unconscious, my sister stopped by because she hadn't heard from me in over a day.

905,gbfzam,False,None,32,Why is it so fucking difficult to die?,SuicideWatch,"I never wanted to exist. I want to die. There isn't anything in this world that's going to change my mind. I don't want to get better. My mental and physical illness might actually be curable but I don't want to get better. I never enjoyed life and the only reason I am alive is simply due to my parents' selfishness and their decision to bring this misery upon me. I never asked to be born and no, life isn't a 'gift'. Life is pain, misery and dread.

I am too much of a coward man. I tried to take my life once but didn't do any research on my method so obviously, as you can see, I failed tremendously. I took a bunch of Xanax pills and downed them with alcohol hoping they'll make me go into cardiac arrest or maybe make me stop breathing...a simple google search would've saved me some time, because you need HUGE amounts of benzos in order to overdose and die...yet I went through it because it was an impulse decision so not much thought was put into it.

I woke up with a terrible headache and in a pile of vomit. I wish I had the courage to attempt it again, in a different way, but I'm too much of a pussy. That failed attempt disappointed me so much because it proved me that I'm such a failure that I can't even kill myself. I've been researching suicide methods ever since, but I just can't bring myself to do it, yet I somehow will. I need to.

&nbsp;

Looked up every single suicide method. Most of them have a high chance of survival and it can leave you crippled and even more miserable. Others, will leave you in agonizing pain for a few minutes or even hours before you die and I just don't have the guts to go for it. I am a huge coward. Who knows, maybe I'm just not ready to kill myself yet, as much as I want it??? Possibly.

Jumping in front of a train? Nope, there's a chance of living through it and suffering 100 times more. Jumping off a building? Literally same. If you're unlucky, you can jump off a skyscraper and survive (there's an actual story of some dude who fell off a 47-floor building and survived). Shooting my brains out would probably be my best deal but since I live in a shithole of a country in Eastern Europe, it's nearly impossible for me to get a gun. I'm currently doing some research on hanging since it's the most accessible and inexpensive suicide method out there and I've read that you can calculate the height of your jump in order to break off your spinal cord and die instantly. But if you miscalculate, you will either end up decapitated or you'll be awake and conscious through the whole thing and it can take you 15 minutes of unbearable pain to finally succumb to hanging. Overdosing on pills? I can't think of anything besides opiates since everything else will just fuck you up even more without actually killing you.

So what am I left with? Oh yes, opiates. Good old heroin. There's stories on the web from people who have survived heroin ODs and said that it was absolute bliss. You just go in a deep sleep and (hopefully) don't wake up. No hallucinations or paranoia or shit that you'd experience with other types of drugs. Just peace. 


&nbsp;

So I started to look for a heroin plug in my area. It's not easy living in a small city because you're out of luck. At some point, I was so desperate that I stopped giving a fuck about the risks involved and I just straight up started questioning people if they knew any heroin dealers in the area. I was met with surprised reactions, some were weirded out, some were concerned. Luckily, I'm not in prison so lucky me I guess, would be a shame to run into an undercover cop or something. Long story short, I couldn't find a dealer for the love of me. So here I am, browsing the darknet.

It took me a few weeks to learn the ropes. There's special software like Tails, Tor, PGP/Kleopatra, and the bitcoin wallet of choice. Still, no one will actually guarantee that you don't get scammed. I'm still struggling with the actual encryption of the messages so that I won't get in trouble. It fucking sucks. I just want to die and I can't understand all the unnecessary struggle I need to undergo. I wish it were as simple as going to the hospital, signing a paper and asking for a lethal shot. Yet, only a few countries around the world have legalized euthanasia and it fucking blows. I didn't choose to come into this life so why am I forced to stay?

I can't find anyone who is willing to fucking help. I have tried reaching out online, both on the clearnet and the darknet and all the feedback I've received was from people who ""want me to get better"". Why the fuck does everyone attach this special value to life? Why does everyone care about a random stranger's death so much? I don't want to live, is it a crime to hate life? It certainly seems so.

&nbsp;

There's so much stuff I'm going to risk. I thing I have found a potential vendor on the darknet who has great reviews and feedback. I'm going to order from him as soon as I figure out how to convert real money into cryptocurrency. I might just wake up with the cops knocking on my door, who knows? Maybe my pack will get seized. I might be thrown in jail since my country has stupid drug laws. Even if I DO get my hands on heroin, I know nothing about it. I don't know how to shoot up and missing a vein can lead to amputation. Can you freaking believe it? You're trying to off yourself but instead you end up with an amputated arm. Amazing. I know nothing about how to cook the heroin, how to shoot it up and how much to take. I know nothing about the purity of heroin and I might end up with some shit grade heroin that isn't going to kill me anyway. There's no fucking way to die peacefully. But anyway, I'll go through this. Not sure why I even wrote this, just needed to vent I guess.

911,bxw9gd,False,None,28,It is Likely that I’ll lose my Husband to suicide.,SuicideWatch,"We’ve been married 12 years and have 4 kids. He attempted suicide once, before we met. I should also note his father committed suicide when he was a baby. He’s been honest since we met about his mental health and I knew it was risky choosing to spend my life with him, but I was in love and naïvely thought depression could be conquered. 
Fast forward to present, my husband works in mental and behavioral health, he is very successful (constant stream of referrals to see him) He wants to help others find their way out of the darkness he often finds himself in. We’ve had lots of ups and downs with depression over the years. This Past Fall was the worst, he took a leave of absence and then ended up quitting his job. He was really down for a few months.  Finally we tried a Ketamine infusion series which worked really well. But slowly over the last few weeks the depression has come back. We tried a Ketamine treatment yesterday, but it hasn’t helped much.
He told me last night that he’s done fighting. Life is just too hard. 
I felt like in the fall I had started preparing myself for the fact that I might lose him. I was seeing a great therapist at the time, and she really helped me. But right now we dont have health insurance and financially can’t afford therapy. 
No one else really knows the extent of His depression. I feel selfish wanting him to stay, because I know he’s hurting so much, and so tired of fighting, i want peace for him no matter what that means. However the reality is if he leaves us it will devastate this family, emotionally, and financially, and I have to think about those things because I will be responsible for all the pieces, and helping our kids navigate life without their Dad. And I cannot imagine life without my soul mate. I don’t know what to do or say anymore.  I feel so scared and alone.

** thank you so much for all of your kind words, and support. This is my first post and first I thought it didn’t work, but it was therapeutic to write down how I was feeling. 

I know it sounds like I’m giving up, but truly I will fight with him as long as he wants. He knows this. He also has taught me that suicide is not the selfish act so many view it as. Depression/mental illness can truly be a terminal disease and deserves the same respect and care as terminal disease. (In my opinion) 

So I’m trying to come to terms with what might be a reality for me. 

That said, I will never regret choosing him. everyone has struggles, and depression has been the biggest one we’ve fought together. Working in mental health he has saved many lives and helped many learn to thrive in their circumstances. He’s overcome a million obstacles and been the best example to others! 

And we have a beautiful family. We have kids who understand how their brains work, and how to be compassionate. They know that their feelings and the feelings of others, no matter what they are are, valid. My kids know love and acceptance of others is the greatest virtue they can have. My husband has taught us all so many things, I am a better person, and parent because of him. And this won’t change regardless of when his battle ends. 

And for those who haven’t had someone validate their feelings of wanting to move beyond this life, just know I hear you. Keep talking to your loved ones, it is a hard thing to hear and understand if you’ve never felt that way yourself, but I am proof, it’s possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bxw9gd/it_is_likely_that_ill_lose_my_husband_to_suicide/,186,"I have some thought that I doubt will be popular but I hope they are helpful. 

1. Compassion

What Ive found most in my journey here is the almost zero level of compassion for being on the side of life's bell curve that makes one not what to play this Earth game anymore. 

Let him know you understand. Let him know how proud you are for his fight up to this point. No one, and I mean no one has ever uttered these words to me. Most just say how you can't commit suicide...instead of recognizing the effort to remain here long after it seems like the loving and compassionate thing to do is leave. 

Seriously, Let him know you are in love with him, and proud of his fight but understand him and just want peace for him. It might jus give him something to fight a little longer for. 

2. Ownership

While your fear is valid, I would take ownership of the choices that got you here and remove that stress from the debate. You chose to have this life despite admitting to its knowledge beforehand. This means you are responsible for the actions that come. 

You chose this risky behavior for the sake of love. Maybe love is what you need to look at. Maybe you gave him an extra 5 years because you loved him when other women would have broke him. Focus on what you've helped him with not your future responsibilities. No guilt. No shame. Just a life choice. 

Maybe its loving him so much to allow him to end his suffering. You signed up for this and you might be the only person to help him and show him the compassion he needs. Love is not always saying you cant kill yourself because X,Y,Z but facing difficult situation and showing love and compassion. 

3. Fix his gut

Some time ago I started on this path to fix my gut I didnt know was messed up. When I did this my depression went away almost entirely. I think almost everyone in the west has a fucked up stomach... I won't get into here for brevity but seriously... fix your gut, fix your depression... The real problem is then not being depressed or sad in anyway and still having to push thru the issue and stay here.

916,e5yjm6,False,None,64,What are you realistically supposed to do? I fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option.,SuicideWatch,"**Option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.

**Problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. They may tell people that you don’t want to know. You don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. And being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.

**Problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “The only truly suicidal people are already dead.”

**Problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. Abusive. If a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. It’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. 

**Problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. And professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. Like hell I want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. Let alone without the support of a trusted friend. I just want to be better!

**Problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. It’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. It’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.

**Problem 6:** nothing changes. Except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.

**Solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. I *am* suicidal, and if I need to prove it then so be it. 

**Solution 2:** you commit suicide. People get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had. After all, in the end the problem was your existence; not all problems have solutions. Minimize damage by acting now, rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e5yjm6/what_are_you_realistically_supposed_to_do_i_fail/,182,"I call it a Hamletian moment.

With death, you'll hurt people, like your parents or your siblings or your friends.'Up' as in, 'the sky's the limit.' You can only make your life better from where you're at and guess what?

928,ei2zsn,False,None,24,I’m a single mother and I want to kill myself.,SuicideWatch,"I had my daughter at 19. Her father died from cancer when she was 10 months old. I fell into deep depression and wanted to commit suicide. But I convinced myself to keep living until my daughter turned 18. I had nothing at the time, but I was determined to give her the best life until then.

I am now 33. And in those 14 years, I worked my ass off. I was working 2 jobs, while also attending college. I eventually graduated and landed a job that pay well. After a few years I saved up enough money to buy a house. I even put money aside for her college fund. So by the time she turn 18, I would have saved enough money for her to attend a University. Despite all the struggles and barriers I faced, I finally felt content. All my hard work was finally paying off. I started to feel like life was worth living. The thoughts of committing suicide after she turned 18 began to fade.

But now that feeling of self worth is gone and depression has fully taken over again. Everything changed when my daughter turned 14. I found out that she has been sneaking out, having sex, and has been using DXM to get high. My daughter said that she became this way because...of me. Because I was too strict on her with her grades and chores. And that she just wanted to be free. I admit that I do yell at her when she slips up, and that I can be very intense. But I have never lay a hand on her. I grew up in an abusive household, so I told myself I will never hurt her the same way my parents hurt me. I told myself I will raise her the best way that I can. But I failed. I failed as her mother and I was wrong thinking I deserved to live.

I tried putting my daughter in therapy in attempt to help her. She told me she wanted to change. But it was all lies. I still found pills in her room. I even found out that she has a “trap phone”, a secret cellphone she bought from a friend with her birthday money. And she was still sneaking out in the middle of the night to meet up with boys to have sex. I feel like I completely lost her and she would be happier if I was dead. I feel useless.

929,e7jllo,False,None,48,Suddenly disabled. Husband hates and resents me. I’m alone and scared to death,SuicideWatch,"A quick explanation of my (37/F) sudden disability: I was a completely healthy, active adult. A few months ago I woke up in the morning, and the muscles all throughout my body had stopped working properly (so weak they shake). I’ve been getting worse by the week and nobody can figure out what’s wrong with me. I’m in constant terrible pain all over and I’ve gotten so frail I’m nearly bed bound. Medication isnt helping the pain or weakness. Can’t care for myself hardly at all now. 

My husband is barely taking care of things that need to be done (laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc). He just sits and games on his computer. If I mention that chores aren’t being done he starts screaming at me until I’m afraid he’s going to hit me.

It happened again today. He didn’t put laundry away, and I can’t dig through the pile to get what I need. He had just been gaming all day instead of doing chores. I’m too weak to tell the whole story but I wound up in a very unsanitary and embarrassing situation because of it. When I brought up the situation with him, he went berserk. I managed to get to my car and leave the house. But I don’t have a coat and it’s 36 degrees out. I have nowhere to go. I’m estranged from my parents due to physical abuse. And my friends have slowly abandoned me over the last few months. I’m completely alone now. I’m in so much pain I want to kill myself. And knowing I’m an unwanted burden who is doomed to a life of neglect and resentment makes me positive I should do it. I have nothing, can’t take care of myself, and I don’t belong anywhere because I’m useless. I don’t know what to do beside figure out a way to end it all. How did this happen to me..

 
EDIT: I managed to drive about 3 miles away and I’m hiding in a parking lot so he can’t find me and hurt me. I’m cold because I have no coat and no idea how to get one since stores are packed due to the holidays and I’m not strong enough to even walk to the door anyway. I’m hungry. Shaking all over from pain and fear. I don’t know what to do. I can’t even think of a way I’d be able to kill myself because I’m too weak.

931,e3nth,False,None,24,Lessons from Four Decades of Depression,SuicideWatch,"My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  I am merely looking out the window.  The first snow of winter is coming down.  It's pretty.  It's okay to live.

Since I started planning this trip, my intent had been to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge at some point during my stay. I was not planning on returning to my home country. 

I went to the bridge on the second day to scout it out. High barriers and nets prevent jumping off the ends of the bridge with land underneath, but a 4-foot guardrail is the only thing that prevents jumping off the middle of the bridge. I could have done it right then but it was the middle of the day and I was with a friend; really didn’t want to scar anybody. 

So instead, I went back last night around 8pm. I hung around near the welcome center preparing myself for a few minutes, then approached the pedestrian walkway. What I hadn’t predicted was the walkway being closed to pedestrian access at 6:30pm! I was way too afraid of getting caught by the cameras or patrol guards while sneaking over the barrier, so I headed back home and make a plan to return. 

My flight back home was at 6:30am, so I planned to leave my host’s house around 4:30am pretending to go to the airport, but actually going back to the bridge which opened at 5am for pedestrians. I set my alarm-clock for 4am and went to sleep. 

I woke up needing to pee around 2am, and the
full weight of what I was planning to do suddenly hit me. I started having major doubts about the plan working, worried about somehow surviving, chickening out while on the bridge but then missing my flight and getting stuck here, or the patrol people catching me and certifying me under a 5150. That would mean missing my flight, a huuuge medical bill since I don’t have US insurance, and a massive freak out from my family. 

So, after considering all of those factors, I cancelled the taxi I had booked for the GGB and rebooked a new one for the airport. I’m here now waiting to get on the plane. 

Moral of the story: I never thought things like barriers or nets or patrols would deter people, but I guess it worked on me. This would have been my seventh and probably final attempt, the other 6 including overdoses that ended in multi-day comas, slashing my wrists, and starving myself. I’m sure I’ll try again in the near future but for now I’m safe, so thanks, GGB, for that. I guess.

936,5mg6x4,False,None,13,I told my husband.,SuicideWatch,"I told my husband I was suicidal as expected he cried and got upset. He made me promise not to leave him. I promised him. I feel good finally asking for help, now that's it's the new year and I have health insurance I can finally get the medicine I need. Plus I had a job interview this morning that was pretty promising. Who knows maybe 2017 is the year everything turns around for me. I have a good feeling about this year. 

Sorry if this isn't the right spot for it. I just felt like I needed to share with someone. Since it was the topic of suicide I figured this was the place to post it.

Hang in there everybody.

I think, however, it is incumbent upon us to remember that while all of that may be true, it's also very likely to be coming from a place of fear and/or compassion. 

Without explicitly bringing up suicide or self harm and the like, I have had two people express more or less hypothetical-future-anger toward me if I were to do something to hurt myself.  I'm not upset or angry with them because I can understand why they would say those things, even though I don't agree with or justify them. ",2017-01-06 21:06:26
937,2g9cmu,False,None,35,A friendly reminder about PMs,SuicideWatch,"Hello all!

Lately we’ve been noticing a serious increase in the number of people inviting PMs, posting identifying information (this includes usernames on other social media sites) and generally not following the [rule regarding keeping conversations *public* unless the OP asks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)

***


So, why are we so adamant about enforcing these rules? What’s the big deal about moving conversations to PM anyway? Well, there are risks on both sides. 

**For the poster/person in distress** – there is no one to point out if you are being given bad or dangerous advice. Having multiple people comment, or even just able to read the conversation can make a big difference. When the conversation stays on the subreddit, we’re able to step in if needed. People with questionable motives are more likely to want to move to PM, since then no one can point out their inappropriate behavior or contradict them. 

**For the people commenting** – When you move to PM there can be an expectation that you will make everything better. That is an *enormous* pressure to put on a single person. Even hotline responders have people with them helping to back them up and keep them level headed. Keeping things out in the open means sharing the responsibility and letting others step in as needed. 

**For everyone** - Posting information regarding other social media accounts (your skype username, telephone number, etc) is ***not allowed*** by our subreddit or by Reddit itself. We will remove all posts that do this. 

‘But skyqween, these risks are okay with me. **Why else would I bother keeping my discussion out in the open?**’ Great question! Having your conversation visible to others isn’t just about risk management (though that is the main reason). The [90/10/1](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/) rule of the internet says that for every person posting in distress, there are roughly nine more lurking and reading the supportive comments because they aren’t comfortable making a post themselves. So, when you keep your conversation visible to others you’re also *helping others to feel less alone and misunderstood.*

##This is the bottom line:

If you are a poster in distress, we very much hope that you will choose to have a conversation out in the open. However, we recognize that some are not comfortable with this. If you’re not comfortable posting publicly there are alternatives to simply making a post asking for PMs. You are always welcome to message the mods and talk to us privately. Another avenue you might want to explore is choosing someone who has a good track record in the community that you feel comfortable talking to and messaging *them* directly. However, at the end of the day if you are a poster and feel that you must post asking for a private conversation we understand. Please just be aware of the risks going forward. 

##If you are a commenter and want to ask people to pm you despite all this – don’t. We will remove the posts when they are brought to our attention and when we find them. 
",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2g9cmu/a_friendly_reminder_about_pms/,175,"I think it is safe to assume that those who post on /r/suicidewatch are in fact looking for someone to talk to because of the fact they are feeling suicidal. I agree that one should on Reddit and everywhere on the internet be mindful of privacy concerns. However, I think the general premise that somehow a more intimate conversation between someone who is striking a chord could exacerbate the problem is pretty absurd, more likely a safer space for the poster to give more specific details to be listened to, and maybe even encouraged to contact 911. 

Finally, if none of us truly are mental health professionals and are only redditors (lets assume) from what basis can any of these conclusions be made? Let's not forget the word suicide is often not even invoked by a poster but rather merely the title of a subreddit. 

I respect your efforts to police what needs to be as supportive of an environment as possible, but to impose a rule where otherwise good judgment is called for I find a little patronizing. Otherwise reasonable people will follow their judgment and make their own personal decisions about what to do in an anonymous yet possibly serious situation, I think, rather than worry about what a moderator has imposed as a rule for some sort-of self-imagined knowledge of the greater good.

It's all a roll of the dice and it usually gets worse as time goes on. It's better to end your life and save yourself the years of torment.

I wasn't the closest to him but if I needed him he would've driven the 4+ hours away he lived from me to come help. 

He had the biggest heart.

Now he is dead at 27. Nobody is talking about it on his facebook (he only had 70~ facebook friends, but that's the kind of guy he was). 

His closest friends were my boyfriend and two of my boyfriends other friends. His funeral is on Sunday on the 31st but he doesn't get a proper funeral. There is no burial. I am pretty sure the extent of his death being honoured will be it mentioned on mass on the 31st, but not with a single brochure. 

HE WAS AN AMAZING PERSON. Literally one of the kindest hearts, and he is barely getting acknowledged and it is driving me nuts. I know that those who loved him and were close to him are acknowledging him in their hearts everyday but it is just pissing me off that nobody is talking about him.

I am a kind, sensitive person but have no cares left to give.",SuicideWatch,"I just want to get this out there, not as a cry for help but as a last attempt at some human communication before I die tonight. Why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? My self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where I can't cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. Job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.

When I was eight my dad died from cancer and I was raised by a single mother. From the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. She constantly threatened to 'run away' and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me I was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (""my life would be so much better if you were never born""). When I was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn't like the fact she had children. Another one of her boyfriends was 'permitted' to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. I would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. I have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. She is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.

I was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. The one thing I still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn't kicked in yet. I left school with straight A grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside Ivy League universities in world rankings. I wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but I didn't have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. Just before I left for college I went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. It was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and I must have looked a lot more popular than I was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. She approached *me* and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. It was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. 

I have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her I loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other's colleges on alternating weekends. I just couldn't get her out of my mind. That Christmas she introduced me to her family and I saw what a real family is for the first time. Loving, interesting conversation, day trips, vacations. The next year was like a dream. She took me to Europe and we visited fifteen countries by train, sleeping in shared hostels and having sex in public bathrooms. The second year was tougher, depression and anxiety began to consume my life but she was loving as ever. I was on a lot of medication and gradually pushed every other person out of my life but she would come to my apartment and put out the bins, buy me food for the week and help me study. I trusted only her. By the time exams came around I was in such a terrible state I turned up to precisely one of them and was told to take a year out by the university's welfare officer. I did that and tried to get better. I tried to run and exercise, see a few friends here and there but the illness was too tough to properly overcome. I was in my twenties and had never had a job, I felt pathetic in every way and strongly considered suicide, but my love for this girl kept me alive.

I returned to college and after a year of anxiety hell managed to complete my studies. The only reason I graduated was that I chose every class that didn't have a final exam, as I knew one exam would be too much pressure. Instead I had endless coursework to complete for random classes about globalisation or the history of science leaving me with a degree totally irrelevant to any industry. 

I was so lost and embarrassed in life, I had no idea how to get a job and didn't want to talk to any friends. I deleted almost everyone from social media because I couldn't stand to see their perfect lives. Once again my girlfriend came to my rescue and took me on a road trip across the US. Again, it was incredible. I asked her why the hell she was with me. She told me I was tall, handsome, intelligent and she knew that just as soon as she graduated and we moved in together I would finally be able to build the confidence I needed to succeed. She truly believed in me after all that time. I asked her to marry me. She said yes, but she wanted a perfect wedding so just as soon as I had a group of friends to attend and we were earning some money we would do it. She graduated in August and we moved in together in September. She started working at a nearby hospital and I went and interviewed for a job in retail to pay my half of the rent. I planned on volunteering, making friends and working on getting a better job this year. From September 1st to November 1st this year I no longer had depression. I was getting up every single day, going to work, coming home and making her dinner. I was fixing up a bike to travel around the city and going out for dinner once a week with my soulmate. Then she left me. She knew everything I'd been through and promised me for years that we'd be happy once we got our own place. I travelled every weekend for 5 hours each way on an old bus to keep her company, make her dinner and take her on dates. 

She has no interest on working on things and says she hasn't loved me for two years, but having someone to help her through the end of med school was 'comfortable'. These last two months have been insufferable. We still sleep in the same bed. All I wanted to do was pull my life together and show her that I'm capable of stepping up and providing us with a great life but some nights I can't help but beg. She has only become more cold and spiteful with each day. She says I'm not a real man, I'm not funny, I'm terrible in bed, she is going to bring other men home and have sex in our apartment. I guess our sex life fell into a rut but she always finished before me and I made her laugh all the time. She doesn't tidy anything in the apartment and I have to run around like an abused housewife washing dishes and cleaning up after her but I can't afford to live anywhere else and I can't go back to my mum's house. It's like a monster has replaced my beautiful angel. She says she is so happy without me and now she's gone to her parents for 10 days. They are *my* family too at this point but I'm not allowed near the house. Her dad is my closest friend other than her and is in denial that she has done this, saying she is just stressed with her new job. I haven't spoken to her for 3 days but tried phoning this afternoon with no answer. Now I have to go and spend Christmas with a family I thought I'd escaped and have barely spoken to for years.

I attacked her for it, injured her badly and ended up in a teen jail (we have that in germany, not sure if that exists elsewhere). After a few months there the guards started to sexually abuse me as well. I left my body at this point and wasn't really there anymore mentally. 

After all this, life finally looked good for me, i started a job and had my own apartment and i thought it gets better. But apparently one of my old highschool classmates then black mailed me, threatening to tell my boss about my past. I begged him not to do it, and he asked me for sex or he will leak the information. I had to oblige and took his abuse to keep my job. Police never believed me because i had no evidence. He blackmailed me in person, not digitally. I couldn't prove it. After 1 year of being his sextoy, he still leaked the info.

It makes me sick. People post on social media about how heart broken they are, add their 'thoughts and prayers are with their family' bull crap, a few hashtags and boom. They're absolved of all guilt and pain and go on with their lives. I hate society. I hate the way people make tragedy about themselves and then go on with their life.

hello reddit.
I would really like to die, because it seems like the optimist in me is completely dead. And that's a good thing, because I can't count the number of times I've planned on killing myself, only to have a tiny voice in my head go ""Just wait a little bit longer. You'll be happy someday"". I would like to kill myself, because yes, I'm a fucking pussy, and living my life despite it making any sense to do so, has gotten exhausting. I try sleeping when it feels like my head's about to blow up from the emotional stress. Let's be honest, it's only a short term solution to a long term problem. Before I ask you guys what I want to ask, let me try talking a little bit maybe. There's a tiny fucking bit of the optimist who needs to shut the fuck up.

I've been working on my dreams of making comic book stories for a little over a year now, while also working a full time job. It's been rough, and what sucks is just the country I live in, which I'm convinced has to be the worst fucking country ever. It's India. Everyone here is a giant piece of shit. Everything is conservative and rooted in tradition, and it's been hard to try to exist. Doesn't help that your country has a shit reputation online either, cuz no one wants to fucking be friends with you. What makes me empty inside, is the daily dose of demotivation I get from coworkers from my full time job (I don't have friends to depend on). It's been hell trying to manufacture my own happiness. I don't think I can properly articulate how doomed things feel sometimes

The worst days are when you're hurting and there's no one to talk to (which happens every-time I'm suicidal). When you believe the shit they tell you. I used to be a cutter, but worked on myself for a long time to stop that. It feels a lot harder to handle the pain, honestly. These last few days, I've started to gain the confidence to try to off myself.

So what I ask is this. Please advise some solid ways I can kill myself. I've been thinking about either bleeding out slowly (i would prefer going out this way) or carbon monoxide poisoning, but I have no idea how to properly pull it off.

I've been having a shut day and my depersonalization kicked in earlier. She had already gone to sleep and I was slowly drifting off until I got a call. The name was ""Papa"". I immediately woke up. My heart fucking burst and before I even accepted the call I started bawling. I say hello and I hear his voice ""Is your mom home? Can you bring her the phone I couldn't get ahold of her."" I rush down the stairs unable to see from the tears and wake mom up and hand her the phone saying it's papa. She wakes up instantly and says ""God please no"" I start crying even harder. The first words my grandpa says is ""Mom's going right now"" at that I collapsed into the fetal position and lost it. 

I can't take this. This is more painful than anything I've experienced. The cutting, the pain I felt before attempting suicide in the past, the abuse. Nothing hurts more than losing 1 of the only two people who made me feel like I mattered.

958,f5b3zy,False,None,18,"My husband died, I'm left with 6 kids 3 of which are my neice and nephews who are survivors of sexual assault. I don't want to do this anymore.",SuicideWatch,"This is going to be an extremely long post,and some of this information may seem irrelevant but it all ties together why I just don't want to carry on in this world anymore, so if you make it to the end I'm grateful you read my story. I grew up in a very emotionally abusive household with a schizophrenic mother and a narcissistic father, but I overcame the years of abusive relationships with abusive men and finally found true love in 2007 

  As the title states my husband of ten years passed away from cancer in August, just 3 days after our ten year Anniversary. He fought cancer for a good 2 years but everything happened so quickly. I was his caregiver up until hospice got involved the last 3 weeks of his life. Even at that point I did 90 percent of the work. I'm absolutely traumatized by seeing him waste away, I won't go into too many details because it makes me physically ill to remember him that way, but his tumors were wrapped around his corroded artery and he had a trach tube and a feeding tube. He couldn't speak because the tumors were everywhere in his mouth, so he had to use that stupid text to speech. 

 At this point we had our 3 children ages 2, 9, and 7.
We also had custody of a neice aged 13 and a nephew aged 15. We had them for about 7 years, due to my neice telling me during a visit that her babysitters were sexually assaulting her. I did contact social services in the county they were living in and the 3 other children were interviewed but lied and said there was no abuse. They had already been removed from the home and in foster  care for two years, but my brother and his wife were given back custody. They were scared and threatened every day, and their mother was also physically abusing them and their father too.  In hindsight I should've done more to pursue this family of molesters. When I told social services they said now that my neice was in another county it wasn't worth reporting it and because it would be traumatic to my neice to be interviewed. I have a tremendous amount of guilt for not telling them to fuck off and calling the cops. As the saying goes; hindsight is 20/20. Several months later my brother left his emotionally and physically abusive wife (mind you I was still unaware and very much in denial about his part in this). They all came and stayed with us, my brother and his 3 other children. I found out months later after giving my brother a free place to live he was speaking and visiting his abusive wife the entire time. Once asked to leave he ended up taking his younger two boys and leaving his oldest son with us. I'm kind of unsure why that was the case, but that's what happened. 

My neice went through rough times, lots of bed wetting and attention seeking behavior. She was also extremely mean to my daughter who would've been 3 at the time. I feel like she learned to start problems with people and play victim because that's what her mom did. So many unhealthy behaviors that rubbed off on my daughter. I should have gotten her into therapy right away, but I guess I kind of thought she had talked to me about it and kind of moved on. 

My nephew has always been pretty well behaved, and had some anger twords me for not swooping in earlier to save him. He has always completely shut down when it comes to any sort of emotions. He's a very good kid in general but definitely angry.  Again we had to try and help them unlearn this learned behavior. The swearing and the threats of killing people. 

Fast forward to 2017 when my husband was diagnosed with his cancer. Again, I just can't go into too many details because it's still too painful. It was a solid two years without any intimacy and again me being his caregiver not his wife. It was okay though, all of it because I had something people only dream about. True, unconditional fucking love. I would do it a million times over if I had too. Again though, I have so much guilt for not spending more time with him, but there were 5 kids that needed to be cared for. Slowly all the kids drifted farther and farther away from dad, because I think it was too scary for them to see. The only one who didn't was the youngest, she didn't see cancer guy, she just saw dad. I think she kind of got him through the really, really tough times.  

After my husband passed away, I was not invited to partake in the writing of his eulogy by his family, because according to his mother, I was in no state to contribute, was I? I was really shoved aside by his parents and aunts, but more specifically his mother. To this day she doesn't call or try to see her grandkids, the only remnants of her son. It breaks my fucking heart to see this, I'd be fine never seeing her again, but wtf why don't you see the kids? My husband was a man of very strong faith, and very selfless so he knew he was going to a better place and he felt terrible that he was going to have to leave us. All the children also go to a private school, which now I'm very grateful for. At the visitation and the funeral the kids went right up to him and touched him and said ""daddy's not even in there anymore, he's in heaven."" As someone who struggles with faith, I'm okay with this. The little kids need that faith right now. 

Fast forward about 5 months and my nephew Sean comes for a sleepover, it's Christmas break, so he keeps asking every night if he can sleep over. Alright dude, that's cool, but what's up? Why don't you want to go home? Turns out both parents are physically abusing him, and the emotional abuse every day all day is enough to break the strongest of people. Alright, I'm calling your dad, I will do whatever it takes to keep this kid safe. Throughout all this my brother who's been tn the methadone program for several years finds his wife has been shooting meth for 6 months but hadn't noticed? Things were okay, Sean is openly gay which is fine with me but he also has an extremely foul mouth which I've had to reign in constantly.  Now there's this strange shift in my nieces behavior, and by now she's been in therapy for several months because she said she was suicidal. But it's a really bad shift in her. She's even more spiteful and bitchy and mean to the little kids. And her and Sean are trying to share a room, and I say absolutely not. I sense a very unhealthy connection between those two. A strange co dependency I've never before seen. 

Over this time my neice Kailey decides to come out to me as gay. Okay, that's fine. But are you gay or are you wanting to fit in or get attention. I apologize if that statement offends anyone but I know her and this is the polar opposite of her normal boy crazy behavior. My oldest nephew has been lost in all of this drama between Kailey and Sean. They fight eachother, Kailey beats up all the little kids and is frankly out of control with her behavior. I think Sean coming here has triggered something in her. Something very unhealthy. I believe that not only were her and Sean made to perform sexual acts on these male and female babysitters but also on eachother. I don't know what to do. They must be carrying around a huge weight of shame even though it isn't their fault. My goal is to get Sean into therapy so we can figure some of this out. 

I feel like I've failed my children. Everyone says they need structure, but wtf does that look like when there's six of them and one of me. I have realized every single one of them take advantage of and are very rude to me. I'm tired, tired of missing my husband, tired of going through the motions but just wanting to not be here anymore. I resent mostly my neice for coming here and really affecting my children's behavior in a negative way. I resent my husband for leaving me all alone. I resent my own children because I have to stay on this fucking earth because they need me. I often fantasize how I would die. I wouldn't want them to find me because it would be awful for them. I think about hanging and the second before I kick that stool out I text my friend telling her to get the kids from school and that I'm ending it all. My oldest nephew completely shuts down and won't say a word. His anger is real, one day he pushed me so hard I fell and hit my head very hard. His guilt and shame was immediately apparent. But the realization was holy shit, this kid could beat the shit out of me. I'm working on getting everyone else in therapy (my two nephews and my daughter). My son has been going since before his dad died because he has childhood anxiety and depression and hdhd. 

I'm not a nice mother, I yell and I swear and I ask them wtf is wrong with them for them to act this way. I do feel like as much as they love me, they would be better off without me. They always worry about me, and I would like them to not bear that burden. Every morning I wake up with more and more anxiety, I take .5 mg kolonopin to help  slow down my mind. Sometimes I think I'm just not meant for this world, there's just too much pain and the monotony of every day doesn't help. I'm absolutely lost. Every day the urge to die is stronger. I'm not even afraid anymore. The last few weeks I have truly realized how terrible things are. How awful the kids treat eachother and treat me, how they don't even hear my yelling anymore. How I'm cleaning up after everyone, everyday because nobody helps me. It's like, at first the kids were what got me through and kept me going, but now I feel like anger and sadness is just hurting them. I feel ready to die, but for now I'm going to leave it  in the cruel hands of fate. I'm aware I need help, but there's no time for it. I'm too busy trying to keep these kids from killing eachother and trying to not kill myself. Idk if this was the right place to share my story, but I figured because my want to die is so strong maybe this would be the place.

965,fj9rrr,False,None,29,A moment of your time please ❤️,SuicideWatch,"Hello, Reddit

My name is Rob, and I have a life changing favor to ask. 

I have debated on making this post numerous times. However I always made an excuse to back out. I’m not sure if this is allowed here, and if it isn’t, I’m truly sorry, but this seems to be the place where I can speak directly with the kinds of people that this message is aimed at. 

This will be an extremely personal look into mental health, and the side effects of said illnesses, but this is the last shot I could come up with. Ok... with all that being said.... 

I have been medically diagnosed with multiple illnesses. Ranging from multiple personalities, to extreme anxiety, and depression. I had a physically, sexually, and mentally abused upbringing. Videogames have always been an escape for me. They used to help me out tremendously with my social disorders... I used to talk to strangers all around the world. I played Socom on PS2, Rainbow Six 3 on PC, and a ton of Xbox Live on the original Xbox.. mostly Pandora Tomorrow’s multiplayer. 

However... as years went on. I started to distance myself from any and all social happenings. Even if I had friends online I would always “go offline” to hide. On Xbox 360, Xbox One, or PS4 I always just put myself into a private party so I can’t hear anyone. 

After this went on for almost a decade... I finally decided it was time to end my life. I had done nothing for society, and I always ran from people even if they tried to help. However, this attempt would prove unsuccessful, as the belt around my neck broke before I had fully succumbed. 

I don’t have hardly any family left, or a single friend. I understand it’s my fault entirely. However... today, I’m wanting to make a positive change in my life for once. 

As someone who doesn’t get out and is scared to talk to people.. you can imagine how difficult it is to make friends. 

However, I started thinking, “the internet has millions of people... maybe this message would reach a person and we would start a meaningful friendship”.  That was my thought process behind this whole post anyway. 

Why post it here, you may ask? 

Well.... Videogames are *literally* the only thing I know. I have followed this industry my whole life. It’s the only thing I know how to talk about. So I figured... if I was to make a friend, what better place to look then on the internet ^.^

In closing: if there is a kind soul out there that would be willing to be patient and understanding with me and start slow (IE: text messaging, over voice at first) it would mean the absolute world to me.

I either feel like I am dying, or that I want to just be done with it all. Life can really feel torturous. But keep trying. After 40+ years of severe (I mean quite literally crippling) depression, I finally found that for me, Ketamine did the trick. I had taken every drug, done talk therapy, transcranial brain stimulation (TMS), but I was miserable. So miserable, in fact, that I believed I had 4 recourses left to me...Ketamine, Electro-shock therapy, a life resigned to misery, or death. After 2 treatments of Ketamine, again - this was for my body - I felt a calm and light I had never, ever had before. It helped me deal with my husband's death (he was 42), severe emotional and physical abuse I had as a child, and the fact that a horde of people abandoned/avoided me after my husband died.

969,9sd2gu,False,None,85,boyfriend of 6 years killed himself 2 months ago. I’m just done.,SuicideWatch,"title pretty much sums it up. I’ve been depressed since I was a child, have wanted to kill myself for the past decade. I’ve always felt like something was just “missing” in my brain. I’ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and fucked up pretty much every friendship I’ve ever had. I’ve gone to therapy, been on meds, was institutionalized a couple times. Nothing helps.

It’s not that I don’t love life, because I think it’s wonderful and grand. I’ve traveled a lot, and done so much. I genuinely love myself and I love painting and hiking and film and so much in life.. But I just am so tired. I’ve wanted to die for so long. And then two months ago, the love of my life killed himself. We were supposed to get married. He was the only person that I ever had any sort of connection with. He was so unbelievably wonderful and kind and I miss and love him so much. The past two months have been truly, truly horrible. I never thought I could feel so much pain. I’ve had a countless amount of horrible, sad nights due to my mental illness but none even compare. I bought heroin to kill myself. I’ve never done it, so I have no tolerance so mixing that and a few beers will surely do the job. It’s also how my boyfriend died (not an addict, but bought it to kill himself).

I’m driving across the country tomorrow. My family thinks I’m starting a new job (which I do have one lined up that I accepted as a “just in case”), but I’m really just going to travel for a couple more days, see some art museums, go on a hike, and then finally do it. Part of me is scared, but I can’t go on like this anymore. Each day has somehow gotten worse since my boyfriend died, and it’s absolutely unbearable.  I tried to kill myself a month ago and just ended up in a mental hospital that only made things worse. I’m sad about thinking about dying, but only because I’m sad that it can’t end up any other way. Both of my parents have life long mental illnesses that don’t go away, and I have no desire to end up like that. Anyway, I just wanted to tell someone. I’m a really open person, and it’s hard to not talk about this with anyone. Everyone around me knows I’m suicidal (obviously, since I was just in the hospital), but no one knows I have another plan.

For years I had drug abuse issues, but went on a methadone than suboxone program. I recently came off it and was struggling with withdrawals. Last night I went and bought 20 8mg dilaudid pills crushed them up put them into a needle and shot it into my arm. I had about 10 seconds where I thought should I call 911 do I really want this, and than everything faded. I woke up 10 hours later with 30 missed calls from my parents , ex girlfriend and my only friend. All who had contacted each other knowing something was wrong, as I wasn’t answering my phone and was going thru withdrawals .
I passed out in my backseat looking out at the ocean as that’s where I have grown up , and that’s what I wanted to look at last . I called my dad crying , I could hardly talk I could hardly see and I was to weak to stand up. Im not sure how I survived as my tolerance is extremely low at this point . But I did. I felt shame and embarrassment this morning , I wasn’t looking for attention . I just wanted my physical and mental pain to end.
But I’m not feeling shame tonight , I feel lucky to be alive, and thankful to those who care about me. Anyone contemplating suicide , ask someone to talk call a friend, fuck go to a hospital. I love you all , and I hope anyone going thru shit, will get thru it.

Sure, I could call a suicide hotline, but all they would do is send the police to my house, who would arrest me and take me to the hospital. So super, then I'd have the traumatizing experience of being put in handcuffs for being depressed and a hospital bill I can't afford that would eventually be sent to collections and wreck my credit. I'd still be physically alive but still no closer to fixing my mental health and all of the awful life circumstances causing my depression in the first place.

I don't know what to do. I have no one and nothing. I had some things to look forward to about a year ago, but those fell apart, and now I have truly nothing. I know I'm not being specific, but I don't have the energy to type out a really long story, and it won't matter anyway. Truthfully the only argument I have against dying is that it would kill my dog if I was suddenly gone. Earlier today, she ran away, and while I was outside looking for her, the thought that kept running through my head is, ""What if she's dead. What if a car hit her or she went swimming in the creek and an alligator ate her? Then I'd truly have no reason left to be alive."" This is what my life has come to. Nonstop thoughts like this.

I want to go to a therapist so bad, but I can't afford it. Don't tell me that there are therapists who will reduce their fees or that there are free clinics. A) It doesn't matter how much the therapist reduces their fee if I have ZERO MONEY, and B) Free clinics do not exist in my area. At all. I've researched extensively, and they just aren't a thing. I say this because every time I've posted about my situation online in the past, I've gotten flooded with people telling me to go find a free clinic or to start calling up therapists and asking if they'll reduce their fees. It's exhausting to try to explain over and over again that those solutions don't work.

973,1cep2h,False,None,48,"PSA: What's wrong with posting a general ""People care about you, please don't kill yourself"" message?",SuicideWatch,"We've been seeing an increase in this type of submission at SW lately.  You may not have noticed, because we have removed most of them, but we've missed a couple and received some understandable complaints.

First of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  But if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: 

> Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **A message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”.**  

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  Anything  meant to be universally ""uplifting"", including the overuse of the ""It Gets Better"" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

We know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  Perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  That assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (Please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)

If you only have time to write one message here, sort by ""New"" and pick an OP who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!

You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.

 I’ll never get to make stupid mistakes and grow up, bc w every little mistake my parents scream at me and emotionally abuse me, so that’s always made me terrified to do anything that they think is wrong. They don’t let me grow. They never did. But my mental illness made me grow a lot faster a lot sooner. 

I’ll live with the knowledge that I tried to kill myself on March 21, 2020 and never got to tell anyone because they wouldn’t care. My parents would just say how disappointed they were about how I didn’t tell them earlier and be all petty and shit, but my friends would probably just brush it off and say “oh wow sorry” or something. I don’t want to burden them anyway. My parents have called me a burden to them multiple times.

Is that all I’ll ever be? A burden? Someone who has to pay another person in order to share their feelings, because no one else will listen?

976,gcbei2,False,None,25,I hate humanity so much.,SuicideWatch,"It's nothing but selfishness and double standards.

You can be complaining about the cruelness and unfairness of the world with someone who agrees and even contributes to the conversation, but the moment you hint at having suicidal ideations their mind suddenly shifts and they go from talking about how the world is awful to it being this beautiful place where you can find hope in any situation. People's minds just suddenly changing like that suggests that they don't truly believe in either. Why should I have faith in your forced words?

It's perfectly okay to strip people of their homes when they're financially struggling, and it's acceptable to shove someone into a corner with little to no solutions, but committing suicide? No, you're not allowed to stop your pain. ""If you're suicidal because of a lack of money, we'll hospitalize you, do jack shit to help you, and then charge an insane amount of money for it."" And when you're released you're expected to be completely fucking cured and to go back to being a mindless, content slave. ""If you don't like being a slave, then fuck you. You can starve, because we're not going to help you. You're not useful to society so you mean absolutely nothing to us. Oh, but... don't kill yourself, because we actually care."" 

Life is shitty from the very beginning. Even as a young kid you're forced to attend school for eight hours a day and have to deal with the stress of tests and exams that determine your classes and if you're able to move forward to the next grade. Fucking 9 year old kids shouldn't have to deal with that kind of pressure. It's incredibly unfair and even as a child I knew that the education system was/is bullshit. But if you don't finish school it just makes the rest of your life even harder. You're never given a break. After or even during school, you're expected to get a job. All of the time you could have had to yourself is just gone. You never have the chance to do anything *you* want to do anymore. People stay up later and get less sleep than they should just so they can have a few hours to themselves before they have to worry about their responsibilities again. And it's a cycle that is just supposed to continue until you're too old to do anything else with your life. It's depressing shit.

Why am I mentally ill for wanting to break out of that cycle? Why are people *not* considered mentally ill for seeing this lifestyle as normal and thinking that it's possible to be happy living like that? Call me weak, lazy, etc. But I just can not mentally or physically handle the responsibilities and stress of life. It's always been too much for me. The world and everyone in it is unbelievably cruel. Situations like the one we're dealing with now just put people's natural selfishness on full display; buying everything before anyone else can, leaving their homes for unimportant reasons, etc. No one cares about anything or anyone else other than themselves. I can't seriously believe anyone who says otherwise. The proof is all around you and it's impossible to ignore.

I'm tired of all of these bullshit ""solutions"". Hospitalizing me and trapping me in a psych ward isn't going to fucking help me. It's counterproductive as shit and is just further proof that medical ""professionals"" don't know anything and lack any sort of empathy. You have to be fucked up to think that locking multiple people with different issues and illnesses together is actually effective and will help anyone. I don't care about your hotline spam and cookie-cutter ""advice"" either. No, it doesn't get better. My life has only gotten harder, and will continue to do so. You don't know me or what I'm dealing with. Stop acting like you know all the solutions to my problems, as doing so just makes you come off as incredibly ignorant. 

I don't want help by pills being shoved down my throat or by countless therapists telling me the same things but worded slightly different. I want out. Out of this life before it can get worse.

And with my luck, I know I'll be one of the ones who puts a bullet in their brain and comes out the other side with the mentality of a child. And I am not about to attempt to kill myself, survive unharmed, and deal with all that bullshit fallout.

It's just so fucking hard. All of it is. When I was in elementary school I would tell myself: ""Just make it to middle school and we'll get better.""
Middle school comes, ""Just make it to high school and we'll get better"" 
High school: ""Just make it to college and we'll be better."" College: ""Just graduate and get a job and we'll get better.""

And now I'm graduated and have a job, and I'm still not better. It doesn't get better. All of these things I've told myself over the years are lies. 

I hate myself. I hate my brain. I fucking hate living. I'm not a religious person, but I pray everyday that the cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs will start doing their jobs and finally fucking kill me. Suicide is a constant thought in my mind. It's the white noise of my brain. When I'm falling asleep, I'm thinking of taking my grandfather's gun out of the safe and finally ending it. I imagine it, everyday, all day. I can't remember the last time a day went by when I didn't.

983,bfay0g,False,None,26,"I'm not strong enough to keep doing this, I need help.",SuicideWatch,"## I know I'm far from the biggest victim of the universe, there's plenty of people that have it far worse than me. I really need to get this off my chest because it's a burden I've been holding for a while and I just no longer know what to do.

I know y'all are busy, so I've decided to put all my grievances in a list, also if you're extra busy I decided to highlight all of the key points:

1. **I feel so lonely**, I've never had a group of friends that I could constantly reach, this has been my life since I was a child. There's plenty of people that know me and people that I can interact with, I'm not an unlikable person but there's no one I have any close connection with, we're just not simply on the same channel. Despite this there're people that do talk to me and I've been ghosting most of these people because quite frankly I don't want to make their experiences worse with having them around me.
2. **I have no drive to continue doing anything**, there's literally nothing motivating to do anything. Simple things like driving a car to be wash, showering daily, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, etc. are difficult to do. My bedroom has been disorganized since december 2018, I feel really guilty about it.
3. In my search for love this past year, I was greatly disappointed with **my first boyfriend, who apparently left me for his ex.** This has made me feel terrible inside, specially because when I began dating him I told everyone about him, I even told my family. He lied about having an illness and he dumped me because he that he didn't want for me to him deteriorate, months later I texted to check up on him and he told me he was back with his ex and he also told me to stop ""obsessing over him"" and blocked my number that very same day. **I was so embarrassed I didn't told anyone what happened.**
4. I've had a **lot of meaningless sex** since he dumped me, but on the inside nothing really fills me up. **I don't even have any pleasure having sex** or have sex with guys I would particularly find attractive, however I don't know why I keep doing this.
5. **I have a severe distrust of people** because many of my close friends and the guy mentioned on point number three have made me extremely distrustful of people, it seems every person I think it's a good reliable friend ends up hurting me the most. It seems that for people I'm an acceptable target to abuse.
6. I often feel **my ""friends"" just contact me because they need something**, not because they actually want to talk to me.
7. **I constantly have suicidal thoughts**, I don't want to be here anymore and I don't understand what's the point of keeping on because I know that every time things get better from me, they don't last. Often times I could be walking near a bridge and in my head I start thinking on how can I ended it all by jumping. I've tried suicide before but no serious attempt recently.
8. **It's hard for me to focus on anything**, it's been getting worse lately, for example I can't open a tab with a YouTube video because I immediately change it.
9. For the last year I've developed a horrible **habit of compulsive spending** shit I don't need, despite all my life being someone that saves money I'm spending it all. I've even spent all my savings from 2016 - 2017 and I feel extremely guilty about it.
10. Last year I've developed a really serious habit of **binging junk food**, like literally spending serious money on junk food to eat in one sitting. For example, this week I've consumed at least 20 cans of coke.
11. I'm extremely **distrustful of people criticizing my job**, I don't like a lot what I do and every time I show someone my work for critiques, I'm mostly met with good critiques, but I feel like they're lying to me. For some reason, deep inside me, I know they're just saying that to be nice and not because they actually mean it.
12. **I have a** **severe problem with perfectionism** and it has made my life worse. Ever since I was little I do things like **compulsively ripping pages of my notebooks every time I dislike the way I'm writing.** This happens in every other aspect of my life. For example, if I don't like how I'm drawing, I rip the drawing into shreds and start again, if I don't like how my phone is organized I delete all the data and I try to reorganize it again, etc.
13. **I have no will power to do anything**, not to start projects or to finish them.
14. Lastly, **I feel ugly as fuck**, I have always felt horrible towards my personal appearance, but lately I know I look like a hot mess.

I feel in a state of emergency because this time I have really lost the will of doing anything about my situation, it's like a train is going to run over me but I can't possibly move because I don't know what to do. I've been to therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists before but I feel really weak right now and I don't know if I can hold to months of talking with a person of debilitating issues I have, so maybe they can finally tell me if I have something. I'm desperate because I need a fix for all of this things, I'm deeply concerned with not getting out of this.

What is your experience what has worked for y'all?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bfay0g/im_not_strong_enough_to_keep_doing_this_i_need/,169,I  have the exact same grievances. I'm hurting so much at the moment and I'm so sorry that you are hurting as well. ,2019-04-20 10:44:34
984,b7j2c2,False,None,32,Stop assuming we have people who care about us,SuicideWatch,"It's so annoying to here the ""think about the people who care about you"" line. A lot of us don't have those people. This isn't me being mellow dramatic or delusional, this is just my life. It also implies that youre life is only worth living because other people care about you, which is bullshit even if you do have people who care about you.

I can't make a list if all the annoying shit people say to suicidal people but this is by far the worst because they make assumptions about your life. People don't realize the privilege of having friends and a loving family so they assume we all do.

I feel like this debilitating depression is nature's way of saying 'you are not needed.' Like natural selection in real time. 

I sometimes sleep with a belt around my neck tightened just enough that I might shift into a bad position and cut off the blood flow to my brain. 

Just seems like it's meant to be for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b13hbr/i_tell_myself_that_i_am_meant_to_kill_myself_the/,171,"Humans harm themselves everyday in a million ways.
