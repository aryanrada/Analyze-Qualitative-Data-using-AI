3,dqr1vl,False,Discussion,2048,"My 86-year-old grandmother replied ""OK, boomer"" to my boomer aunt in an argument",teenagers,"Backstory: I live round the corner from my gran and visit her often so thanks to me she has a vague grasp of what memes are and how they work. The other day when I was round at hers and she asked what memes were popular at the moment so I told her about the ""OK boomer"" meme. She knew what boomers were already so she was able to get the concept of this meme fairly easily. 

Fast forward to today, I'm over at my gran's again, and she's on the phone to my aunt. They got into a disagreement over a slightly racist comment my aunt made the other day (my gran is very much against racism) and my gran eventually just said ""OK boomer"" and hung up.

I've never been so proud.

UPDATE: So I told my gran about this post and the reaction it got - she said she's glad that so many of you enjoyed her little joke and that it proves she's still young at heart.

13,a8vn3u,False,Rant,4698,Everyone said buying condoms was no big deal and nobody would say anything....,teenagers,"Well that was a fucking lie.

I pull up at Walgreens and I walk over to the aisle with condoms. I go “well shit, I guess i need some deodorant too.”  So I pick some up and then grab a box of condoms.

I get to the checkout line, i’m standing there and this one old lady is like “excuse me son, mind me asking how old you are?” And i’m like “Ummm I’m 16?” Then she purses her lips and makes this judging ass face and says, “Aren’t you a little young to be using those?”

At this point the other 5 people in the line are all looking at me so I got angry and just started acting snarky. “Oh, my bad lady, Imma just hit it raw and hope she don’t get knocked up.”  She felt offended so she shut up pretty quick. 

AND THEN when I get to the front of the line, the fucking cashier scans the box, smiles and says, “first time with these?” Are you fucking kidding me? Why would he ask that? Whatever. I just said “Um no second actually.” (Even though it was actually my first).

Ughhh. Anyways I hate people. I just want to buy some condoms in peace damn.

I basically can’t say a single bad word about China, my browsing history and everything i do/ post including this one will soon be seen by the Chinese government. What can you do? Nothing. Maybe sign some petitions or something. We lost already. Our best hope is America or the UK interfering but it’s unlikely. Reddit will be banned in Hong Kong some time soon because china is gonna reclaim us as their land or something. wanted to say, it’s been a good run and i’m gonna have to start getting used to wechat and tiktok (ew). Hopefully someone makes a _safe_ and free vpn for us. Thank you for bringing me joy for slightly more than an year. I’m probably going to be a part of a mass genocide in the next tian an men square. Stay safe and protest/ pray for us. Good bye

Edit: hey i’m still alive. So the comments have been telling me to get a vpn. The problem is, my parents are FUCKING IDIOTS AND BELIEVE IN THE GOVERNMENT. They think it’s a good thing they passed the law and there’s nothing to worry about, so they wont pay/ let me pay using their credit card for a vpn so i’m trying to find some reliable vpn

B) the reason animal crossing is banned in china is because some hong kongers made pro-hong kong banners in the game ( pretty dumb reason but yeah) so it’s not banned in hong kong

259,amhkb9,False,Serious,3854,ATTENTION ALL TEENAGERS: This sub is an early breeding ground for future INCELS and we should work to prevent it.,teenagers,"Greetings,

I've been a pretty long time reader of this sub. I have noticed a lot of posts along the lines of ""I just asked my crush out"" etc. 

Those posts are totally fine. We all like the comradery and supporting a fellow peer; however, its the comments and some of the other posts that breed this incel culture.

From the front page of this subreddit today:

 [I'm having a date with my crush in about 3 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amcok2/im_having_a_date_with_my_crush_in_about_3_hours/)

>Jesus lucky bastard

>You lucky shit! 

>Thanks, although I don't think much will change. Rn I'm just lying in bed watching anime like the lazy piece of shit I am.

>Tell us if you bang her

>I've always become friends with my crushes... just friends...

>You lucky piece of shit....

The ""lucky"" comments seem to insinuate two things. First, that love and happiness is based on luck, and that these commentors are just unlucky and won't even find love. Second, there is a bit of bitterness and disdain toward the ""lucky"" person. Kind of like saying, ""Why this fucker and not me!!!!"" Additionally, this thread also had some pretty incel-specific comments (3rd and 6th). Some of the responses to those comments were along the lines of, ""oh don't worry it gets better you just need to wait it out"". NO! That is the worst thing you can tell someone in that situation! More on that later.

[Anyone else feel heartbroken despite never having had a girlfriend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/amdkvp/anyone_else_feel_heartbroken_despite_never_having/) - **200 upvotes**

>At least you got offers

>Yep, except I didn't had any offer...

This post was pretty good overall. A lot of the other comments were supportive.

>I know how fustrating it can be trust me. But you are feeling this way because you're focusing too much on the fact that someone might turn up and then they don't. You shouldn't let wanting a relationship affect how you act or do work, otherwise you'll fall into a depression

We should take the example of this guy above. When you see someone posting stuff like this, work to counteract it. Don't let your friends on this sub fall into this incel-ish mentality. They may not be a full incel yet, but these types of feeling are what create one in the future.

**Those two posts are just examples from today. There are many more out there. PLEASE BOIS, when you see a friend display incel tenancies, try to snap them out of it!**

*If you are an incel or pre-incel reading this post, here are some suggestions to snap out of it:*

- You can't just sit idle and ""wait for life to get better""! You have to get out and do something. Make something. BE SOMETHING. Sitting idle and waiting just allows someone to perpetuate their own grievances and get mad at the world that ""life is not getting better for me"". If you want your life to get better, you have to pull yourself up by your bootsraps and tell yourself ""I want to change"".

- Work out (strength, cardio, whatever). I can't tell you how amazing you will feel once you begin getting some exercise. It is almost like a drug, it's that good. 

- Bathe. You will feel good once you're clean.

- Talk to people in person. It's not as weird as you think to just randomly just start talking to someone (men or women).

- Stop doing drugs if you do them.

- Cut out the porn. You'll begin to see women as real people instead of sex objects. 

Thanks for reading.

**THE ONE AND ONLY EDIT:**

Quoting one of the replies:

>Why does no one see the point of this post. The point of this post wasn’t to call out kids who are depressed about not being in a relationship. The whole point was to just let people know about how incel behavior, given the right conditions, can manifest itself in teens as they grow older

>If this post prevents one depressed kid from becoming an incel in any way, then it’s done it’s job.

What this person said above is true. I've had numerous people PM me and say how they are going to improve themselves and turn themselves around. WONDERFUL! I'm glad this post accomplished something. A lot of the replies to his thread are completely disgusting. Not to mention the replies that perfectly exhibit the behavior I am trying to point out in this post.

Thanks to those that were able to have a civilized discussion.

322,axf7kt,False,Discussion,2494,To the teenager who came into my shop today with your mom,teenagers,"Your mom came in today asking for my help to invade your private life. She even brought you with her. I can’t imagine how embarrassing that must be. 

She asked me to go through your phone and computer and find any apps or photos that she wouldn’t approve of, because she was too technology illiterate to do it herself, all the while making you watch. (I work at a tech support shop) 

Personally I think this is an invasion of your personal space and privacy. 

So when I found the folder where you’d hid all your movies and games, I made sure to pretend I didn’t see them. 

On your phone, I told her that you didn’t have anything but the default apps and angry birds. 

And then, I showed her a place where she could look on your phone that would only show her the default apps, not the ones you downloaded. So hopefully when she invaded your space again, she won’t find anything. 

Was I wrong to do what I did? Probably. But you’re only a year or two away from adulthood and I don’t think it’s right that anyone be that intrusive, mother or not. 

Good luck in life man. Hope things get better for you soon. 


Edit: Thanks for the shiny medals! I’ll be sure to take good care of them. 

Also, way too many comments to keep up with, but I’ll try to read them all and respond :)

They tried hugging, kissing and groping me pretty much every day no matter how many times I've told them to stop or that I don't appreciate it. I've been firm with them and warned them that I'll report it but they aren't phased. It dropped off after July this year when I lost it with them after a week of getting my ass grabbed at every opportunity and told them to get out of my life forever.
They've recently started again and they're just toying with me like I'm an object to vent their abuse on. I never did anything about it because I thought nobody would take me seriously as I have a lack of evidence due to cameras not being around school.
I break up for half term next Friday and I'm going to hand in a report of all of the incidents that have occurred with them including dates, times and witnesses. They've broken me and I'm not going to let the school sweep this under the rug. If they don't act on it I'm planning on giving the report to every school teacher I have and to the local newspaper, as I'm sure it'll make local news. 

Teenagers of reddit, how do I get the school to take me seriously and do something about this?

Now I can do all three and I just wanted to share. I’ve been working on this for years - the therapy and practice and surgeries have finally started to pay off! For anyone asking for proof- here! 
Thank you all so much for your support! As someone that genuinely suffers from anxiety seeing you all comment really helps!

Cliches are often cliches because they're true- take this one day at a time. You won't ever forget them and frankly, it will ALWAYS hurt. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I hurt because I love my brother and to cease the hurt is to stop loving him. Grief is an expression of love.

Your grief will come in waves- sometimes its overwhelming and sometimes it doesn't feel real. You will get better at dealing with the waves and they'll come less frequently. Don't bottle this up but don't dwell to long either. You CAN do this.

477,fu97bt,False,Rant,5105,I just woke up to my mom sitting in the chair next to my bed LOOKING through my phone,teenagers,"I asked her why she was doing this

""I'm your mother""

I said, ""If I was doing this i would get grounded.""

""Yep.""

""Do I not have privacy?""

What she said next phisically pains me

&#x200B;

""Well, I'm sitting here next to you waiting for you to wake up with nothing to do, so I was bored.""

""Why were you waiting?""

""you have schoolwork and I want you to get started on it""

""Then tell me to get started on it and don't look through my stuff!""

&#x200B;

I don't know how long she was there, or what she looked through, but damn, really?

&#x200B;

Edit: Yes I have a password. I'm not *THAT* stupid. Somehow she figured it out and here we are.

Edit 2: To all the people saying ""Well, you don't pay for it, so screw you.""

That's akin to saying, ""Do you pay for the house? No. So take the door off the bathroom.""

Edit 3: There's a bunch of people saying that I should be happy I have a phone. I am. 100%. The problem I have is that we're all entitled to privacy (even my fucking mother) no matter if it's online, offline, inline, outline. Privacy is a right, not a privilege. Nobody likes a constant helicopter.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: Jesus, a lot of people are like, ""Well you're the idiot for not having a secure password, you deserved it. I didn't set the password. My dad did. I haven't had a problem until now. I should have reset it but didn't because of lack of issue.

&#x200B;

Edit 5: Let me clear a lot of the main arguments up.

If you are worried about your child's safety then absolutely you can go through it. If there's no cause for alarm, and you happen to be, oh, I don't know, bored waiting for your kid to wake up, then that's just an invasion.

&#x200B;

Sure, I may sound like an entitled brat, but if there's a line that one cannot cross, why should the other be able to cross it ?

&#x200B;

Yeah, I live under Mom's roof. That doesn't mean that if i'm asleep and she's bored she can look through my stuff.

&#x200B;

The phone WAS a gift, meaning she wanted me to have it to do as I please. Again, if there's reason, go ahead, ask to look. She gave me it accepting that risk of me having free will with it. It's a stupid argument when you say that she payed for it, so I can't have a normal human right. If you give a kid a hot wheels car, then forbid him from using it because he didn't pay one dollar to have it, that's pretty shitty.

&#x200B;

I REALLY want my own phone plan and yet I don't get an allowance and can't travel anywhere as it is. I guess I could skateboard or bike to wal-mart, but she'd get suspicious and shut it down.

&#x200B;

If you ask to go through it, go right ahead. If there's a suspicion, go right ahead. Don't do it during a kid's sleep.

&#x200B;

There's a lot of boomers, and they have like 3 arguments. Hope i cleared that up so that my inbox isn't as full as it is.

As some of you might be aware, a spinoff series of SpongeBob SquarePants known as “Kamp Koral” is supposedly coming to fruition soon. Whatever you do, **DO NOT SUPPORT IT.** Don’t watch it, don’t promote it, don’t recommend it to anyone. This is spitting in the face of late Stephen Hillenburg (the creator of SBSQ), whom Nickelodeon *waited for to die* in order to go against his wishes. 

I’m only drawing attention to this to warn you all. This is disguised as something innocent, but it’s so indescribably fucked up. 
Don’t support Nickelodeon in general, if you can help it.

Yelling slurs, vandalism, ice thrown on us, threats and even kicking our dog. While my school waa still open, some grade 9-10s cornered me and my friend, and gut punched us, kicked us, spit on us, slapped us, then ran. I was pretty hurt, but my friend was stronger than me, and sucked it up pretty quickly. All the school did was ask if I knew who did it, and then just made an announcement, saying racism is bad, and that's that. 

I've also had death threats made at me, water thrown on me, and been spat on. A LOT. Luckily, I always washed it of thoroughly with hot water and soap.

This god-awful racism isn't the answer to the virus cure. Beating up Asians won't do anything! Please, spread the word, MOST Asians only want peace, not violence, excluding the Chinese and North Korean government.

Thank you, for taking the time to read MY story.

627,exk4v7,False,Advice,1414,"Well r/teenagers, it’s been a fun ride. After today I will officially be 20 years old. To celebrate the milestone, here’s 20 bits of advice I wish I had when I had just become a teenager (turning 13)",teenagers,"1. Being a teenager is hard as fuck; you find yourself in a state of flux where almost nobody will relate at all to you, whether they’re young or old. *This is okay.*

2. It’s gonna take a while for you to find who you really are. You probably won’t start settling on a solid persona until you hit 16-18.

3. What seems permanent right now is most likely just a phase, even though you said how much it really is you forever now.

4. That doesn’t mean resist what you want to do because it’s just a phase. Embrace the weird stuff. Listen to death metal. Watch anime. Paint your nails. Wear crazy neon colors that don’t match. Do it. And take lots of pictures when you do. It’ll be hilarious later.

5. Talk to your crush. Ask her out. It’s okay to be nervous, just don’t be weird.

6. It helps if you get to know her as a person a little bit before making your move, and at least make it *seem* like you have a sense of self-respect. Clean up after yourself, look/smell clean, and for fuck’s sake, don’t seem like you’re desperate.

7. **Make some goddamn friends.** It absolutely sucks to look back on most of your high school experience and realize that all you did was play video games, watch anime, and jerk off the entire time. All that will do is make you feel depressed and worthless. (You’re still gonna feel that way regardless, but at least you’ll have someone to talk about it with)

8. Find some people that you can relate to. If you’re a nerd who likes to talk about anime, science, and video games, try talking to the quiet kid or something.

9. Sit in the *back of every fucking class*. If you’re lucky you can snack, use your phone, and draw dicks on the table all year without the teacher noticing.

10. In a few years. you’re either gonna find a lot of formerly cool shit right to be cringy as fuck, or you’re going to *be* cringy as fuck. Try to be the first one.

11. Learn to laugh at your cringeworthy moments, and learn from your true mistakes.

12. Talk to the janitor. Learn his/her name. Use it.

13. Talk to the security guards. Find out which ones are the cool ones. Trust me, I’ve gotten out of *so much shit* just because I had a security guard cover my ass.

14. Join clubs. If you don’t like them, don’t go, but at least try a few and see if you can get involved. Same goes with after-school activities.

15. If you’re gonna fuck, **get some fucking protection.**

16. If you’re gonna smoke weed, **get some fucking snacks, and do it with people that you like.**

17. If you’re not primarily focused on academics, getting a part-time job to earn some cash is literally one of the best things you can do while still in school.

18. That doesn’t mean “get all ‘C’s and work at McDonalds”. Your academics are important and your performance in school should be a priority.

19. Getting a license and a car is **SO FUCKING WORTH IT.** Your world opens up like ten times over when you suddenly have the capability to drive anywhere you want to go. If you’re the guy/girl with a ride, it’s super easy to cement yourself as the “pack leader” for your friend group. Plus it’s going to set you up for success after you graduate.

20. More than anything, live life how you really want, on your terms. Don’t bottle yourself up and hide who you really are. You’re a special, one-of-a-kind human being and there won’t ever be another person like you ever again. You are made up of the essence of a thousand dying stars, and you have that same power to light up the world with what potential you have. Use it wisely.

And with that, r/teenagers, I bid you farewell. I hope you all have an excellent 6 years of confusion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/exk4v7/well_rteenagers_its_been_a_fun_ride_after_today_i/,41228,Well number was is wrong so I can assume the rest are too.

J/K I’m a dad of a teen and feel like I need to get something off my chest.,teenagers,"First, and I want to make this abundantly clear, it is never ok to hit a kid or get in their face and scream (emotional abuse). So if your parents do this, they are wrong and I’m not defending them.

Second, I browse this subreddit because it helps me understand things from the teenage point of view, my son doesn’t really talk to me about serious matters, it seems he has a hard time opening up about serious stuff.

Third, I see a lot of posts and comments about parents “flipping out over small stuff.” The small stuff can add up to be “big stuff” if you let it. It can get supremely annoying having to clean up the same breakfast mess every day, when I’ve explicitly told him to do it and I need to leave for work. Or when I’m doing laundry and can’t find any towels, then I go into his bedroom and there are SIX towels on the bedroom floor. Those are just a couple examples, but basically by not taking care of the “small things,” you are communicating to your parents that their time isn’t valuable, or that *they* are not valuable. 

Don’t crucify me, just trying to help you guys see a different viewpoint.

As minors, we are legally entitled to almost zero privacy from our parents. This year, I've spent countless time trying to keep my activities private and secure from the internet at large, adding two factor to all of my accounts, never attaching social media to my name, only for my parents to ask for all of my passwords.

Oh, and I have to turn off all my two factor authentication, too.

So why did I bother in the first place?

Because I wanted something that I alone owned. It has always felt like my parents own my entire life, except for my internet use. The internet, for me, felt like the one place where I could be my own person and have my own space. Nope. Not anymore. My parents need all of my passwords.

The reason I'm deleting this account is that my parents are scared social media is full of rapists and hackers, and Reddit is DaNgErOuS, not a place to find a like minded community that shares your thoughts, feelings, and frustrations.

Yes. Due to a certain asshole, I know some people won’t believe me, so I will attach photos of me. They  are taken off my parents Facebook. Also, due to phobias of being doxxed, if you want to see them please send me a message over DMs. I will send a dm with a link to see them. They will be slightly edited so  they cannot be traced back to me, but due to the amount of photos (and a modern day photo for you to compare too) I am hoping that it will be enough to prove that it is real. The imugur links no longer work. It is 11:30pm where I am, and I may stop responding soon, as it’s late. If I do go offline, I will be back to send DMs tomorrow sometime.

Goodnight. Love you all

March 28th 2017, a Tuesday. Diagnosed around 9:45pm

I was rushed to the hospital that day. I had blood taken, but my leukaemia was so bad, that the leukaemia made my spleen and liver swell, and push  up against my liver. I couldn’t eat. They could tell I had some sort of cancer after a 10 minute checkup.
[here is a photo of me that night, aged 12](https://imgur.com/gallery/LdPdoqV)

I begin treatment. I’m moved to a specialised hospital. I began 2 years and 4 months of chemotherapy. 

It was hard and sucked ass.

But on the 3rd of July, I took my last meds.

On the 4th july, I was officially signed off and rang my bell. I’m so excited and had to share it. I know you are all strangers but I kinda just want to tell the world. I wanna shout it out. I’m alive! I am proud. And I am happy. 

So whilst everyone eats hotdogs and watches the fireworks, I’ll be celebrating from the uk. Thanks dudes. :)

[fat me ringing the bell this time last year](https://imgur.com/gallery/S3oxcA1)

I will now input several pictures of me, just for proof. Gonna do this as that loser faked having cancer.

Also, if anyone is still looking a this post (thanks) but I would like to mention a couple of charities which helped me, and won’t give away my location and address

Make a wish and CLIC saergent. If you can, please use the DreamLab app (it’s free). Or donate to a cause that means a lot to you. Donate to something you are passionate about, if you can afford to and want to. I don’t want awards.

Even though I know That I’m real and I’m not faking and I’m just sharing something I’m proud of to the whole world, you can’t guarantee I’m real. That’s one thing that [redacted] taught us.

Enjoy your evenings. Love you all. :)

Moving forward to 7th grade, I was moving out of America and the kid was in the same class as me still. He was absent because of a really major seizure. On my final day of school, his mom came in and called my name. The kid literally gifted me a 20 dollar silver mechanical pencil just because I lended him a wooden pencil.

A, Angelman syndrome aka happy puppet syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes developmental and neurological disabilities. They usually have epilepsy, and get attracted to water easily. But I hope that who ever suffers from this can rebound and shine like an angel.

756,b7ko4b,False,Social,2209,Do NOT stick your dick inside a shampoo bottle,teenagers,"TIFU fellow teens. Very badly.

&#x200B;

TLDR at bottom.

&#x200B;

To preface, I used to masturbate a lot, and still sometimes do. Usually, I do it in the shower. For around an hour (whenever I get the chance).

&#x200B;

So today I had the great idea based on the notion of ""since shampoo feels soft in my hands/hair, maybe it would feel good on my dick?"" So I took a whole bunch in my hand, and rubbed it all over. It felt good at first too, basically what you would imagine it to feel like.

&#x200B;

Then I got the great idea of sticking it in the shampoo bottle.

&#x200B;

With some effort (not to flex but my dick is pretty wide) I managed to get it in there completely. This was not a good idea. First of all, I couldn't even move it around cuz it was super tight. Like there was so much friction, it was stuck. And I couldn't move it out either. I started to panic. I looked like a complete idiot, my entire penis encased by this huge bottle. I tried jumping up and down, pulling it off with my hands, then my feet, it was such an ordeal.

&#x200B;

The entire time, my dick was floating around in shampoo-y substances, which wasn't a problem at first. Until it started FUCKING BURNING.

&#x200B;

HOLY HELL I cannot accurately describe the pain of having a burning schlong. It was this icy-fire feeling, that kept throbbing continuously. I could barely stop myself from screaming.  Tears and all, I was a mess.

&#x200B;

At this point I would do anything to get it off. So I figured out a plan, dried myself, put on my biggest pair of pants (some flannel) to hide the giant-ass shampoo bottle and a t-shirt so I could get some butter from the fridge. So as I'm making my way to the fridge, MY MOM tells me to come up to her room to ""talk about my academic failure,""

&#x200B;

I sat through 20 minutes of her talking shit about me with a freezing-burning penis. After that shit-show, I tried running back to my room. I was sweating, crying, and couldn't hold my own weight. I fell down on my knees and crawled the rest of the way to my room with my melted butter stick.

&#x200B;

To shorten a long process, I rubbed some butter over the lid, and after a while, the bottle popped off to reveal my burning-red manhood.

&#x200B;

As i'm writing this, my dick still hasn't fully healed, and I think I ripped the skin, which means no more masturbating for a while

&#x200B;

Lesson: Never, EVER, stick your dick in a shampoo bottle.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Got horny, thought it would be a good idea to put my dick into a shampoo bottle. Turned out not to be a good idea. Got stuck for 40 minutes. burning. ow. butter stick came off. shriveled, reddened cock.

&#x200B;

Update: Upon further examination, the skin is a couple shades redder than it usually is, I can see red enflamed muscle-y things where the skin peeled off, and the entire thing looks like armadillo skin. My dick was also bleeding from multiple exit points. FUCK WHY AM I SO STUPID

&#x200B;

Update 2: Its getting better, if I do nothing with it, it feels fine, shades of red are nearing normal skin color I think. Its mainly flaky skin which is bothering me but the red muscley parts are still there, not bleeding anymore. Thanks for the concern, but I think i'll be fine. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/b7ko4b/do_not_stick_your_dick_inside_a_shampoo_bottle/,37571,This reminds me of the time I used soap as lube. My horny little ass used to just jerk it dry b/c I had no lube. One day I decided to use soap cuz it certainly felt like lube. It didn’t for long. My urethra started to b u r n once it came into contact with my pp hole. I had to pee it all out and it burned whilst doing that too. Im pretty sure I permanently fucked up my nerves down there. ,2019-03-31 06:14:34

It all started in first grade gym class. We had a little course set up and you could go fuck around freely   at the end of the lesson. 

They had some ropes hanging from the ceiling that you could climb or swing on. I was climbing and slipped a little so I grabbed the rope tightly and straightened my legs to press the rope between my thighs. At that point what happened was very confusing to a 7 year old retard. I pissed my pants (witch later turned out to be cum) and slid down the rope mid-orgasm. I told my friend to climb the magic nut-rope, but he didn't believe. 

I still to this day wonder how my underdeveloped limp penis managed to crank one out.

All of his money went into his car. He had just recently bought some new stuff for his 2014 Camaro and was waiting to put it on. That car was going to look so good when he was done with it. I had recently gotten him into motorcycles too. He’s the reason I love cars so much, and he’s the reason I go to the gym. We even played Xbox all the time and he spent so much time playing forza. He would sit there for hours building a car and making a perfect tune for it.  I’m mainly writing this to get it off my chest, but I love and miss you already bro. I don’t know what I’ll do without you. R.I.P 🙏

829,eq7ywj,False,Serious,1321,Responding to hate on the internet (my story),teenagers,"Last year, I was scrolling through my Instagram feed, looking at my usual shitty memes, when I saw a comment that simply said ""Fuck the Jews, they control us all"". I didn't think much of it, since I'm used to seeing edgy 4chan shit online, but I decided to look to take a look at the account that posted it.

When I opened the account, all I saw were two kinds of posts; posts about depression and suicide, and wildly antisemitic posts. I'm a Jew, so I felt a combined sense of confusion (almost to a humorous point) and anger at what I saw. I was planning on commenting angrily on all of his antisemitic posts, but then I had an idea.

I remembered seeing a news story (still haven't found out if it's real or fake) about a black man who convinced hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan by befriending them, and I wanted to see if I could replicate this. So, I kept the account in the back of my mind, periodically looking at his posts. One day, he put up a story asking if anyone wanted to be added to a groupchat to play Rainbow Six: Siege on PC. I decided to respond positively, so I could further my plan (and also because I really wanted to play R6 with someone).

Now, from my posts, it was pretty evident that I'm Jewish, so the first thing he replied was ""ok Jew"". I knew he wouldn't add me to a groupchat just for that reason, but surprisingly, he did. We all started playing R6 together, and this guy seemed to treat me normally, but he never called me by my name. It was always ""Good kill, Jew"" or ""Get on Discord, Jew"".

However, soon we grew closer, to the point where he shouted me out on his account, calling me ""the one good Jew to be born"". But I could tell that was always his sole impression of me. He only really identified me by my religion. I could also tell from his posts about depression that he likely suffered from it.

Then one day, at around 11:30 PM, as I was about to get off Instagram and go to sleep, I saw a new post from him. The photo was just some weird dark lo-fi art, and all the caption said was ""Killing myself, see you guys"".

Immediately, I got scared and instinctively began typing a message to him in his DMs. I thought it may all be in vain, and that he had maybe already done it. But I just couldn't stop typing. I couldn't bear to see another person die a needless death to depression, even if they didn't like my people. I don't wanna talk in specifics about what I said (it's very tough for me to write this now), but I concluded by telling him that, if his life didn't matter and nobody cared about him, why would a Jew, 300 miles away and 3 years younger (he's 19 I'm 16) even be trying to save his life.

After a rough night of sleep, I woke up and fearfully checked my DMs. All I saw from him was a photo and a message. The photo was just him smiling and doing a thumbs-up. In the message, he once again did not call me by my name. However, he didn't call me ""Jew"" either. All his message said was ""Thanks friend"".

He's now doing way better. He's since deleted all of his antisemitic posts, and we now like to discuss history and politics together (and of course play R6). He met his girlfriend soon after, who he is still with. And two days ago, he finally got his dream job: a designer for a small tabletop RPG company.

When confronted with hate on the internet, too many people let their emotions take control, and start flaming each other. Next time you see someone spreading prejudice online, even against a group that you are part of, do not fall into this habit. Instead, I challenge you to talk to them, and try to understand what they may be going through. You might change their mind, you might make a friend, and you might even save a life.

wish me a good recovery guys.

843,e44sr3,False,Serious,1007,I will be turning 20 in an hour. Farewell r/teenagers,teenagers,"(Reposting cuz I'm stupid and forgot to flair)

Well I'm about to turn 20 years old so I thought it'd only be fitting to say goodbye. Even though I never posted here it's always been fun lurking here. In the last 7 years that I was a teenager, I've failed my high school, got kicked out of community college, been arrested, attempted suicide, and dealt with drug addiction. But I have turned most things around, and I'm in a happier place now. So here's some advice that I wish a had when I was younger (Take it with a grain of salt, since I'm young and was a troubled teenager.):

* **Take responsibility for your actions.** If something happens, fess up and deal with the consequences.

* **Stop obsessing what you look like.** Most people don't care what you look like, so stop obsessing over it, but do take care of your hygiene.

* **Don't compare someone's life with yours.**

* **Use a fucking condom, even if she tells you that she's on the pill.**

* **Put effort in the things you want to achieve.**

* **Do not start smoking.** Shits expensive af.

* **Do not say 'Sure, why not' when someone's offering you heroin at a camping site at a festival.**

* **Just do not do hard drugs in general.** Don't.

* **Know what resources are available to you.** Google it or ask your country's subreddit.

* **You will grow apart from a lot of your friends.** This is ok, just appreciate the friendships while they last.

* **Reach out to your friend with mental illness.** Just the invite itself can make somebody's week.

* **But don't be afraid to put yourself first, you can’t help others if you’re not ok.**

* **You are not defined by your disorder. You are not your disorder.** I believe you are a human.

* **Don’t be afraid to have a conversation or to seek professional help.** Be honest and kinder to yourself and those around you, your body and mind will be grateful for it.

I had a female student (I'm a male), who was rather attractive. Not gonna lie. But I would never pursue a student  romantically. Apparently, that feeling was not mutual. At first, things were like they usually were with stupid young girl crushing: double entendres, very subtle comments, etc. But there's a line, and she crossed it.

She wrote her number on an essay with a smiley face. This was not okay by any means. I immediately contacted an administrator so I wouldn't get in any trouble. These sorts of things are taken very seriously at pretty much any grade level these days, and I'm not interested in losing my job over some girl's hormones getting the best of her.

So a couple of days later, this administrator called a meeting with the parents. We were all in the office and the administrator was doing his spiel to the girl and her parents about appropriate behavior at school and appropriate age differences and the like (apparently this is a common enough issue that he had some training on how to have this kind of talk). She looked fairly ashamed, staring at the floor the whole time. He finished his rehearsed rant and then asked the parents if they had anything they wanted to say to the daughter. 

The father was silent, but the mother spoke up. She said something about how the girl should know better and how they taught her better than this, etc. The usual parent reprimand stuff. But teenage girls can often find ways to surprise you. The mom asked her daughter, ""And what did you even expect would come of something like this?"" My student was quiet for a moment, looking down at the floor still, but then she turned to me, and I will never forget the way she looked at me when she said it: ""About tree fiddy."" It was about this time I noticed that my student was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the paleozoic era. I said, ""Damn it, monsta, get out of this office! I ain't givin' you no damn tree fiddy!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/bd2hda/im_a_teacher_that_lurks_here/,35126,10/10 so thankful for this post ,2019-04-14 12:57:24

895,g8ku2x,False,Other,1548,I fucked up by using acne medicine instead of lotion while masturbating,teenagers,"Fuck me.

This fuck up occurred one month ago, and I will remember it for the rest of my life.

On one particular night, I was feeling VERY horny. My PP was definitely not coming down any time soon, so I decided I should jack off and call it a night. I draw my pink headed warrior, my spear of impregnation, my magic wand. I’ve always been particularly fond of my genitalia.

My friend had told me once that using lotion can make masturbating feel 10x better, so I said ”*hey, why not*?” and go to my bathroom. I scan the room for lotion, and my eyes fall upon a white bottle with a pump on the top. There it is! I pick it up and bring it back to my room.

I laid down in bed and pumped a small amount of the substance into my dominant hand and spread it around on my weewee, much like spreading cream cheese on a nice piece of toast. **Damn, that felt so good**. My hand could stroke so much faster. I pumped myself a handful of the sweet lotion and applied it to the pp.

I stroked harder and harder and harder. I kept thinking about my GF’s pair while doing so. These to aspects in combination led to the sweetest orgasm I’d had in a while.

There was no need to wash the lotion-like substance off, because it had been completely rubbed into my PP. God, what a mistake. Feeling satisfied, I lay down on my pillow thinking about seeing my beautiful girl again, and go to sleep.

I woke the next day at exactly 9:24 AM.

I remember my eyes shooting open.

**My dick was on fire**.

I shit you not, it felt as though a small supernova had been unleashed upon my meat scepter. I screamed and fell out of my bed. I pull my pants and and underwear out of the way to see what was stimulating such agony in my penis.

I will not describe what I saw.

All I will say is that it was something you’d see in a horror movie. Plain and simple. Pure hell released upon my once glorious dong.

I muster whatever remaining strength there was in my legs, and sprinted to the bathroom.

I turn on the faucet and set it to the coolest setting. When I put my dick under the cool jets of water, I let out a whimper. God, I wanted to take a greatsword and just cut it off. I bite my lip while tears roll down my cheek.

I look at the lotion bottle I had used last night. I check the label to see if it had Shea butter, something I’m allergic to. One word caught my eye: acne. I gasp in horror. I turn the bottle, to be met with the words **acne medication**.

A medication which is designed to dry up skin and to be used in small amounts.

**And I had rubbed an entire handful of it into my penis.**

I let out a scream, this one louder than the first. My dick was in absolutely agonizing pain. But then, in my self induced shock, I have a faint memory. I had recently been struggling with dry skin on my face, and had been handling it by using a special cream.

”*It just might work*” I mutter to myself. I grab the cream and begin rubbing it over my now numb penis. Instant pain, but also a feeling of relief. Tears of pain and frustration are falling, but I don’t stop. I continue this process for the next hour locked in the bathroom. Every hour or so, I rubbed a bit more into my penis. My mom would occasionally ask *”is everything ok honey?”* to which I would halfheartedly tell her that I love her.

Over the next two days, my dick had completely healed. It was a painful recovery, but I had done it.

**TL;DR**: I was feeling horny, so I decided to use what looked like lotion to help masturbate. Little did I know, it was actually acne medicine. This proceeded to fuck up my penis.

Fuck me, hopefully you got a laugh out of my stupidity.

Some points may not apply to you, and others may be cultural. It extremely important to main the niceness of your cock and to take everything with a grain of salt. 


The amount of “I’m lonely, I need to be in a relationship” posts are insane so I decided to put together a small little list. 

1. Basic hygiene. I think that most guys under estimate how much of an impact just not smelling like a sweat ball can make. The opposite is also true. Please do not smell like the inside of a can of axe. 

2. Ability to take care of yourself.  By this I mean you don’t have to have a six pack by any means, just show that you care about yourself. It can even be as simple as just having some sort of outlet wether that be athletic or artistic, or even just dressing semi nicely (doesn’t mean expensively), it doesn’t really matter. It’s pretty obvious, if you can’t take care of yourself, there’s no way you’re ready for a relationship. 

3. Being authentic with a personality. It’s so easy to see when someone’s genuinely happy vs when they’re just trying to fit in. Be yourself, and be confident. If nothing else, be confident that you are yourself.  If you aren’t confident, just fake it till you make it. Ask yourself, “if the most confident person in the world was here, in my shoes, what would they do?”, then just do that regardless of how hard it may be. Also having a personality goes along ways. Don’t be different just for the sake of being different, but at the same time, be unique, be you. 

4. Treating us like normal human beings.  We are not sex objects, and thus should not be treated as such (I’m a bad example of this lol). This isn’t some third wave feminism bullshit, it’s just about basic levels of respect. Being female doesn’t make us superior or inferior, we are just as anxious, awkward and uncomfortable as you guys (I think so anyways). Being able just talk to us normally goes a long ways. 

5. Not pushing things TOO far. For better or worse girls will almost never make the first move, it’s almost a pride thing if I’m being honest, but we will drop hints ([this comment contains further information regarding the different ways that “hints” are generally displayed](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hojv83/things_girls_actually_care_about/fxicxss/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)). Generally if we haven’t made it abundantly clear you’re friend zoned, you haven’t been. In that regard don’t befriend a girl in hopes of perusing a relationship. It’s like asking to be friend zoned then getting annoyed that you get friend zoned, no one wins ([check out this comment which inspired this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hojv83/things_girls_actually_care_about/fxip0wp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) ).  Also please respect their decision. If you ask and we say no, it’s not changing, but honestly 9/10 times it’s a yes.  



No goes:

- smelly (ew)

- Self loathing (be confident)

- Don’t try to be someone you aren’t

- Self entitlement 

- Egotistical. There’s sort of a grey area on this one and comes down to personal preference, but in general being self confident is a great thing, but being overly so can be an instant no go. 


Bonus points:

- If you are good with either children kids or pets (will melt our hearts)

- Having a sense of humour goes a long way in having a good personality. 

- Being self aware of your flaws, but not overly self conscious 

- When complimenting be specific. Say something about her that is only relevant to her. It just shows that you actually care about her. 

- Ability to communicate in general and be open emotionally (emotional maturity). The strong silent type might work for some, but 9 times out of 10 it comes across as being completely emotionally immature (which by the way is also a no go)

- Not complaining when we inevitably start taking your clothes



That all being said, I’d be lying if I said looks had nothing to do with it. We all LIKE the body, generally it’s the person we fall in LOVE with. For all you gamer guys it’s like an RTX 2060 with built in RGB vs an RTX 2080ti without RGB. It’s what’s underneath that we actually appreciate.  



I love you, have a fantastic day.  
Also sorry for shitty formatting, on mobile :)

941,edosh7,False,Rant,497,"These fake ""I beat cancer"" posts are pissing me off because I haven't beat my real cancer",teenagers,"There aren't a lot of then that I've seen but they just make me mad. I got diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September and it's been a real shitty time. I can't go to school but still have to do most of the work at home. I rarely get to see my friends. I get so nauseous from my medicine every other week that I literally cant get out of bed for days straight without puking. And technically I don't even have it that bad when it comes to types of cancer so I can't imagine what it's like for people with harsher types than mine.

Maybe I just need to learn to take a joke or something but it really annoys me.

Edit: realized I should be more clear. I'm not mad about people seriously claiming they have cancer because I don't know if they do or not, but the ones that lead with ""I beat cancer"" and then you click to see that they're saying that because they deleted instagram or something make me mad
