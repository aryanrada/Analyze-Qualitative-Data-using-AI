4,gjs92i,False,None,0,Y&G is your first step in changing the world,YouthandGovernment,"Hey Y&G fam. I'm new to Reddit but I was a 5-year delegate in Y&G. I was homeschooled in until high school and my lead advisor snuck me into MLC when I was in 8th grade. So I got to 're-do' my senior year in MLC twice ;) (don't tell anyone). In my half-decade at California Y&G, I ran for office 3 times, was in Assembly for 5 YEARS, and was the 69th Speaker Pro-Tem. of the blue Assembly. I had a life-changing experience. I really mean life-changing. Y&G helped me to get a summer internship with my local assemblymember (I met him in the capitol building). All of my experience with politics led me to run for San Jose, CA City Council at 18 years old. I just finished the campaign in March 2020. I didn't win, but just by being a young adult on a stage and ballot with people 3 times my age was a win. Plus, I got 1,900 votes and forced the business-backed incumbent into a runoff with a progressive green party candidate (Search Jake4D6 on IG). 

If you have any questions about Y&G, youth engagement with politics, or anything else, I would love to chat here or connect on social media @ MarshallWoodmanseeOfficial. 

This world needs you to raise your hand. This world needs you to make that nervous, back of the bill-book speech. This world needs you to fight for your fellow delegate. 

This world needs you.

I am currently conducting a research paper about the lack of youth vote in this country. I aim to analyze the literate activity of voting as a youth citizen, discover what motivates us to vote, and what steps can be made to increase our turnout. So with that being said I have gone to reddit to conduct primary research on my peers and see exactly how they feel about the subject. Below I have presented some questions for you guys to answer, along with some basic information about yourself, in order to help me get a better idea as to how our generation (ages 18-29) feels about the subject. Your time is valued and appreciated. 

Basic info (all optional):

age-

Race-

1. Do you plan on voting this presidential election? (why or why not)

2. Do you plan on voting this mid-term election? (why or why not) 

3. do you think voting is important? (why or why not)

4. why do you think we as youth do not vote?

5. do you feel as though the government puts enough emphasis on getting youth to vote?

6. Do you believe the government wants to do anything about this ""problem""

Reddit’s Model House of Commons (a parliament simulation) has just begun voting in it’s 5th General Election and it’s open to anyone interested in voting (which is easy, fairly anonymous, and fast).

I’m asking for your vote for the Green Party because we have stood tirelessly for fair and equal elections, social justice, LGBT rights, environmentalism, economic policies focused on helping the average individual, and an intelligent foreign policy. The Green Party has elected 2 past Prime Ministers and has a strong and active showing on the Model House of Commons.

I hope you take a brief moment of your time to help our subreddit continue to function, since we run off of the votes of the public. While it is just a simulation, this of course is very real and very enjoyable for all of us, and your time is a huge help. Every vote matters!

Please come and vote GREEN here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/46xtgq/general_election_v_megathread/

Here’s also a full link to our manifesto if you’re interested: https://issuu.com/df44/docs/mhoc_greens_gev_manifesto_final
