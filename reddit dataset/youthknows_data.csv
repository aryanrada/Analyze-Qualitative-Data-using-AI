Thats not to say you should get drunk and do stupid shit every weekend or put off starting a solid career, just don't get all bogged down in spending your life with someone early on and disregarding the opportunities you have. 

Go play a sport, take up some fun hobbies that don't involve sitting around inside, get some friends that are genuinely fun and spend some time being social.

Strangers are people too... don't be afraid to talk to them, they may just show you the time of your life.

5,dthgi,False,None,5,Private colleges are almost never worth paying for and get as much college credit in high school as you can,youthshouldknow,"Exceptions: ""Big-name"" schools (Ivy League, various Tech schools), or if you get a **good** scholarship (that you **keep!**) 

Seriously,  everywhere else you get the same piece of paper as a person who goes to the state college at 10x the cost.

My second point- take as many AP classes as you can physically and mentally handle. Each one you get credit for is another $1000-2500+ dollars saved. Or, my school had a program where you could get college and high school credit for classes at the local community college. I wish I had taken more advantage of that. The classes aren't much harder than most high school classes, though the teachers will be much less forgiving.

Speaking of community college, go for a year or two before transferring to a ""real"" college. Figure out what subjects you actually like and are good at, and get your core classes out of the way. Then transfer to a real college, and stay in the dorms so you can meet people. 

I'm telling you this now, because my wife and I didn't do this. Now, about 1/4 of our (very good) salaries go to student loans, preventing us from doing a lot of things. Don't get stuck like us.

Some suggestions, all based on first or second hand experience:  

 * Life guard - you may or may not have to pay for your licence, but it's usually at least $2/hour more than minimum wage. You make up the difference in like 2 weeks. You are sitting on your butt, listening to music the whole time or swimming with a bunch of kids. Tell me that doesn't sound better than serving people fries.  
 * Bus boy/waiter- at a **real restaurant**. Hard work, always busy, but you can get tons of money on the weekend, especially if you can work your way into a nice restaurant. Plus, free food a lot of the time (esp important when you get to college)  
 * Camp Councilor- room and board free, decent pay, a summer away from your parents. You don't have a lot to spend your money on, so you can save it up and get that awesome gaming rig when you get home.  
 * On campus jobs related to your major- such as tutor, lab assistant, etc... You can actually put this one on your resume and look good.  Don't settle for just working the caf or the library (unless you are a culinary or library sciences major). 
 * Busboy/ bartender/ bouncer- at a club. You start as a busboy no matter what, but you can make hundreds (sometimes thousands) in a weekend through tips and getting people 'on the list' to skip the line at a popular club.

Any other suggestions out there for good 'starter' jobs?

With the enormous array of skills available at ones disposal for learning one might begin to wonder the skills which will produce more benefit to him/her the most. Of course no knowledge is a waste but being abreast with the right knowledge for the right purpose will surely produce more profit to its acquirer.

The following skills stated below are ranked as the best skills one can add to his portfolio of knowledge in order to reap the best out of life. You might not really need them for business purposes but they are surely going to save you some cash which you might pay to someone who will carry out that function.

On our list we have the following:-

7. Musical Skill: The ability to play a particular kind of instrument brings joy and happiness to the player and the people around. Aspire to be talented in harnessing a musical instrument or atleast be a good vocalist. The power of music can never be underestimated as it has been known to be able to heal emotional wounds and scars.

6. Carpentry Skills: knowing how to do a little bit of carpentry work will surely save you the extra cost and time of hiring a professional carpenter to do menial carpentry jobs around the house. So much individuals have stated that the found great joy doing menial carpentry jobs around the compound.

5. Driving Skills: You might not own a vehicle but knowing how to pilot one will surely prove helpful. Learn how to drive with good driving ethics. Don't wait for the moment when you finally purchase a car before you do. This is a skill in which its need can come up spontaneously.

4. Tailoring Skills: A certain tribe in Africa buys a sewing machine for their girl ones she gets married. They do this because they believe that every married woman will someday be faced with the problem of patching and sewing clothes for the family. This point is not just exclusive to the female folk but also to the male folk.

3. Hair Making Skills. As a young lady you are expected to know how to plait different styles of hair and as a man be able to barb different hair styles. You might not really be plaiting or barbing your hair but doing this for others surely has its own benefits.

2. Computer skills: civilization and advancement in technology has made this skill a prerequisite. This is the information age and one needs to be acquainted with an above average knowledge of how these technological gadgets functions in order to get the best out of these age. Computer skills are necessary as most industries, business areas, resource centres, etc are now computerised.

1. Good communication skill. This involves both written and oral communication skills. The ability of one to communicate effectively with his immediate environment leads to development.
