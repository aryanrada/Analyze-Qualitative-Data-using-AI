I mean, the world should not even need things like [/r/atheisthavens](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheisthavens) or r/lgbthavens & similar forums.  We have a government that spends billions on military crap yet lets high school students become homeless, with no legitimate ""help.""  And frankly, these youths shouldn't actually need help (in a fair world of affordable land, less regulated building, etc.)  In a world without state-enforced land/housing-investing (by absentee owners) a homeless teen could simply find some unused/unwanted land/lot & build shelter.  (And even start a business.)  But when land itself is used as an investment (non-consensual state-violence against the renters/workers/citizens) it allows the rich to hold the poor ransom with outrageous rents & such.  This (gaining wealth from violence which the workers/renters/etc never consented to) is theft.  (All profits from violence are theft.)   



In other words, the workers/renters/etc never consented to the ownership of the land/industry/natural-resources/housing etc.  The upper classes trade/inherit properties which were ""voluntarily"" claimed often back in the 1800s & 1700s, but that ownership/violence is not consensual to modern people.

http://www.popcenter.org/library/crimeprevention/volume_09/Curtailing_Youth.pdf

>Ostensibly motivated by a desire to reduce youth crime and victimisation, curfews reflect a contemporary preoccupation with achieving social control through the control of space.

We conclude that a discourse of rights provides a particularly strong foundation for arguing against curfews.

What I learned doing research:

* Curfews do not impact overall crime.

* Curfews at night increase crime during the day.

* Curfews are most effective in areas with gang violence.

* Curfews reduce the number of youth arrests.

* Parents enforce curfews more so than police, because they are afraid their child will be arrested.

* Most cities in the United States have youth curfews, and the number is increasing.

Curfews violate:

* The 1st Amendment - ""Congress shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble..""

* The 4th Amendment - ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...""

* The 5th Amendment - ""No person shall.. be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...""

* The 14th Amendment - ""No State shall... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""

In essence, we put 1/4th of entire population under house arrest (unless they have a supervisor with them) for a minimum of 8 hours every day for 18 years.

Bailey changed the name to Lucis Trust. A quick trip to any New Age bookstore will reveal that many of the hard-core New Age books are published by Lucis Trust.
At one time, the Lucis Trust office in New York was located at 666 United Nations Plaza and is a member of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations under a program called ""World Goodwill"". http://www.lucistrust.org/en/service_activities/world_goodwill/purposes_objectives  
In an Alice Bailey book called ""Education for a New Age""; she suggests that in the new age ""World Citizenship should be the goal of the enlightened, with a world federation and a world brain.""
Lucis Trust is sponsored by among others Robert McNamara, former minister of Defence in the USA, president of the World Bank, member of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Thomas Watson (IBM, former ambassador in Moscow). Luci's Trust sponsors among others the following organizations: UN, Greenpeace Int., Greenpeace USA, Amnesty Int. and UNICEF.
Seven years after the birth of the UN, a book was published by the theosophist and founder of the Lucis Trust, Alice Bailey, claiming that ""Evidence of the growth of the human intellect along the needed receptive lines [for the preparation of the New Age] can be seen in the ""planning"" of various nations and in the efforts of the United Nations to formulate a world plan... From the very start of this unfoldment, three occult factors have governed the development of all these plans"". [Alice B. Bailey, Discipleship in the New Age (Lucis Press, 1955), Vol. II, p.35.]
Lucis Trust is the New Age architecture of the UN.

For the last decade we've been handing out mobile phones to children - letting any predator or bully or call centre contact them.

This seems to be a retreat rather than an advance. Prior to the mobile phone children had to use the phone at home - and generally, when a call came to the house, everybody knew who it was from - which made calls from young boys/girls awkward and embarrassing (as it should be at that age - what happened!?).

Surely mobile phone providers are culpable for leaving an entire generation of children vulnerable to social manipulation.

Anyway. At least *somebody* is doing something about it. Controlling who can call a particular phone. Controlling which numbers that phone can call. This is what children *need*.

91,fk0l58,False,None,1,Just why?,YouthRights,"I've always been discredited by my family because of my age, but it took 15 years for me to realize what was going on.

I've always been a ""good kid""--always following the rules, doing well in school, trying hard at everything I do, and most importantly, never disagreeing with my parents. But then when I was 12, I finally decided to come out to my parents as an atheist. Keep in mind, they're both pastors. Up until going through confirmation, I believed. But then, with more information on the Biblical side and more science education in school, I started to believe less and less, and see it more as a fantasy than a reality. This made them extremely angry, and they would stop at nothing to make sure I knew how stupid I was being. They would--and still do--tell me that I'm ""too young to understand"" or that I'm ""uneducated"" and ""naive."" 

I thought that this was normal for all adults and that once I got some more experience, they would finally respect my beliefs. But I agree with them on politics, and they always tell me how proud they are of me being so educated and informed about the topics at hand. I didn't think much of it. After all, it was only one topic, right?

But then I start talking politics with my grandparents and realize that I disagree with them on practically everything. And my grandmother starts to insult my intelligence and utters the infamous, ""You'll understand when you're older,"" phrase. But then my grandfather, who I completely disagree with politically, says that even though he disagrees with me, he thinks that I ""have my head on straight."" That was the first time I had argued with an adult and was shown an ounce of respect.

But then there's this year. Now that I'm 15, I have a few subjects in school that I really enjoy and want to go to every day. One of these is biology. And I am really good at biology. Eventually, my teacher figures this out, and I'm not afraid of him anymore (he was a new teacher, okay? I didn't know what to expect!) And because I'm not afraid of him anymore and he makes mistakes fairly often, I start to correct the things he's done wrong. Instead of pushing me away and disrespecting me like my parents do when I try to correct them, my teacher listens, looks it over, acknowledges that he made a mistake, and fixes it. No adult had ever actually *listened* to me before. 

Now, this is a regular occurrence, but I've started to realize that all of my teachers hold their students to this standard. This is probably not true for all teachers, but it's definitely true for mine. I've corrected four of my six teachers this year, and each one has listened to me. This is something my parents never do when they're wrong, and I don't know why. 

Why tell me that I can't be right because of my age, even though it's an opinion? Or on things you're genuinely wrong about. Why deny that you're wrong? My teachers respect me. My teachers listen to me. Even my grandfather recognizes the difference between fact and opinion. So why do you have to discredit everything I say by telling me I'm too young to understand? I'm not, and you know it. You just don't want me to be a free-thinking individual. Just let me develop my own opinions, and stop trying to control my every move!",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/fk0l58/just_why/,14,"i am religious but my job here is not to steer your faith back to god. i am here to give you confidence.

2. ""if you cant explain it to a stupid person, you dont understand it well enough"" -approximately albert einstein; if they cant explain it to the ""stupid"" you, they dont understand it

the bible does say that god has created us with the gift of free will, so they are violating their own faith by trying to take your free will from you. its your choice, not theirs, period.

anyway, im not sure how this will work out, but you can also talk to other pastors (make sure they are understanding) about your lack of faith and your parents position.

Brief summary:

* They're *democracies*. Every kid gets one vote. The kid literally *hire and fire their own teachers.*
* There's *no curriculum*. Just show up everyday and learn whatever you want to learn. Seriously. So long as it's not downright illegal, learn *whatever you want*.  Learn about jellyfish if that's your thing. Learn about space travel.  Teach yourself guitar or something. Or just hang around and talk to  people! It's all up to you! You have *freedom*.
* There are *no grades*.  If you really want to, you can ask someone to judge your work. But  that's not the default. The default is...just...do stuff. No grades. No  tests. We trust you. It's fine.
* Yes,  Sudbury kids get into college just fine! Turns out colleges are super  open-minded about this. Sudbury schools have been running since 1968 and  they've surveyed adult graduates and they're doing *awesome* (on average, at least).

I  REALLY WISH I HAD GONE TO A SUDBURY SCHOOL WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. If you  are a teenager reading this post, especially if you're creative and  free-spirited and you love learning but you hate the school system, then congratulations, *I am you from the future*. (Not literally, but, ya know, there's a strong parallel here). And I'm telling you, *don't* stress yourself like crazy trying to get good grades in conventional schools. Take care  of your mental health and *seek freedom*.

You're not crazy. The school is crazy.

133,1lvmuw,False,None,7,"Help needed - my friend is imprisoned by her abusive, manipulative parents.",YouthRights,"Hi there,
My friend, who is 16, is a high honor roll student with a spotless record of any wrong doings. She's taking college courses and is expected to graduate high school a year earlier than her peers. She has two older brothers, one 19 year old pill-popping drug dealer (well known, popular drug dealer) who lives out on his own. The other brother is a 22 year old heroin addict who also lives out of the parents house, hopping from one friends house to another. Both brothers have a long history of criminal mischief. Her mother works at a well known University and her father is away for work 90% of the time. They are both absolutely, positively insane. My friend is under lock and key CONSTANTLY and suffers psychological abuse on a daily basis, for the past three years. She has no friends because her parents run full background checks on everyone she comes into contact with. She cannot have friends who have ever had a boyfriend, she cannot have friends that will not give up they're cell phone for inspection upon entering the house. She cannot be friends with anybody that is older than her. She is not allowed to go to family reunions because her mother is afraid of ""being embarrassed"" and she isn't allowed outside for anything other than school. Her mother constantly calls her names, calls her fat and puts her down. Her phone is blocked so she can text only her parents. She has a secret cell phone she messages me off of and that's how we communicate. (No iPods, computers allowed). Her father has a history of drinking and blames her for his habits. He also physically abused her. We got Children and Youth involved which proved to be totally useless. They told her parents ahead of time that they would be coming to ""inspect"" so they had days to prepare a story and clean up the house. The agent spoke to the mother first and believed every single lie that came out of her mouth. They didnt even meet the father, who was away for work. Children and Youth then recommended they just see a family counselor, which her mother never did and C&Y didn't follow up on any of it. Recently, her father was picking her up from her baby sitters house (yep, baby sitter for the 16 year old) and told her to hurry up 'or else' and sent a picture of his gun. She talked to guidance counselors at school and brought up the gun situation. The counselor then called children in youth and has left at least three messages. What can my friend do to get authorities involved that will take her seriously? How can she get out of the house to enjoy a normal life? What can be done about her parents?
Side notes: -she called the police on her drug dealer brother once before, the cops went to the parents and told them she did so (she requested to be anonymous) and the parents went and helped him clean up his apartment and no police investigation ensued. -BOTH brothers are treasured by the parents and they do they're best to keep them out of jail. (They have friends at our local police dept) -her mother won't take her to therapy appointments. -my friend has begged the counselor to tell the next children and youth agent to talk to her first before her mother, but who knows what'll happen.

Defend Northwestern High Schoolers punished for standing up for a better education!

Demand that their suspensions be revoked!

Call Principal Batenga and other school officials - see info below

***

Thursday, March 1st was a National Student Day of Action in which students around the country organized demonstrations protesting education budget cuts, educational inequality, and advocating for quality and affordable education for all.

Students at Northwestern High School in Prince George’s County Maryland planned a walkout and rally as part of the National Student Day of Action. Over 300 students planned to walk out to protest unsanitary conditions in their school, enormous class sizes, cuts to the ESOL program, and denial of promised pay raises for their teachers. The students also were asking for more teacher/parent/student input in the curriculum and demanding an apology for a group of Filipino teachers who were fired and deported after not having their work visas renewed.

**The Administration at Northwestern discovered the walkout plan early in the day by trolling Twitter and put the school on lockdown. Police blocked the doors and canine units waited in the school's parking lot. They held student leaders in the Principal’s office all day, threatened them with expulsion, and at the end of the day suspended four students for 5 days requiring that when they return their parents must accompany them to classes all day.**

Northwestern is a high school where a majority of the students are Black and Latino. The student organizers' mission was to walk out for a better school and a better education. Instead the Administration violated their civil liberties, squashed these students' free speech, and punished them for wanting to improve the school environment for themselves and their teachers. Instead of having a dialogue with students, the Administration at this school chose to make an example of several students and punish them harshly knowing this could affect these students ability to get into college.

We ask you to stand in solidarity with the students at Northwestern. We cannot let school officials succeed in punishing them for wanting changes to their school and quality education. Support these students by contacting the following school officials and demanding that their suspensions be revoked and removed from their permanent record:

Colleagues, 

Above is a solidarity statement for the students who were suspended at Northwestern High in PG County Maryland yesterday. Please send it around far and wide to relevant lists and individuals. 

This is an important fight on multiple fronts. One, we want to win justice for Ricardo, Shane, Will, and Omar - we want their suspensions reversed and no mark on their records. Two, this is about the racist, vastly unequal, bureaucratic and uncaring school system that fails students and teachers every day in this country. The fact that the administration cracked down so hard and so fast on these students shows how afraid those who run this system are of people actually standing up and demanding very basic things - running water in the bathrooms, or sufficient funding for ESOL programs. They would rather call the cops than enter into a civil debate about any of these issues. They immediately resort to force and repression rather than dealing honestly and openly with intelligent and passionate young people fighting for a better future.

The bigger the uproar we can make about this, the more likely these students are to have their suspensions revoked, and the more we can start to crack open the debate about public education in this country and shine a bright light on the disgustingly unequal and repressive nature of our schools.

Peter Lamphere

155,gqhjuf,False,None,4,"My Abuser Caused Me Brain Damage, But I Couldn't Get Out bc It Wasn't Illegal",YouthRights,"I (34f) had a really terrible childhood, mostly being terrorized and harassed a lot by my father, who would rage at me, yelling and spitting through his teeth right in my face, while he physically restrained me. I used to cry about going to school, saying I didn't have friends and was lonely. He would take these vulnerable moments to explain to me that I didn't have friends because no one liked me, because I wasn't a person that people could like. When I was 13, I asked him why he hated me. He said it started when I was 9, and he saw me struggling to keep up running with the other girls on the field, and he just realized that I was gross and embarrassing or something, so he hated me. For more context on that, I was struggling to run because I had asthma. It is a cheap and easy disease to treat, but my dad just honestly interpreted my lung issues and allergies as me being annoying and fat and just a nuisance or something. I didn't see an asthma specialist until I was about 16, and when I did, he told me that I was looking at ending up in a wheelchair before turning 30. Luckily, that didn't happen, I'm 34 and can jog better than I could as a kid, but I just include it to highlight the abnormal level of neglect to my lungs. I think the doctor was actually shocked, and kind of didn't know how I was walking. 

When I was 14, a teacher called CPS, and they came out to see me. They told me if my life was shitty it was my fault and I had to fix it myself. Then they told my mom that she wasn't being a disciplinarian, and that I needed boundaries. After realizing that CPS couldn't help me, I ran away from home at 14. During that time, I was raped, sexually mistreated, abused, exploited, etc., I don't know how many times, because I had to trade sex for shelter. It was kind of stressful and terrifying as well because I was in a dangerous city with a high violent crime rate, and around the type of guys who would hook up with 14 year olds, ie depraved scumbag criminals who literally don't care how they behave or what they do. But even fearing the types of neighborhoods I was in, and the types of guys I was around, it was still a breath of fresh air compared to living with my father. 

When the girl I ran away from home with got picked up by the cops, I got scared to do it all on my own, and I got scared that they'd take me to jail. So I called my mom and she picked me up and brought me home. 

After that I was totally mentally broken, depressed, crazy, gained a lot of weight, my lungs got super messed up (as I mentioned above), I was smoking cigarettes on top of not being able to breathe just because I was so disconnected from my body, pain, and survival instincts; I was terribly bullied in school because of how messed up in physical appearance and mental health I'd become. I also had to attend an alternative school, where I received basically no education. I'd always tested in the 95th percentile and above in English and a couple other subjects (can't remember, but it wasn't math lol) when we did standardized testing in elementary school, and maybe up to about the 7th grade. I remember they had me take the PSAT's in 7th grade, and the counselor told me I'd done 'very well.' I remember her staring at me like I was a total freak that scared her when she told me I'd done 'very well' -- because here I was the psycho kid who still peed their pants in middle school, and was always crying and acting strange, plus a child of color, and I think it didn't make sense to her that I was testing better than all the nice, white, healthy, good kids. I just remember her face was like startled and horrified, like she was actually scared of me for finding out that I wasn't severely cognitively impaired as I must've looked, but I was actually a very cognizant and mentally aware human being. I think it was terrifying to her like finding out the tortured lab monkey is totally mentally present, speaks English, and can read, speak, and reason an advanced level. 

But that didn't really continue. From that point, around 12, my intellectual development began to slip. I quit trying in school, and ended up at an alternative school. I did not receive an education there.

Anyway... in retrospect, now I see that by the time I was 9 I had childhood bipolar disorder, except it wasn't diagnosed til I was about 25. It took me a long time to get any effective treatment. I've spent years on disability, being unable to work. Due to disability-induced poverty, trouble connecting in romantic relationships, and being way too fucking tired to do homelessness actually, I ended up moving back into my abuser's house in my mid-twenties while I tried to sort things out and get help for my psychiatric issues. It was fucking hell to get help. Everything I tried ended up making things worse or having some sort of adverse reaction, or just did nothing to help. I saw horrible community clinic psychiatrists because of poverty and being on Medicaid. But finally I just decided that I was going to look up the best psychiatrists in my area and pay out of pocket to see one. Then finally with someone who wasn't just trying to drug me into catatonic stupor with antipsychotics, and irresponsibly raise my antidepressants (these cause bipolar mania) when I complained of anxiety, I started to finally kind of get a handle on some things for myself. And even work a bit.  

Anyway, I just found out this week that bipolar disorder -- especially with childhood onset, and a more severe and difficult course with it -- is strongly correlated to the type of abuse I suffered. That there's basically a dose-dependent causal effect between traumatic childhood emotional abuse and the development of bipolar disorder. 

I always instinctively knew that my father's abuse of me was giving me nervous breakdowns as a child, and that it had led to one horrible development in my life after another, that so many horror stories in my life, and difficulties in my psychological development, have their etiologies in my father's bizarre obsessive will to daily hurt my feelings and mentally and physically dominate and terrorize me, yet in a way that stopped short apparently of anything CPS would recognize as abuse. He didn't molest me and he didn't punch me. He terrorized the fuck out of me however, daily tormented and brutalized me, completely fucked me up in the head, and basically ruined my life, like... I'm still struggling with a lot of things and I'm 34. I almost can't even believe that when I type it. It's surreal to me. And the thing that's so upsetting to me, I guess, is how easily he got away with it. 

I really want this to change. I think dependent minors need so much more protection and recognition for their humanity. Quality of life doesn't start mattering when you're an adult; it always matters. And being safe in your home, being listened to when you say you need help to get out of an abusive situation... I don't know. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm a little scatterbrained and falling asleep a bit. 

But it's really important to me that childhood verbal and emotional abuse is articulated as a social problem, and that social change and social movements start occurring, as well as changes to laws.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/gqhjuf/my_abuser_caused_me_brain_damage_but_i_couldnt/,14,You are a beloved child of God.

166,1tlni5,False,None,4,My old school had to mace students.,YouthRights,"This is one of the many reasons why youth rights are important to me.

A bit of background:

I went to a high school that a lot of people referred to as ""the black school"" or ""**that** school."" We had a reputation for being dangerous and our graduation rate was around 66% (it is currently at 62.1%) 

Black population of this school was around 51% (white was about 24% and other minorities 25%) despite being the majority, teachers and security were very racist towards black students, even the minority race members of staff discriminated against kids who didn't ""act white"" enough. 

Most of the kids there came from homes that were in worse parts of town and were victims of circumstance, a lot of them were either born into gangs, or joined one. Lots of us had a job/jobs, or had to take care of siblings after school, and didn't have a lot of time to invest in studies. 

Most teachers interpreted this as laziness often making excuses that their homework was only 15 minutes of work, ignoring the 7 other classes we also had work for.

There was (and is,) a strict dress code (basically uniforms,) a metal detector with random selection, and a zero-tolerance policy on almost everything. Students regularly abused the anti-bullying system and would claim other kids bullied them to get people they didn't like suspended or punished. 

There was also a LOT of favoritism going on, and it was easy to get out of punishment if you were white, had good grades/connections, or were involved in sports/curriculars. The teachers would openly converse about sensitive information on other students and flat out ignore you if you needed help unless you were one of the 'good kids.'

Basically the faculty and staff were totally ignorant to our situations and created a very distrusting and hostile atmosphere.

Because there was a very high level of violence at the school, we had our own police, 3-4 of them on staff and at least one was always on premises when the school was open. They did this so outside police wouldn't constantly be coming in and out to arrest gang members, and incidents could be dealt with quickly. 

Literally every year at least one teacher was assaulted, usually trying to break up a fight. It got so bad that they finally decided that any fights that happened were to be dealt with by school police, and all parties would be arrested. Fights were common, and students would crowd around them to watch/videotape, making it hard to get to the students fighting. Usually, the police would mace the fight, aiming for the kids fighting, but accidentally (or not) hitting the crowd in the process.

Naturally kids avoided the fights after a while, sure some would crowd, but as soon as they saw the policeman, they would scatter. Occasionally, spectating was unavoidable. Some hallways were tight, and bathrooms are small. One day I got caught in the line of fire.

My lunch period was known to be rowdy, we would have ""food fights"" at least once a week. (IE kids throwing shit and then throwing more shit while we all made a mad dash out of the cafeteria.) One day, my sophmore year, I was getting lunch and a fight broke out in the line. some girls behind me were arguing, and a crowd gathered, blocking my and a few other kids' path out. When they started getting physical, more people came over to watch and within seconds the cop in the cafeteria appeared and maced the crowd. 

While I wasn't directly hit, the stuff immediately filled my lungs and I started choking and sneezing, almost unable to breathe. My eyes felt like they had cigarette smoke in them, and burned for a good 30 minutes after that. I can't even imagine how it was for the kids that were closer. 

My school's violence problem was dealt with so badly they had to result to macing the students.

This is what happens when you treat kids like they're animals, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1tlni5/my_old_school_had_to_mace_students/,13,"Mace? Isn't that a type of club?

Today (April 8th) as you may know is the [hearing in Takoma Park](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/takoma-park-voting-age-lowered_n_3007487.html) to lower the local voting age to 16. We are launching a voting age campaign, here are the plans:

All day people will be casually tweeting, Blogging and Facebooking about the event. Then at 4:30pm Eastern Time we will start the tweet storm. We will try to get #Votesforyouth to trend on twitter and try to spread the word. **[Twitter pack here](http://pastebin.com/UyttCGUK)**. This should go on for an hour or two. In order to get it to trend, It would be ideal to get at least 100 people tweeting one tweet every 5 minutes. Also, twitter does not count retweets for trending.

At 7:30pm Eastern Time is the hearing. The hearing is at

Takoma Park Community Center  
7500 Maple Ave.  
Takoma Park, Maryland 20912  

If you live in the area and you can come, we strongly encourage you to come. People coming to the event should make small (Think Printing Paper Sized) Posters, as well as other things like buttons. Those who are going are strongly encouraged to use the Profile Picture in posters and buttons. Those who can't come should continue to spread the word online.

196,98gzsw,False,None,0,The Truth About Moving Out Early,YouthRights,"INTRODUCTION

I am here to tell you the truth about moving out early. By ""early,"" I mean at an age before legal adulthood. No, don't ""run away."" Move out. It's not the same thing, and you can move out early if you need to or just very much want to.

SHOULD I?

Only you know that.

You are the world's foremost expert on your own life. Other people may have views, and you may choose to take those views on board, but you are the only person who truly knows the experience of being you and living your life. This is your decision, both inherently and because there's no one better qualified to make it.

WHEN SHOULD I?

If you need to move out, you will want to do so as soon as possible. So when is it possible?

In the practical sense, it's possible when you have a steady income sufficient to take care of your basic needs and a little extra. For most of us, that means a reliable job. In addition to the steady income, you'll need a moving-out fund with enough money to set up your own household in the first place -- for instance, to rent most apartments, you'll need \*two\* months' rent and a damage deposit, so that (for example) an apartment which rents for $800/month may actually cost $1700 to move into. There is plenty of planning and budgeting help available on the Internet, to help you get an idea of how much you'll need.

HOW CAN I?

There are several approaches. First, let's look at this emancipation business.

In a rare example of truthfulness, the process of turning from a ""minor"" into a full citizen is called ""emancipation."" It happens automatically on an arbitrary birthday (the 18th in most U.S. states, but a little higher in a few), but there are other ways to become emancipated. One is emancipation upon marriage. Some states allow this. It's not a good escape plan, though, because you would likely need your parents' permission to marry in the first place.

In more than half the states, there is a legal process through which you can be emancipated by court order. This is difficult, time-consuming, and usually expensive, but it's also inarguable. If that option interests you, here's a web site to start you on the process:

[https://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html](https://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html)

If early emancipation isn't looking too doable, your options are limited. Consider whether you can wait it out, detaching emotionally, saving up money and acquiring skills until you reach the designated birthday. If you simply cannot tolerate it, you have one other option for moving out without being emancipated.

It is this: just do it.

I sought emancipation at 17. When I went for legal advice, the lawyer advised me not to bother with court proceedings. She pointed out -- correctly, as it turned out -- that no cop with an ounce of sense would waste his time retrieving a ""runaway"" who was living in an apartment, working, attending college, and otherwise living a normal life.

That's exactly what I did. I saved money, packed my personal items, and moved into an apartment with a roommate. My mother thought that I ""couldn't"" move out until my eighteenth birthday, as if my age were somehow physically preventing me, and didn't quite know what to do when it turned out that no mysterious force prevented me from signing leases, packing clothing, and performing all the other tasks of moving. 

In some states, this is even legally protected. In Oregon, for example, people become ""young adults"" at age 15, and this comes with a few rights. One is the right not to be kidnapped by your parents. If young Oregonians are in a safe location and prefer to remain where they are, the police will not drag them back to their parents' house just because the parents want them to. In other states, no court has jurisdiction to order you hauled back by force. You really should talk to a lawyer if possible, but if not, you can research the relevant laws yourself \[ [https://teens.lovetoknow.com/What\_Are\_the\_Laws\_on\_Teenagers\_Leaving\_Home](https://teens.lovetoknow.com/What_Are_the_Laws_on_Teenagers_Leaving_Home) \] .

In a few states, this is \*how\* you become emancipated. For instance, Minnesota has no court order of emancipation, but young people are regarded as emancipated once they begin to function as adults \[ [https://www.lawhelpmn.org/resource/emancipation-1?ref=VZwGz](https://www.lawhelpmn.org/resource/emancipation-1?ref=VZwGz) \] . This is a pretty sweet system, because individual Minnesotans can begin living their own lives as soon as they are individually able instead of passively waiting for an arbitrary birthday.

Remember the part where I said that my own moving-out went fairly smoothly, because my mother wasn't sure how to stop me? That's common -- many parents have thought no further than ""you're not allowed,"" and have no backup plan to enforce it -- but it's not universal. Some parents would rather fight than accept, and some have come up with fairly effective methods.

They may physically trap you in their home, for example. This is a terrible shame, because there's really no way to interact with them as family after they've done that. At that point, you must regard them as your captors. If there's a chance your parents might do this, you must keep your moving-out supplies and funds either off-site or on your person, and you mustn't tell them where you'll be living. This stinks, in part because it does start to feel like ""running away"" instead of moving out, but if you're being held prisoner by anyone, any self-respecting person should try to escape.

I heard of a young woman whose parents did this. She then moved out in the earliest morning, to an unknown location, leaving a letter saying that she might contact them after her eighteenth birthday. She did write to them when nineteen years old, but apparently still doesn't feel safe seeing them in person (and I don't blame her, since they used the letter to stir up their ""missing person"" case again). It's a shame that they can't even see each other at Christmas, but the parents wanted a war, and they got one.

I heard of another young woman whose parents forced her to move back in with them by wrecking her life. They showed up at her workplace and caused scenes, repeatedly, until she was fired. When she found another job, they simply did it again. Eventually she was forced to move back in with them because she couldn't keep a job and so couldn't pay her rent. The only other option she saw was homelessness.

She did have other options. If she had understood that her parents were declaring war and that she had to fight back to defend herself, she could have documented their harrassment, and then charged them with harrassment and/or sought a restraining order. She could also have moved to a different city, so that they couldn't harrass her so easily. I don't look down on her for not having the strength and energy to win that war -- nobody wins them all -- but I mention these other options as a way of pointing out that options usually exist.

Pettier harrassment is fairly common. My mother used to call every night to try to push me into eating dinner at my parents' house. Literally. Every. Single. Night. The goal was presumably to harrass me until I gave in, then continue pushing me into living more and more of my life under her roof, until my own apartment sat empty. Instead, I simply stopped answering the phone during the relevant block of time.

Other family members may be enlisted to try to make you feel guilty for hurting or abandoning or whatevering your parents. They are unlikely to listen to reason, so you're probably better off with non-responses like ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" If they won't stop, you may need to minimize contact with your relatives until they've learned to accept the new reality.

In conclusion, you can move out at any age. Often it's even legal, but even when it isn't, it's possible. If it's what's best for you -- and you are the \*only\* person who can know that -- then make your own choice and go for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/98gzsw/the_truth_about_moving_out_early/,14,,2018-08-19 02:19:06

Tony Robbins and Ben Shapiro, as well as teen actors and actresses are good examples of people who have matured mentally early on. If you've ever seen their interviews or their work history, they've been active in the more adult realm for much of their early life, and so tend to have more adult conversations and behaviors, if they are still inexperience and lacking in nuance of ideas.

I mean, tony Robbins was making something of himself, Ben Shapiro was writing columns and then books at 16-22, etc. Scott Devine, another great example of someone who started young in life, hanging out in adult crowds and turning into a great musician.

The ageist insults are aimed at the fact that most people tend to stay stunted. Its no wonder as society says that ""you aren't an adult until you're 18"", there's a large volume of social messages that repeatedly hammer you with being ""just a kid"" until that time. Rather than growing up, you're supposed to stay in ""the age appropriate stage"" until an arbitrary date passes for your chronological age.

When someone uses an ageist insult, it is meant to either denigrate someone by saying they're at a tier of age stage far below what they should be, or to denigrate someone young for belong to a group which is supposed to conform to certain stereotypes.

>After about ten acts of stubborn defiance, followed by ten switchings, he surrendered his will to one higher than himself. In rolling the wheel, he did what every accountable human being must do-he humbled himself before the ""highest"" and admitted that his interests are not paramount. After one begrudged roll, my wife turned to other chores.

Children trying to defend themselves from physical assault is seen as insubordinate.

Why are a ten year olds views and wishes less valid then an 18 year olds?

330,l6yek,False,None,32,What do you guys think of the age of consent?,YouthRights,"I lost my virginity at 14, and when my parents found out, they threatened to put my boyfriend in jail. I still don't regret the decision, as I haven't gotten pregnant since then, and I feel I was mature enough to handle it.

I'm married now (to a different guy), but I'm still only 17, which means that technically my husband can be jailed for possessing nude pictures of me.

What does r/YouthRights think about this issue?",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/l6yek/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_age_of_consent/,10,"I know this is an old thread, but you folks don't seem to have many readers or much activity, so I figure someone's still browsing it.

Are you in the US?  I thought that here in the States, at least, most of the states, you could not be legally married if you were under 18.

That's not to say you can't get married.  I mean, marriage is just a piece of paper, financial obligations, tax breaks and a metal band after all (unless you're of the religious influence I suppose?).  That just means that the state and federal governments would not recognize the marriage until both parties turn 18.  It probably doesn't affect either participant in the relationship, though, since most teens aren't full-time employees with a meaningful tax status.

As far as the age of consent, I lost my virginity before I was 17.  I think I was 15 or maybe 16?  Been a while...  Anyway, the age of consent isn't really something that's there to say ""you're ready for sex at 17.  No younger, no older.""  It's really there to keep pervs from abusing emotionally and mentally immature people.  Our brains develop, in some cases, into our early 20's, so it's fair to assume that the tip of the bell curve in means of emotional and intellectual maturity, someone who is 16 years old is immature and can be taken advantage of.

I don't see a problem with that part.  When people start abusing the system to put otherwise innocent people in jail, then it starts being an issue.  Unfortunately, if you are under 18 your parents can decide to press charges against your will.  That seems incorrect.  If the participants relative to the sexual relations decline the right to press charges, then the case should be tossed out.


A lot of folks have brought up voting as well.  I will say this:  my views turned around in my early twenties.  I mean, my views on basically everything.  Getting out of college and gaining some experience in the real world while making it on my own really taught me some things.  I do believe that teens don't have the real-world experience to sort out their thoughts yet, so maybe voting should remain delayed until you are 18.

In high school it's easy to form opinions on many things, but without actually experiencing those things you can't really have a true idea of what they are.  For example, as you will find out I'm sure, you can have the nicest, shiniest degree in your field along with a perfect 4.0 GPA and as more references than you can count, but it doesn't mean shit to anyone until you have some experience in your field.  

Learning about something does not make one an expert.  Learning about a thing only lends knowledge about its topic.  That knowledge was likely imbued with some sort of bias, since it was taught and not experienced.  Once you experience that thing for yourself, only then can you have a true feeling for what it envelopes and form your own, personal opinions.  

Like I said, my views have changed on EVERYTHING since I was a teenager and those alterations came from experience. ",2011-10-10 11:12:06

Feminist movement was the first movement for social justice in this society to call attention to the fact that ours is a culture that does not love children, that continues to see children as the property of parents to do with as they will. Adult violence against children is a norm in our society. Problematically, for the most part feminist thinkers have never wanted to call attention to the reality that women are often the primary culprits in everyday violence against children simply because they are the primary parental caregivers. While it was crucial and revolutionary that feminist movement called attention to the fact that male domination in the home often creates an autocracy where men sexually abuse children, the fact is that masses of children are daily abused verbally and physically by women and men. Maternal sadism often leads women to emotionally abuse children, and feminist theory has not yet offered both feminist critique and feminist intervention when the issue is adult female violence against children.

This is what discomforts me about this kind of advice. It is feel as though the impetus behind this kind of advice is that being a ""youth"" has little value other than as a stepping stone to ""adulthood"".


This feels invalidating to my own agency, and actually gets me down a little bit. I don't feel respected by my elders because I am younger than them. No matter how hard I try, I will be expected to behave like a youth until for one reason or another they see me as an ""adult"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/2l7irf/separate_lives_for_youthhood_and_adulthood/,7,"I think it will help if you translate ""while you are young"" into ""before you get married and/or have kids"".

It simply makes me proud. But what have I've done? Well, I have occupied my entire time focusing on how to expand youth rights, spoken and gotten the written support of several politicians, and has bring together several youth rights organizations to unite in favor of the Youth Rights Cause.

Now, it's time that I look to a brighter future. A future filled with joy and happiness, and a National Youth Rights Campaign filled with support and dedication. That's what I have been planning for, and will start doing this year. Come on people, are we all in support of youth rights? Do we all want to see the expansion of it? Because it's easy to write a post saying you support it! So are you down with me? If you aren't, don't bother replying, if you are, here's the ball plan folks. 

We are going to cut the crap and get to work. No more play time. We will start focusing on what's important and start a successful campaign! Now, we will start by raising funds against ageism and age discrimination, recruit volunteers and staff, and throughout 2015, we will peacefully fight for youth rights! Lobby! Protest! Walk-outs! Student empowerment, whatever interests you! 

Now, there is no central or hierarchical leadership to this campaign or body. Everyone is in control of what happens with the movement. There will simply be campaign managers and staff, but everyone controls their piece of the battle. It's time to do something! Rather than talk and play around about youth rights folks! And if you are ready to be apart, then stand by me at the front line!

Where are our Super PACs, our lobbyists? What politicians answer to our movement?

People like Mark Zuckerburg and Elon Munsk became successful when they were young. They know what it is like to overcome adultism. How can we make people like them pay into a public presence for our cause?

Business should be supporting us too, for their own interests as well as ours. For example, if minors could open up their own bank accounts, the banks would be able to compete for their patronage and brand loyalty. Minors would get financial independence, banks would get customers; everybody would win.

Youth rights is unpopular. If we are going get into the mainstream, we need real capital, real power. Lets discuss how to get these things.

437,m6xog,False,None,11,An unused policy statement on student rights,YouthRights,"**STUDENT RIGHTS**

As students, Americans are taught that nothing can compel young people to ""shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.""  Yet our schools and universities still fall short of this legally-mandated promise.  Educational institutions cannot benefit students if we lack even a token say in our surroundings.  Though it is mandatory for most of us to attend school, we find ourselves deprived of rights during the school day without even the opportunity for recourse.

Throughout NYRA's extensive history of defending student rights, we have opposed a long list of damaging actions by school districts and faculty, including: cell phone bans, electronic monitoring, unusual punishments, and unreasonable searches.  We find it inherently wrong to censor student publications, library materials or schoolwork.  We monitor malicious interference with school newspapers and fairly elected student governments, which is disturbingly common.  NYRA also works against uniforms and dress codes, which are not only ineffective and expensive to implement, but serve to infringe upon the personal lives of students and their families.

Barbaric ideas such as corporal punishment, strip searches and degrading treatment have no place in an educational environment.  All citizens, including young people, should expect physical autonomy and freedom from violence and abuse.  Corporal punishment policies — otherwise absent from our legal system — are still carried out by biased and untrained faculty, and fall disproportionately on disadvantaged populations.  NYRA believes that the practice of paddling, hitting, striking or any other form of corporal punishment in our schools violates a young person's inherent right to freedom from cruel or inhumane treatment.  Corporal punishment has been banned from much of America, but over [100,000+] students were paddled last year [in these states--popup].

We also find that grade schools regularly assign pointless, mandatory homework given by unmotivated teachers with dislike or disdain for young people.  The stereotype of lazy students who are averse to work is matched by real-life scenarios of insensitively large and irrelevant school workloads.  Standardized test requirements or simple societal pressures may also force teachers to pile on assignments in place of more effective, less quantifiable teaching methods.  

We instead encourage grades that acknowledge all forms of student achievement, such as the [different systems used](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/weekinreview/28tyre.html) in Austin, Minnesota public schools.  Report cards that manipulate fair criteria or award students primarily for compliance, like Mount Olive (N.J.) High School's [attempt to fail students](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/education/08grades.html) who don't receive an A, cheats students and threatens their future success.  The growth of programs that encourage student-directed, transparent and less restrictive models of teaching, such as Waldorf and Sudbury schools, is promising — as is any attempt to change our outmoded educational system. 

It is fundamental for schools and universities to be transparent in all of their actions, especially regarding discipline.  Too often innocent and startled students are subject to group punishment or judged without a chance to adequately defend themselves.  NYRA believes that students must be afforded due process with clear disciplinary codes that minimize any rush to judgment.  Just as students are not the property of their parents, they are also independent of their schools.  Schools are built for us — and ideally, we ought to have an equal voice in school governance.  

If schools are to prepare students for the ""real world,"" they must afford us all of the freedoms that other members of society have, including how to think, behave and otherwise express ourselves.  Students generally should not be prevented from taking any action that persons outside of school would otherwise be allowed to do in a normal workplace.  Schools should not be places where free expression is defended first and foremost, not demeaning or overbearing in any way.  

Specifically, from 2005 to 2007, NYRA led over 100 young people representing multiple youth rights organizations in drafting a model Student Bill of Rights.  A broadly defined vision of our future, it called for schools to protect;

>freedom of existence and belief; freedom of expression; self-management, self-control and self-leadership; physical safety and support; separation of school, home and community; privacy; fair, equitable adequate and appropriate learning; democratic participation, and; participation in school sponsored activities.

An empowered student body in a transparent school district does not threaten the authority of teachers or the operation of schools—and yet even if it did, that would hardly be sufficient reason for preventing young people from conducting themselves in whatever manner they deem fit simply due to their age.  Students of all ages are capable of phenomenal things, and can be as capable as persons outside of the educational system in many regards.  NYRA believes that the opinions of students in all aspects of school should be given the utmost weight.

*Hey, r/yr. I drafted this position paper for NYRA in winter of 2009 (or thereabouts). It was supposed to be part of a series of basic policy statements for our new website, which was delayed, and then the series never got off the ground...so its sat on my hard drive since then and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

446,hv478,False,None,3,Minnesota town considers installing anti-youth screeching machine; NYRA gears up to fight,YouthRights,"**The original article:**

The southeastern Minnesota town of Hastings may try to solve a vandalism problem in an out-of-the way park by installing a noise machine to repel teenagers.

The city is considering installing the SonicScreen technology in Cari Park, a frequent target for vandals who are assumed to be teenagers.

SonicScreen emits a high-pitched screech at a frequency young people can hear but older folks with less-sensitive hearing can’t.

“For young people, it sounds like 15 or 20 people dragging their nails down a chalkboard,” said Jeff Webber, owner of Webber Recreational Design, which would install the device.

Webber told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that if Hastings installs the SonicScreen — made by MiracleTech Security of New Jersey — it would be the first such system installed in Minnesota.

The technology is similar to devices designed to repel rodents by emitting noises at frequencies humans can’t hear.

Shilpi Banerjee, president of the Minnesota Academy of Audiologists, said SonicScreen works because most adults start to lose their high-frequency hearing in their 20s.

Hastings Park and Recreation director Barry Bernstein said Cari Park has been frequent target for vandals. The park is surrounded by homes so police officers it can’t see it from the street. It has no lights.

Vandals have scrawled graffiti on equipment, defecated in the play tunnels and set fire to one of the structures. Bernstein said the city is installing new playground equipment and wants to protect it.

Bernstein also is considering lights, video surveillance and even a machine that would shout at trespassers who tripped a motion detector.

“It could say something like, `Hey, you aren’t supposed to be here!”‘ he said.

But the SonicScreen is the most high-tech solution on the table, even if there’s a low-tech way to beat it. When asked if vandals could just wear earplugs, Webber paused and said, “I imagine that would work.”

But that would require planning — something most vandals don’t do, he said. “Vandalism is typically a spur-of-the-moment decision,” Webber said. “There is not a lot of forethought.”

The city parks and recreation commission is expected to vote on the matter June 14 and forward its recommendation to the full City Council.

**NYRA's response, sent to town officials and written about in the local paper;**

Dear Mr. Bernstein,

I read with dismay this morning that your department is considering installing a ""SonicScreen"" device with the purpose of preventing vandalism at Cari Park in Hastings. This device, and others with similar function, unabashedly discriminate on the basis of age. I do not mean to deter you from preventing vandalism in your community and appreciate that you're pursuing innovative methods - but discriminating against an entire group of people based on the actions of individuals is prejudicial and not the proper way to address issues like vandalism. Despite the actions of a select few, teenagers are not pests to be repelled.

There is no evidence that these devices actually work to deter crime, nor has your department shown sufficient evidence that the culprits in this instance are, in fact, teenagers. Furthermore, the discriminatory device runs afoul of the spirit of Minnesota's Human Rights Law.

These devices lack precision and can effect a wide variety of innocents. In particular, autistic children and children with special hearing needs will be needlessly asaulted by this sonic weapon. Even though I am supposedly over the required age I can usually hear these devices. There is no guarantee that this device will deter any vandals while there is guarantee that countless citizens will be adversely affected. Should you choose to install this device it will be particularly egregious since you will be violating the civil rights of a group of people who had no say in the decision.

Last fall, my organization ran a successful campaign to remove a similar device, this one called ""the Mosquito,"" from the Gallery Place Metro Station in Washington, DC. Ultimately, the DC Office of Human Rights determined that the device was discriminatory and illegal. It is my hope that your office will make a just decision on this matter.

* Your right to travel is limited. You need a judge's permission to travel alone. (Checked sources and people aged 2 to 11 need authorization from a government organ to travel alone, while people aged 12 to 18 need identification documents to travel alone.

You have to undo 100 years of Victorian protestant purity. You have to convince people that children are just as capable as adults of making decisions for themselves. You have to get rid of the idea that children are the property of their parents. How do you do this? The same way as anything else.

474,2gicnk,False,None,13,High School should not require a specific set of classes.,YouthRights,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am currently a college student who has suffered through all of the useless classes which are required in high school.

By the time a student reaches high school, they already know how to read, write, and do simple math. So thus, while core classes should still be offered, they should be optional. One of the most useless classes which I was ever forced to take in high school was Geometry. I am well aware that some people love math, but I am not one of those people. My favorite class was Social Studies, but I am well aware that there are many students who hated social studies as much as I hated math.

My solution is to make all classes optional and allow students to choose the classes which they want to take. Many people will argue that ""a person needs math in case they want to be an engineer."" But a simple response to that common argument is that if a student wants to be an engineer, than they should take math, if they don't want to be an engineer they don't have to take math.

Another argument which I foresee many people making is that ""you need to take core classes to get into a good college."" While some colleges do have strict admissions requirements, many colleges do not. In the United States of America, as long as you graduate high school, you will get into college, even if its not a ""good"" college.

On a side note, I would like to point out that almost all colleges have general education requirements, which is why it lasts for four years. Colleges should also eliminate general education requirements.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/2gicnk/high_school_should_not_require_a_specific_set_of/,6,">Many people will argue that ""a person needs math in case they want to be an engineer."" 

I don't think this is the argument at all.  Rather, the argument is that we live in a world that is often times describe best using mathematical tools.  Thus, if we are going to equip children to best handle the world that they find themselves in, we should teach them math.

The idea of K-12 education is to provide the students with a basic set of tools for approaching the world.  Math is a key tool -- and geometry a key component of that toolbox.  

In the same way, reading and writing are very basic tools for the modern world. 

It is very difficult to imagine a situation where you will not require reading and writing -- and the better you read and write the better off you will be in *almost* any job.

The same goes for math.  It may be hard to believe, being as young as you are (assuming, from the fact you are in college), but basically *every* job is helped by an understanding of mathematics.  And in the real world, which appears to be 3-dimensional, geometry is a great tool to have.   ",2014-09-15 23:44:59

I was browsing Buzzfeed and I clicked on this post:

http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbellassai/reasons-why-kids-and-animals-should-never-mix

""Reasons why kids and animals shouldn't mix"" the post is mainly just gifs of bad interactions between kids and animals.

More than half of the gifs are children being either intentionally hit or unintentionally knocked over by animals. There are a few where a child is holding a cat badly and 1 where a child is intentionally mistreating an animal (the last gif where ""honey boo boo"" is shaking a chicken).

The top thumbed up comment on this article is that parents need to stop their kids from mistreating animals all the time, the comment is not that parents need to be responsible to keep both animals and kids safe -- even though there are more gifs of kids being hurt by animals than vice versa on this post.

In one gif a monkey intentionally kicks a child in the face*. One comment says ""good monkey"" and has 2 thumbs up. If one of the gifs was a child intentionally kicking an animal in the face I am pretty confident there would be at least 3 comments wanting that child to die and many more with extreme levels of rage.

The post also includes some images where children are literally doing nothing but being near an animal and the caption says something ""jokingly"" about how horrible the child is.

I know there were comments defending children on that article and speaking up for them but the amount of delight in children getting hurt and in hating and blaming them for anything is just beyond.

* I think that monkey is very likely abused and mistreated and I understand being glad the monkey is ""fighting back"" but the small child is not the one keeping the monkey captive, is not the one that even decided to help continue that profit stream. If a child that had been abused had kicked an innocent cat nobody would laugh and comment ""good kid!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1mga5i/cannot_stand_the_level_of_child_hatred/,7,"I have seen this behavior myself. The pictures were definitely difficult to look at. It seems that children are the last acceptable group for us as a culture to vent our hatred on. An important thing to remember though is that most adults have had lest than ideal childhoods, and are unconsciously projecting their own unresolved traumas onto the next generation. (In my opinion trauma can be more then physical.) This by no means excuses their behavior. The responsible thing for adults to do is connect with their past and heal the child within themselves before having children. Of course, this is easier said then done. Sometimes I think that it wouldn't be a bad idea if you had to have a licence to have children. All that being said I completely understand your response to this. Sometimes I wonder if a campgain similar to the ones feminists have done against rape culture would be effective or not. Something like ""Don't be *that* kind of adult"" that would shine the light on Adultism. As this is clearly what this is. ",2013-09-15 20:24:57

486,185aa9,False,None,2,10 Reasons Why Being a Mean Parent Doesn’t Work,YouthRights,,http://www.findananny.net/blog/10-reasons-why-being-a-mean-parent-doesnt-work/,8,"This is completely vague and unhelpful.

I'm a dad of two little girls. I've always been a strong advocate of treating kids with respect and honor - they are, after all, no less human beings than any adult.

However, there *is* a learning curve here. I'm a firm believer that if most parents would just spend more time with their kids, that alone would sort out most discipline problems. I see this in my own kids. We don't own a television - instead, we read books together. I write stories with them. We play games. We go outside to the park. I spend a lot of time with them outside of work, and my wife is a stay-at-home mom.

At the same time, there are some things that they decide to do that are completely unacceptable. The oldest cannot hit her sister. It is unacceptable to throw toys at us when it's time to eat dinner and they don't like the food being served. It is unacceptable to steal toys from other children.

My wife and I try very hard not to become angry and blow up in these situations. We tell our children to go sit on the bed for a bit and think about what they've done. This also gives us time to cool off. Then we go in and sit down with them, explain to them that what they did was wrong, that it was hurtful, and that they ought not do it.

Sometimes that works.

Sometimes, they decide to start screaming at us.

Sometimes, they tell us they won't do it, again - and then they make it into a habit.

Any number of things can happen.

So sometimes, I have to sit them down again - and talk to them. And sometimes, we have to confiscate things. We have to discipline.

Our children are usually extremely well behaved. But when we do have to discipline them, they definitely think we're being mean. They think it's unfair. They think we're enforcing rules that just don't make sense.

Now, I'm completely willing to hear their side of the argument. I *want them* to tell me why they think I'm wrong, why they think they should be allowed to act as they have.

But ultimately, as the parents, I *do* have to make decisions - not only for their wellbeing, but also for the wellbeing of others. They simply cannot be allowed to harm others or take the possessions of others or things like that.

Am I mean to discipline? Am I mean to sit down and ""force"" them to have a conversation about these things?

I've been chastised by psychologists for my ""mean"" parenting before. Even though I'm quite certain I grant our kids a great deal more freedom than most parents probably do. I also expect them to act responsibly and loving toward others as a result of the freedom that's been granted to them. And I will not hesitate to speak with them about how we ought to act toward our fellow men and women.

Different kids require different parenting techniques, though. I think our approach to parenting is quite modest in terms of the discipline we actually mete out. I know others who have to be a bit heavier with the discipline. Some basically don't have to discipline their kids at all.

If I'm an adult, and I steal or harm another person, that will result in my own discipline. I am uncertain why such rules shouldn't apply (to some extent) within the household. I don't think that makes parents mean. That makes them good parents who are trying to raise decent human beings.

I would like to know what parents *should* be doing more than what people have a problem with them doing. And I'd like to know *specifics*. If they're suggesting that beating your kid is wrong - well, hell, I agree with that 100%. But if they're saying that even modest forms of discipline are ""mean"" - I absolutely disagree.

Anyway. Those are my thoughts. I don't think it's a very helpful article. I'd love to see something like this with real substance, though. It could be very interesting. ",2013-02-08 19:05:37

493,111p1v,False,None,11,Discrimination Experiment,YouthRights,"As you all probably know already, reddit has a bit of a problem when it comes to discrimination. Ageism is as usual the most socially acceptable form of irrational sweeping discrimination. Offending users do not even feel the need to be subtle about it. The next type is sexism, though this tends to take on more subtle forms. Racism appears to be rare outside of dedicated joke subreddits like /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, but occasionally there *will* be a racial generalization circlejerk that hits the frontpage. I hardly see any homophobia, but I do remember seeing some vitriol directed to the T in LGBT. I don't see much serious ableism going on, but occasionally redditors will use words like ""retard"" as a synonym for stupid.

So to help people recognize discrimination of the nature they often overlook, I will try an experiment. I will transpose the overlooked discrimination with another type of discrimination that appears more blatant and offensive. Here a couple examples.

Original:

>I am so sick of all these teenagers degrading the quality of content here.

Transposed:

>I am so sick of all these *blacks* degrading the quality of content here.

Original:

>Frankly, only pussies would like this shit. Seriously, how retarded do you have to be to hop on this bandwagon?

Transposed:

>Frankly, only *chinks* would like this shit. Seriously, how *homosexual* do you have to be to hop on this bandwagon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/111p1v/discrimination_experiment/,6,"Comparisons like this just tend to send people into rage mode and cause them to stop listening. It's obvious to you and me that discrimination is bad, but you need to be a bit more subtle if you want to convert others.

For instance, a homosexual who is ageist would probably get really mad at you for daring to compare ageism to homophobia. But you might have better luck if, for example, you pointed out that parents are still legally able to punish their children for being gay.

So, I admire your enthusiasm, but at the very least you're wasting your time; at the most you might actually be hurting the cause. ",2012-10-06 16:39:00

I am fairly new to the community that is youth rights, but it has been a topic I've written and talked about for the last 2 years. I was navigating through this thread and the relevant links (National Youth Rights Association and Youth Rights Network). Both of those websites look ancient and practically empty. The handful of articles on them (on lowering the voting age and drinking) are good, but not gonna do very much.

The [accomplishments](http://www.youthrights.org/whatwevedone.php) that YouthRights.org have accomplished in their last 13 years of existence is pathetic. 

No law changes, a small handful of endorsements, a few local tv appearances, and payment for their executive director. 

How can we expect people to represent us when we have such a weak lobby?

Youth rights affect everyone. Everyone eventually grows up. Many grow up broken and bitter because of how they were treated growing up. Once they are out, they don't look back and allow treatment to get worse for the young under them.

We must be more vocal. High Schoolers, when you head back to school, write articles for your school paper. Talk to administrators about increased powers of student government. Make it clear to the adults in power when you feel they are abusing their power and their relationship.

Don't just accept curfews. Let them know how good children still deserve to play in the streets past 9PM. No one should be afraid of their local police for playing midnight soccer on the weekends.

Troubled Teen camps - Even if you don't know anyone who personally went there, bring this up. I didn't even know these existed until two months ago, but [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/hk0xy/a_gay_teen_describes_her_experience_at_a_utah/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/i369v/wilderness_programs_lockdowns_and_reform_ranches/) made me man-cry harder than I have in a long time.

Write to your congressman, then publish it to your facebook. Make your friends aware of what they are missing - spread the conversation.

We don't have money. We don't have political influence. And many of us currently don't have voting rights. But it's time we pulled our shit together.

I am in University in Philadelphia. Here, there are violent youth mobs that attack locals indiscriminately. The loudest voice has been to mass criminalize these teens, lock them away, zero tolerance.

527,c85od7,False,None,1,Abuse of Children in Behavioral Modification Cults,YouthRights,"
My name is Emily Carter and I am currently a student at the University of Idaho. Im 20 now but from February 2014 to May 2015, I was brainwashed, emotionally, physically and verbally abused at a boarding school for ""troubled girls"" in Montana. The school was called Clearview Horizon and was an offshoot of a school called Spring Creek Lodge that was shut down in the early 2000s after a girl killed herself on campus.

 We experienced various methods of torture that were forced on us to make us conform. We were subjected to cult practices that were created in the 1980s by a group called Lifespring that subsequently had many lawsuits for trauma sustained by adults who paid and consented to participate in the seminars. These same processes are being used on non-consenting children who are punished if they don't participate. It was a behavioral modification school and it has inflicted so much pain and C-PTSD on so many girls and I really need your help. We have been working on getting the general mass media interested in this issue because it is so far reaching and has hurt so many people. 


We lost one of our girls to suicide after she left Clearview and I am really scared that we may lose more members of our sisterhood the longer this goes on. Clearview recently opened a new campus in Idaho and some staff left and created another school in Montana. There are multiple lawsuits against the new school (Reflections) for sexual abuse and other fraud. 20 other girls and I looked into what it would take to sue Clearview and hopefully shut them down, but the statute of limitations expired when most of us turned 20 or 21. The local news in Montana has done a series on these schools, but people from all over the US are still sending their kids there. 

I share all of this with you in hope of showing what happens in schools like these and specifically Clearview Horizon https://www.clearviewhorizon.com/ and Reflections Academy https://reflections.academy/ are unnacceptable centers of abuse, and that Michelle ""Mickey"" Manning, Mike Linderman, and Kimberly Sparks should have no contact with children in a therapeutic capacity ever again. 

Here are some of the articles from the local news, some links to what these processes are like and what they do to people psychologically. My personal experience at Clearview, and the testimonies of other girls and parents who were manipulated by Clearview are attached. The testimonies were used to support a bill that ended up getting passed so these programs cannot regulate themselves anymore, however, programs succeeded in effectively gutting the bill before it was passed.

My detailed abuse:

Emily Lynn Carter
Attended Clearview from February 2014 to May 28th, 2015.
Elcarter2424@gmail.com

Tuition cost: My parents paid $6,000 per month to go to Clearview, my insurance was billed for some therapy sessions.


Abusive and Psychologically Detrimental Events from Clearview
•	Healthcare
o	Lack of Access to Adequate Healthcare: Most complaints of health problems were not taken seriously and were seen as manipulation. A lot of girls have had to have surgery after leaving to deal with physical problems that were not addressed at Clearview.
o	Unsafe Runaway Recovery: When a girl would run away from the program, girls who had been there for a while would be forced to chase after them. Girls were commonly threatened and in one case shot at for being on someone else’s property looking for a girl. One girl came back with her thigh torn opn as the result of chasing someone through a barbed wire fence. I lived in fear that I would one day ber forced to run around in the woods in the dark, chasing some scared girl.
•	Mental Health/Safety
o	Lack of Access to Emergency Services: One of the first things that I noticed at Clearview was that there was no way to tell anyone what was happening in the program. I wasn’t allowed to speak to my parents for a few months and when I did, the calls were monitored and could be turned off at any time if they thought I was “manipulating”. We were only allowed to write emails to our parents and the staff would read them and send them for us and make us take out anything that was “manipulative”. We didn’t have access to a phone if we needed to call 911, there was no way to contact a lawyer or child advocate, there was no way to get any type of help. I considered starving myself enough to be hospitalized so that I could tell a lawyer what was happening.
o	Forced Dangerous Exercise as Punishment: Almost all of our punishments were physical in nature. One write-up (which you could get for forgetting you laundry basket or not taking out milk from the freezer) was 10 hills in a gravel pit that was incredibly steep. In the winter, it would be covered with ice and you would slip and slide all the way up and down which resulted in injuries. I fell numerous times and got hurt. I only ever had about 30 hills at a time when some girls had hundreds. They would do hills all day and often instead of school work. Each write-up also came with 2 hours of labor, so again, the most I ever had at one time was 6 hours. I was forced to regravel the driveway with a wheelbarrow. I have had serious back problems all my life and this hurt my back so bad. The pain was excrutiating. The hills would also hurt my back badly after the first ten. I would try and stretch out the pain, but the way my spine is built, I should never have been doing exercise like that. Any complaints about pain or injuries were seen as manipulating and you would get yelled and and just have to go back to work. 
o	Isolation: When a girl seemed to be “dragging people down with her” they would sometimes be put on Black Cloud. If you were on Black Cloud, no one was allowed to look at you or talk to you. I was told to completely ignore the existence of people on Black Cloud. One of my friends was on Black Cloud for months and had to stay outside in a tent. It was incredibly troubling to have to ignore her and pretend like she wasn’t there.
o	
o	Fear/Manipulation Based “Treatment”: 
	Vote-Ups: There are four levels in Clearview. Level 1 is resistant, Level 2 is Open, Level 3 is initial, and Level 4 is internalized. Everyone would come in at a level 2 and if you were bad you would get dropped to Level 1. When you got to Level 4 you could “graduate” and go home. If you wanted to move up a level, you would have to get signatures from staff and then stand in front of all the girls and some staff and get feedback. Feedback was a way of verbally tearing girls down, exposing the bad things they did, humiliating them, and occasionally giving constructive criticism. If a girl didn’t like someone, they could not support them for the next level, therefore keeping them there longer. It was incredibly humiliating and nerve wracking. When I voted up to Level 3, they made me give all of the Level 1’s feedback, bascially tear them down in front of the group. If I hadn’t done it, I would not have gotten to vote up and would have had to stay there longer. I still feel really bad about the things I said to those girls.
	Feedback: Commonly, when girls voted up, Mickey Manning would take that as an opportunity to verbally abuse girls. She would commonly tell them that they were bitchy, entitled, slutty, whores, and that they should take accountability for everything in their life, including their own sexual assaults. Seeing this happen to my friends and the girls that I loved was incredibly traumatizing. It made me terrified that Mickey would one day say that to me about my sexual abuse and blame me for it. It broke my heart to see girls treated like they were worthless, which was something we were always taught. Mickey would always call us “liars, cheats, and theives”. She would forget things that happened and then call girls liars and manipulators, even though we all knew what happened. 
	Processes: The processes that we were forced to go through were some of the most brutal, manipulative, and cult-like behavior I have ever seen and I suffer from increased anxiety and PTSD from them (in addition to everything else that happened at Clearview).
•	Stretch Weekend: The process that I remember as the most horrific was the Lifeboat process. They took all of us girls that had been there for a while and sent the new girls on a camping trip. They kept us in the sweltering work out room for the whole day and began to abuse us. We were first forced to stand up and talk about what we hated about ourselves and how everything was going. We were forced to focus on the bad things and then pick a degrading name from who we were before program and they called us that name for the rest of the day. It’s one thing to be upset with yourself, but to have someone else, a therapist, use that to taunt, chastise, and bully you is really horrifying. We were broken down continually until they decided to get to the main process. We were made to believe that we were on a boat and it suddenly hit something and started sinking. We were given 30 seconds to a minute to stand up and tell everyone why we deserved to live. We were then told that there was a lifeboat with only two seats and we had to choose who was going to live and who was going to die. We were given 6 popsicle sticks and had 17 girls. We each had to go around the room, yelling in each girl’s face either ,”YOU LIVE,” or “YOU DIE”. They had people standing in for our parents and we had to tell the idea of our parents that they deserved to die. I will never ever forget the feeling of being forced to tell the girls that I loved that they deserved to die simply because I only had 6 sticks as life votes. One girl refused to participate and just gave everyone a die vote. She wasn’t able to graduate the program as soon as she should have because she didn’t play the game that they wanted her to play. The whole point was to see if you would pick a stick for yourself. Whoever had the most sticks and kept one for themselves was allowed to “live’ and the rest of us lay on the floor and said goodbye to our parents for the last time as we “died”. I will never forget hearing the sobs of my sisters saying how sorry they were to their parents for being bad kids.I will never forget the feeling of sinking inside myself, I really felt like I was dying. I think about this process every single day and have severe trauma from it. After the process we had to go around and ask people why they gave us a die vote and you had to have some kind of reason for it, like “You aren’t strong enough and I think you’ll go back to drugs so I thought my life vote should go to someone else.” The reasons people gave me for why I deserved to die still ring in my ears and I feel horrible that I then was forced to inflict that same pain on other people.
•	Stretch Weekend: Also included in that weekend of hell was a “stretch” where we had to do something that made us really uncomfortable. I was forced to dance in front of everyone for their entertainment and I couldn’t stop until everyone thought I was being “genuine”. Girls who were seen as attention seeking or entitled were made to be silent and “serve” the staff and students by feeding them grapes and washing their feet. This was incredibly uncomfortable to be used for someone’s entertainement and then have other girls that I loved and cared for be forced to “serve” me. It was classic brainwashing with a really difficult process to break you down, and then being forced to do things you would never normally do and then reward your behavior with this “servitude”. We were then held by the other girls and literally lifted up and they played a song and talked about how much stronger we were now and we were made to believe that this whole weekend was a good, powerful thing, which I believed for a long time. 
•	Stretch Weekend: After I went through this whole thing, I was then supposed to be one of the “staff” at the next one we did about six months later. I still have flashbacks and anxiety related to the fact that I was forced to inflict this on other girls. I had to walk them around the room and shout, “YOU DIE”, in everyone’s face, I had to enforce the rules and call girls by their derogatory nicknames, I had to tell staff if someone wasn’t participating, which would cause them to be punished and possibly kept there longer. At the end of the weekend, we were told never to tell anyone. I didn’t realize how concerning that was until after I left. Their rationale was that one day someone might go through the process and they didn’t want us to “ruin their experience” for them.
•	Towel Process: Another process that seriously affected me was the towel process. In the towel process, we were given a duct taped towel and we were all put in seperate corners of the house. Mickey had a microphone and walked us therough this whole thing where we relived the worst moments of our lives. Then, we were told to bang the towel on the ground and scream and cry and “let it out”. The sounds of every other girl in that house reliving their worst, scariest times was horrifying. I was so scared, especially as someone with anxiety, this was incredibly traumatizing. If you didn’t participate or didn’t scream and cry, it would come back to you later in the form of feedback as you “not working your program”. The sound of screaming, even if it is out of joy brings me back to this process.
•	Surrender Process: Another process that severely affected my mental health was the surrender process. This was when Mickey would take us to a dimly lit room and have us all sit alone and then tell us to put our palms up, then palms down, then palms together, then palms down over, and over, and over, and over again until she told us to stop. By the time we stopped it had been about 2 and a half hours. If you didn’t participate, it would get brought up later and potentially keep you there later. It was a testiment to how dedicated you were if you would do the entire thing. I found this process to be really creepy and manipulative. It forced us to surrender to the program out of duress and fear. It makes me nervous now when I am asked to do repetative things.
•	Gradutation Process: This process was probably one of the more messed up ones and still gets to me when I think about it. There were multiple parts and this process was done only when you were about to graduate. The purpose of the process was to see if they could break you, to see how dedicated you were to the program. There was always the fear that if you didn’t do what they said or didn’t participate fully that they wouldn’t let you go home. 
o	We were not allowed to speak to anyone for the entire day.
o	All day Mickey berated us. She called me stupid, dumb, and an idiot for things like tying my shoes too slowly. SHe verbally abused us all day and would make us do ridiculous chores and then mess it up and make us do it again. A lot of the time, the other girls would be watching and laughing.
o	We were forced to roll giant logs across campus and stack them. This really hurt my back but we weren’t allowed to speak so I couldn’t tell anyone.
o	We had to march everywhere in a line and had to ask permission to enter and leave rooms. 
o	We were blindfolded and forced to run around in the woods following Mickey’s claps. The two girls I was doing it with and me got scraped up by the trees. They would let us just run face first into things. I still haven’t figured out the purpose of this process.
o	We were forced to write down the names of the five people that mattered most to us and then told to burn them one at a time, all while Mickey is yelling about how you will never have anyone but yourself. The last card I had had my mom’s name on it, and they made me burn it and let it go. This part really messed up my relationship with my parents because they really enforced that I could never rely on anyone but myself. I still struggle with relationships to this day. 
o	Again, at the end of the process, we were told never to tell anyone because they might go through something similar.
o	My insurance was charged $400 for this as a “professional service” from Mickey Manning
o	On Rope: When a girl either was found to have run plans, tried to run away, cut or thought about cutting, attempted or thought about attempting suicide, they were tied to one end of a dog leash and another girl or staff would have to hold it. The leash would be attached to a belt loop on your pants and you weren’t allowed to touch it. It was one of the most dehumanizing things I have ever seen. One time girls had to go out in public on rope, which was incredibly embarrasing and I don’t know how no one called CPS about that. For girls that were on leash, you had to do one of a few things to get on. Threatening suicide, making an attempting, having run plans, actually running, and sometimes self harm were all reasons for getting on leash. The way to get off was basically just when Mickey decided that you could be trusted not to do the thing that you were in trouble for. Girls might be on for a few days or a week, but one time, two girls were put on leash with each other because they didn’t get along and had to stay like that for a month, including going out in public. I only saw it used for that reason that one time.
Treatment
o	No Confidentiality: My private conversations in therapy were constantly brought up in “vote-ups”, in conversations with parents, and in upper-level meetings. In meetings with upper-levels, I was constantly told the confidential information of other girls in therapy like what they were struggling with, the bad things they did, what was happening with their family therapy, and what we needed to “call them out for”.
o	Lack of Treatment for Anorexia Nervosa: I was sent to Clearview to partially deal with my anorexia nervosa that I had had for a couple of years before I went there. When I got into the program, I was very new to eating again and was only 105lbs. I saw a girl getting released from the program who would not sit down, only ate fruits and vegetables, and was probably 100lbs and 5’9. It was clear to me that she still had anorexia and was being sent home anyways. I saw this as an indication that this program had no idea how to treat eating disorders. I told Kim Sparks and Mike Linderman multiple times that I felt that I did not belong there and that it was not an appropriate setting for my eating disorder. I was not allowed to tell my parents that or communicate with anyone that I felt unsafe. My first few months there, I ate as little as possible and was going fully back into my eating disorder. One of the other girls there who had anorexia began to help me through it and I was put “on-hip” with her. Eventually, I realized that the program wouldn’t help me and I would have to treat myself on my own, or risk losing all of the progress i had made. I had to ask Clinical for permission to create a meal plan for myself and I kept track in my journal of what I ate and didn’t eat. No one ever check in with the meal plan and made sure I was eating. Only my weight was checked. My eating disorder was rarely discussed in therapy and I stil struggle with it to this day.
o	Lack of Treatment for Eating Disorders: After I began successfully treating myself, other girls began to come to me for hteir eating disorder. I helped another girl with bulimia create a meal plan for herself and would check in with her often to see how it was going. If there was a girl who was thought to have an eating disorder, staff and students would ask me to go and check in with her and see what was going on. I was 15, this was not my job, but I was forced to provide health services that I was not qualified for because I was worried if I didn’t, no one would and they would get very sick.
o	Forced Excercise and Manual Labor: Any expert on eating disorders understands that excessive exercise is commonly a symptom of an eating disorder and can be incredibly dangerous. Every morning, all girls were forced to work out either to a work out DVD or one of the girls would lead the session. Everything about working out was focused on burning calories and losing weight which was incredibly harmful to my recovery. I constantly thought about how much weight I was gaining there and counted calories and then tried to burn them in the work outs. If the program actually did understand how to treat eating disorders, they would understand that. All of our punishments were physical labor or exercise, often to the point of dangerous excess. 
	We used to have to take walks to prepare for Bloomsday which is a seven mile marathon. We were forced to take seven mile walks with a staff memeber driving a bus really close behind us. If we weren’t going fast enough for the staff, they would speed up and almost hit us and we would have to run to get away from it. I was almost hit multiple times and the feeling of having to run away from a car is really bizzare and made me feel unsafe. If a girl had tripped and fallen, they would have gotten run over.
	Sometimes we were forced to clean staff’s houses or cars as a way to complete hours or to “volunteer”. I had to go to a staff’s mom’s house and clean it and it had many dead, rotting, animal hides inside. The smell was ridiculous and kids should not have been handling that material. The staff would watch us from the windows and yell at us to mow the lawn faster or wash the windows better. We got yelled at not to break things but they made us clean them for them anyways. At Mickey’s house, we were forced to chop and stack wood for her, clean her oven, rake her yard, and other chores. This was presented to us as a privilege and again, if you didn’t participate you would get a write up and it would keep you there longer. 
o	Inappropriate Duties Given to Students: As you leveled up in the program, you were asked to take on responsibilites as a type of staff assistant. Some of these were incredibly inappropriate and never should have happened. We had a girl with severe fetal alcohol syndrome, it was so bad she didn’t know how to bathe herself or brush her teeth even though she was 15. I, along with a few other girls, were given the responsiblity of teaching her how to shower and we would have to watch her, naked, and tell her how to wash her hair and make sure she put soap on all of her body. We had to brush our teeth with her and sing songs with her to make sure she brushed long enough. We had to make sure she put on the right clothes in the right order. I can’t imagine how humiliating this was for her, and it was incredibly uncomfortable for me. It was like parenting a toddler who shouldn’t have been there in the first place. We also had the power to give other girls write-ups which was commonly abused by upper levels and could severely impact whoever they gave write ups to. It could take girls from 20 hills and 4 hours, to 50 hills and 10 hours in a week. We were told to police each other and “Hold a Standard” and make sure that no one broke the rules and if they did, you had to tell on them or risk getting in trouble for knowing and not telling. This distrust between the girls created a toxic environment of one-upping and trying to get people back.
•	Education was practically non existent unless you were “trusted enough” to go to the local public school.
•	Kim the therapist being homophobic/treatment of LGBTQ
•	Unqualified staff: there was literally no training for staff. They would sometimes fall asleep on the job, be mean to girls, and in some cases physically abuse girls. Chris was one of the house moms who was really terrible to girls with fetal alcohol syndrome and would get physical with them. She also seemed to have it out for Julie and after Julie left, another girl told me that she became the subject of Chris’ abuse. 
•	Strip searches were done when you first got there and to check and see if you had cut. It was incredibly uncomfortable and I did not want to be seen naked by staff. 

Here are some of the things Clearview and Mickey told my mom and family that weren’t true.
•	Daily therapy 4 days a week with Kim - group therapy not included
o	I got therapy once every one to two weeks and towards the end of my stay it was about once every three weeks.
•	Mickey would be there when Mike and Kim weren’t there.
o	This wasn’t true at all, Mickey was almost only there when Mike and Kim were.
•	They would treat my ED and that others would be treated and that I would never be paired with another girl with ED
o	They did not treat my ED and immediately paired me with another girl who had one.
•	Were told I would not be forced to exercise due to that being negative for an eating disorder.
o	I was forced to exercise every morning, go on crazy seven mile walks, and do hills even when I probably shouldn’t have medically been doing them.
o	Got light headed doing hills and blacked out, they gave me a piece of wheat bread and said go finish your hills
•	I was told that our parents signed their parental rights over to the program when that wasn’t true. 
•	Parents weren’t told that I would be seen by someone who didn’t have a degree yet. My mom was told that I would be seen by a credentialed therapist.
•	Parents were not allowed to see me until workshop, they kept pushing it off and coming up with excuses for my parents not to see me. 
•	My mom was afraid to bring up concerns about the program (Mickey) because she was worried Mickey would retaliate and do something to me.
•	

I talked a little bit about how this affected me in the statements above but I am going to sum it up here. I am now incredibly wary of authority and I have a really hard time asking for help, especially mental health help. I have serious trauma from the processes and graduation processes. I still hear the things Mickey told me ringing in my ears. I still hear the voices of staff telling me that I am wrong or I am lying. It took me years to rebuild my relationship with my parents and to build it on something more than lies and brainwashing. I am so scared, constantly, all the time. I have nightmares about Clearview or programs constantly. I have needed serious counseling and therapy because of what happened at Clearview. I am working on getting to see someone who specializes in trauma from an extended period of time. I have been told my counselors that I have PTSD and it is evident from my behavior as well. I still have panic attacks if something reminds me of Clearview. I use eating disorder behaviors when I get too focused on remembering what happened there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/c85od7/abuse_of_children_in_behavioral_modification_cults/,6,Damn that sounds so horrible.

I've had an idea for a while now to create a group dedicated to lowering the voting age in Canada to 16, and with the Albertan election being called for next month and the Federal Election happening this fall I think that now's the best time to start it. I'm calling for anyone on this subreddit who also wants to see our voting age lowered, whether that be Provincially, Federally, or anywhere else, to please PM me and/or subscribe to r/YouthVoteCanada, so that we can hopefully try and make lowering the voting age an election issue both for this election and in general Canadian politics.

This is probably a bad idea, and I have no clue how many people actually would go ahead with it, but by doing this we can at least see where we stand and decide what the best option is moving forwards for lowering the voting age in Canada.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/b57g2o/looking_for_canadians_passionate_about_lowering/,6,,2019-03-25 07:11:46

534,7zsiaq,False,None,7,Am I being discriminated against?,YouthRights,"There is this policy in my school (Which is in Iowa) that bans international students from dating. This is very odd. In our Host Family Agreement, (which international students make with the school and the host family) it says:"" there is no dating"". It is said by our international student program coordinators that the actions of breaking the rules can end up in expulsion from the school. 
  There are a few problems with this policy: 1.The American students are not subject to this rule (They are able to date). The international students are distinguished although we are enrolled in the same school. (We don't have the same right) 

  To offer you opinions from my school. Here is one of the coordinators' responses to the dating policy for international students:  
  In answer to your questions, we have several policies specialized to International Students and living with Host Families.  You can check it out here:
  The students, their families, and the host families sign this before the year begins and all of our students knew this was a Christian school with policies in place and they did agree to attend with these requirements.  All people have “rights” but as Christians, we believe that “all things are permissible, but not all things are beneficial”.  We have looked at the policies of other private schools in the US also as we considered our Host Family Agreement.
  Our policies have been in place for five years and we feel they are there for the good of all the students and host families.  Just like any educational institution, there are cases in which students have pushed the issue and had consequences if the actions were not following this Agreement.

  The dating policy was based on the belief that you would only date someone you believe you would marry someday.   Students who do date at PCHS are under the guidance of loving parents.  This puts an enormous burden on the host family to be responsible for the dating life of a young person because it could involve this person’s future and yet another student’s life- the person they choose to date.  We suggest that if an international student cares more deeply for another student it would be wise to get to know them in a group setting as a friend.  After high school, if those feelings are still present and mutual, dating could be considered.

  I believe that serious dating is difficult at the high school level because many students are not yet socially, emotionally and spiritually mature.  Also, many of our international students do not profess to be Christians and that makes for concerns from our beliefs.   (2 Cor 6:14)  Marriage is difficult already and now add different cultures, teenagers who may not even know who they are or teenagers who are not responsible for themselves (let alone responsible for another person and possibly a child)  We want to honor God most of all with our marriages and that takes two committed people that are like-minded in the big issues of life.  It is God’s love that unites and sustains two people for years of faithfulness.  

  We allow our students to experience the cultural art of a date by attending the Christmas Banquet or Junior Senior Banquet with a date.  

  These are my viewpoints along with our policy and you may want to check with the other members of the ISP Team to see if they have other items to add

He claims that teenagers are capable and should be given responsibilities the moment they're ready. Globally, teens in preindustrial countries are already integrated into responsible, adult society, and teen problems as we know them do not exist. Only in Western industrialized countries are teens isolated from adults through education and laws. American teens are overly dependent on drugs and alcohol, obsessed with their appearance, careless about sex, and moody/depressed/angry. This large volume covers it all, especially the positives: what kids can do, what decisions they should be making. For example, in the field of education, Epstein advocates shorter compulsory school hours, mandatory education for basics only, more individualized instruction, and an end to age segregation. Epstein's credentials and research are extensive; his arguments, persuasive. He is an astute observer of the world around him, especially its do-nothing adolescents.

if you can be tried as an adult,why don't you have the same rights as an adult? It's ESPECIALLY hypocritical because of ""underage"" drinking,sex,etc laws,school laws,etc
 UPDATE:I was thinking of how an everyday person would respond to this. They'd probably say something like, ""Young people are more likely to ruin their lives(when drinking, having sex, or dropping out), than to make good choices with those freedoms,"" or something like, ""Not killing is easier to mentally process than properly drinking, fucking, or working.""
Or they'd mention the lack of a frontal lobe guaranteeing recklessness or something. But, if our brains were supposed to primarily do bad, then wouldn't we be described as just not knowing better (like younger kids), thus shouldn't be tried as adults?

So they know that reckless brain shit is false and we are capable of being responsible with freedom/ deciding to or not to wreck havoc with our lives and others, but are we not allowed to express that responsibility along with having the consequences of raping, murdering, etc?

Why the heck are the laws so inconsistent? We are adults who know not to harm others and can be jailed for doing so, but are also just children who can't possibly know how to drink (or do anything considered dangerous) safely?

We can mentally process not bringing danger to others, but apparently we can't process how to not danger ourselves?

""President Obama, in the wake of the massacre of 26 children and adults in Newtown, Connecticut’s, Sandy Hook Elementary School last Friday, says “we are not doing enough to protect our children.”

How can we possibly “do enough” when the president, interests, and media commentators won’t even talk about what the real dangers to our kids are?

Here’s a scary fact neither the president nor other commentators will contemplate, because it’s just too unpalatable:

A large majority of murdered American children under age 10 are murdered in violence by their parents.

Not by mass shootings by deranged white gunmen in schools or theaters, not by dark-skinned gangbangers on urban streets, not by bullies or lurking internet predators. A child or teenager under age 18 is 40 times more likely to be murdered at home by their parent or caretaker than at school by a peer (as at Columbine) or outside (as at Sandy Hook) killer.

Put precisely--and this is a critical distinction--what the president and virtually all other commentators are saying **is not that we need to protect our children from being murdered for their sakes, but that we need to protect our parents from suffering a child being murdered by someone else.**

Think about how different our discussion of “protecting our children” would be if Obama demanded attention to all tragically slain children.

...

We don't need a narrow discussion that fixates only on ""school shootings"" and ""young people"" and ""our children."" We need to broaden the debate to all murderous violence, everywhere.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1dtpu7/the_children_as_property_aspect_of_the_gun_debate/,6,[deleted] ,2013-05-06 23:20:02

Of course this doesn't apply to everyone, (for example my English teacher is very supportive of his students' opinions and statements) but it does apply to many others, it's as if we're not allowed to have the right to be treated as humans? Feel free to go through it yourself, but last time I checked, the convention of children's rights says specifically that all children have the right to an opinion and for it to be taken seriously, but how often is that respected? I understand that some of the kids actually are the stereotypical mindless children that we're portrayed as, but shouldn't most adults be smart enough not to jump to conclusions and make assumptions towards every kid out there?

618,7z9ggt,False,None,0,Letter to the Youth of the Nation and World,YouthRights,"**Addressed to all it may concern, of the youth of the United States, and of the world,**

We must now change the way we run the government, of not just this nation, but all the nations and states of all this planet. Our skills and talents, that may be put forth in the halls of government, in the embassies and envoys of diplomacy, and in the skyscrapers of business, as youth, are being squandered on this Earth. We cannot use these talents the better the world as we should, instead we are regulated to backwash.
 
Schooled, no matter if we need it or not, and never in the way of our personal choice. We are not given a voice to choose leaders that might change the legislation to keep us safe from harm in these schools. We don't even get to choose the members of the municipal, county, and state school boards, that, with a single vote, could significantly alter our daily lives. 

We are denied freedom to travel alone, we are denied the freedom to congregate without supervision, or past certain times of the day. And we are denied the right to vote for our leaders or hold the offices ourselves. For surely, the adults say, 'only mature adults may hold these high offices of power and prestige, for youth could not handle the pressure', which they say for their own hubris's sake indeed. For we have at our even highest office, in this nation, a feckless, egotistical, and power-hungry leader, that if we replaced with a three-year old, we would note a great improvement. 

And is this their grand example, is this who they put forth as a person worthy to lead what, arguably, is the most powerful nation conceived on the face of this planet? For if that is indeed the case, I could present ten, nor, twenty, so called 'minors', not even past the age of eighteen, some not even past the age of sixteen, that would be a more effective, righteous, and worthy leader of the nation as a whole. 

And they say, 'surely only adults to vote, because children are too incompetent to do so', which again I say, they proclaim for their own heightened hubris and pride. For if you do not allow all those under the age of eighteen not to vote, just because some of them are undereducated or incompetent, neither should all of those over the age of eighteen, for indeed, many so called 'adults' that are over the age of eighteen, of voting age that is, are too unintelligent and lack the knowledge that a voter should truly pertain. 

Therefore, my friends, my brethren, we must take a stand. We must rise to take what is properly ours. Or else, fall into the pits of oppression and of helplessness. We must not fear this change, we must not fear the speech, the protest, and the petitions that we shall send forth to win our freedom justly and fairly. For it has been said by many, that fear has two meanings. F.E.A.R., Fear Everything And Run, or Face Everything And Rise. The choice is yours to make, make it wisely. 

**Yours in the Cause of Brother and Sisterhood,**

620,687l2c,False,None,4,Instagram Spam Accounts and School Suspensions,YouthRights,"Good evening members of /r/YouthRights I have come here today to discuss rights that a student has in school. Recently, my school has been suspending people because of the use of *Finsta* Instagram accounts. These are also called spam accounts for all the posts you want only closer friends to see for instance. We also have a “strict” no cell phone policy that says teachers can give us permission to use them for educational purposes. In short, they have been using the “this is causing a reasonable disruption in school” excuse for EVERY spam account they seem to find. I know for a fact one of the assistant principals is on Instagram actively, even during the school day, and has pulled kids out of class for posts during school hours. What I am here to discuss is mainly that Tinker v. Des Moines was decided in 1969, way before computers and the internet was invented. I can see this being an issue if someone was being bullied because that is an obvious disruption but in my opinion it should be on a case by case basis not targeting “spam” accounts themselves. The internet and technology is evolving constantly and the school systems are using court rulings from years ago. Tinker was physical arm bands protesting the Vietnam war, a peaceful protest at that. How could that even remotely be applied to an online account that a student owns. What gives a school a right to actively look at online accounts, that are private, and threaten to suspend them regardless of content. I believe they would at least need reasonable suspicion for that certain person.  Student owned device, student paid internet access, student owned Instagram account. There really needs to be an outline on the federal level or something saying what rights a students has on the internet in a school setting.

Most of the people were there to avoid having to go to a Freshmen only class. The others checked it out a couple of times then never came back. Basically, people were apathetic to the point where nothing could be done. The only victory ""we"" had was a one-on-one meeting I had with the head principal about education policy, after I posted an open letter on my blog. This year I'm going to push, and participate, in more open, publicized, and even radical directions, since that is all that has worked so far. 

I've been in contact with some other education reform activist, mostly Houman Harouni as of late. He was suggesting that finding the right people, and pushing hard on them, would be better than just sending out general calls. 

I was hoping others here who faced similar situations would be willing to share advice on spreading the word and finding other youth rights activists. How can I push for more action, and find more activists?

Also, what are some good resources on activism tactics? When I'm by myself, I know pretty well what to do, but have some difficulty explaining my reasoning to others.

I have no way of getting a hold of Ellie, she's not allowed to make phone calls, send e-mails, check facebook, nothing. These two monsters abandoned their daughter because they believed that she needed to be saved.

655,pmj37,False,None,16,Question: how far does this go?,YouthRights,"So, I've always firmly believed that children and youth are a lot smarter than most adults I encounter think, and their thoughts and opinions far more valid than is generally accepted. But, obviously, there are limits. You can be really smart, and think things through well, but still lack the life experience to make good choices, and while I believe strongly in everyone's right to fail miserably, shouldn't we have some obligation to protect the too young from failing too much? And when, then, does too young end?

Where and how is the line drawn? If age based things are unreasonable because some youth are capable, how do we determine who is and isn't capable, and is someone who is incapable at 17 any more capable at 21? A test? How do you test for general life competence, and how do you prevent it from being subjective and discriminatory? 

I hope no one takes this wrong, I'm genuinely curious as to how you think this works out, I think the current way youth and children are thought of is more like incompetent property than less experienced humans with equal rights, but I don't know how that could be fixed, or even if it can be fixed without more problems.

681,avi23d,False,None,0,The Horrors of My High School,YouthRights,"Edit: I was sent this by a close friend. I wanted to share the awareness to help him and the Youth.

Update: My friend here got expelled from the school for the last suspension.  The youth in this country is fucked. This country is fucked.

This was the best subreddit I could find with a large audience base for this topic. I just want to spread awareness to the horrors that go on in schools of the good ol' USA. So here goes nothing

So my story begins with my freshman year. I get into high school and all is going well. I only have one person that bothers me at this point and its annoying but one person I can brush off. Well I was doing just that, minding [my own business](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/avht7s/the_horrors_of_high_school/#). Well this person in particular decided one day to take my phone and because I thought I had a tough lock screen password, I was wrong, he got into my phone and decided to show some of my nudes around to a few students in an attempt to say ""look, this kid is innocent. Don't trust him, he is a perv."" So I tried to get my phone back once I realized what he was doing because I was at that moment paying attention to my school work and not my phone because I wanted to get my work done (for once). Well one of the people that was unlucky enough to see my unbearable manhood, decided to report this incident to the office. Now I don't blame them, they were trying to report the person that took my phone because they were harassing me, they even told me this so I didn't hate them (you'll see why I might now). Well I get called down to the office and they ask me about these pictures and all. I'm not thinking that anything is going to happen to me at the moment because I didn't do anything. But after a few questions of the [incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/avht7s/the_horrors_of_high_school/#), the school SUSPENDED ME. the ""victim"" of this situation. Now i'm not one to pull the victim card because I hate that bs, but this time I was a tad angry. So I served a 3-day suspension and it went on my school record because someone that was harassing me, decided to get into my phone and wanted to make me look bad to everyone because they are a sad little soul. The individual that took my phone also faced 0 punishment for harassing me and taking my phone without my permission.

So there wasn't much I could do in that situation because they found a legal loophole in the handbook stating that I had child pornography in the school. EVEN though it was in my LOCKED phone. (and yes it was my nudes and 2 other peoples I had dated before). Well this was my first ever situation and it brought a shun upon me and I was pushed into the ""bad kid"" label.

But now i am currently a sophomore in this high school. My grades have been at there lowest point because through other events in my life, I have just been in a state of mind I never would wish upon my worst enemy. Well the 2nd incident that has just happened (currently still suspended) has not helped with this and now I am even more shunned and the school officials and the students have started to take a disliking in me because I keep being reported and suspended for dumb shit. But my 2nd story is a little longer so grab a drink and sit back and witness the destruction of my high school career because of sensitive snowflakes.

I have to start with this by stating that I and my friends are known to be the edgy group and really out there with shit (I just don't get offended or hurt over vulgar jokes or content). And I understand that the school has guidelines and not everyone can find either humor or ""shock value"" in things that are really out there. With that said, this is why I have become part of certain groups and friends with certain people for the edgy talks and edgy jokes, so this way I don't have to offend anyone because it is within our group and our standards to not care about certain shit because we have all agreed it does not bother us.

Well even though that is the case, our humor outreached to certain individuals (maybe because my 2 friends in this situation were being loud and obnoxious about their edgy jokes that honestly in this case were in poor taste and I only laughed at the remarks because It was so cringey.

Before I get ahead of myself, the remarks in this situation were made toward a teacher that so happened to be in line of view at that moment (also just happened to be female which didn't help in 2019). My friend T started to make jokes about ripping and maiming this individual teacher and raping her and then climbing into her dead remains. I'm summarizing but they went into gruesome detail for shock value. Then my friend J chimed in for the cringe. Again the way they did it and dragged on for 5 minutes, the only laughter came from the cringey aspect of the ""jokes."" I will also add that we do not hate females, we fully support equality between all walks of life, we are just edgy 16 year olds and find ways to joke for shock value, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I will also say that we have said these types of things about males and females in the school (mainly to the annoying people) but i've remarked about ripping a dudes spine out with a sickle and he heard me and did not care, he actually chimed in on the joke saying that he would rip out both of my testicles if he had a sickle and proceeded to laugh and we moved on, its what civil people do. And I understand in 2019 that things have to be taken seriously and my friends know that and understood why they were suspended, keyword is ""they.""

Well this remark about this teacher was reported to the office and both my friend T and J were suspended and they really do not care. For now, i'll explain at the end. They were questioned and because the remarks were made at our lunch table and there is a camera right above us, they confirmed with the gestures they were making. No one tried to sugar coat things or lie because it just didn't matter to them.

(keep in mind that this was a joke that was brought up right then and there for the shock value, it was not a planned thing or an actual attempt to do anything to anyone because we just don't have the [stomach](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/avht7s/the_horrors_of_high_school/#) or heart to hurt anyone in a gruesome way like that. Keyword of this story is ""Shock Value"" because what you find offensive may not be to another.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/avi23d/the_horrors_of_my_high_school/,4,,2019-02-27 20:33:09

Reddit’s Model House of Commons (a parliament simulation) has just begun voting in it’s 5th General Election and it’s open to anyone interested in voting (which is easy, fairly anonymous, and fast).

I’m asking for your vote for the Green Party because we have stood tirelessly for fair and equal elections, social justice, LGBT rights, environmentalism, economic policies focused on helping the average individual, and an intelligent foreign policy. The Green Party has elected 2 past Prime Ministers and has a strong and active showing on the Model House of Commons.

I hope you take a brief moment of your time to help our subreddit continue to function, since we run off of the votes of the public. While it is just a simulation, this of course is very real and very enjoyable for all of us, and your time is a huge help. Every vote matters!

Please come and vote GREEN here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/46xtgq/general_election_v_megathread/

716,18v76v,False,None,0,I do not believe that age is a reason to respect someone.,YouthRights,"All over the Internet, I see adults complaining about how children are being disrespectful to an adult, which is wrong due to their age. I personally have a few things to say about this:

1. Children today are no more disrespectful than they were in your time. Your generation talked back to teachers, your generation sneaked out if the house, and your generation threw a fit over not getting that toy you wanted. In fact, correct me if Im wrong, but Socrates wrote about how stupid and disrespectful children were.

2. Age < Who you are an what you've done. As a 15 year old, I automatically have an equal amount of respect for everyone. However, when someone displays an act of stupidity or irrationality, I lose the respect. I have a real word example that causes me to say this. My school has this new class called STEM, which is basically a computer class. Well, the problem is that the teacher doesn't know anything about the subject. All she does is find assignments off the Internet, and makes us do them while not really checking for accuracy. After you're done, you have to list your sources as to where you found your information on the Internet. Clever, preventing people from just writing stuff down but, ehh...

*I already know where power comes from *

So, needless to say, I have no respect for her because of what she's done. Which this isn't all of it. She loses our assignments, too.



Tl;dr: Stop respecting people for their age alone, and respect them for what they do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/18v76v/i_do_not_believe_that_age_is_a_reason_to_respect/,4,,2013-02-20 04:11:00

The World Humanitarian Forum to be held in London from April 15-16, 2020 is a high-profile, two-day event that brings together prominent leaders from the public and private sectors, as well as international thought leaders and pioneers from global aid and international development communities to learn, network, supply and source. It is expected to attract more than 3000 global public and private sector officials from over 50 countries.

The World Humanitarian Forum 2020 will focus on ""Shaping the Future for a Better Tomorrow"" with a special focus on youth (human capital), refugees, sustainable development, new funding models and climate change. Our aim is to change the narrative – from aid to investment; from hope to possibility.

During the 15th and 16th April 2020, the World Humanitarian Forum's Agenda for Action and Change will feature young AFI Changemakers as an integral part of high-level keynote speeches with world-renowned humanitarian activists and thought leaders, and a range of panel discussions and fireside chats.

 
Benefits of attending the AFI Change-makers Summit at the World Humanitarian Forum include:

1. All participants are eligible for the Change-makers Awards. 
2. The winner of the Change-makers Awards wins a paid internship for three months with one of the partner companies.
3. AFI Change-makers get a platform to network with global leaders and activists and partake in the sessions as speakers.
4. They get a chance to feature their thoughts and have their voices permanently recorded via the AFI Global Change-makers Report that will be published by the Ariel Foundation International.
 
Please note that the application fee is 75 Euros and last day to apply is March 10, 2020. The application process is competitive and the decision will be announced on a rolling basis.

We assist them in finishing school, getting a credential, and helping to place them in a long term career type job (through tuition assistance, paid internships, and supportive financial services for books, supplies, gas cards or bus passes, etc.) We’re struggling with street outreach though. Obviously most people aren’t going to open up to a stranger about their criminal background after talking to them for 30 seconds, but we really need to get more youth in our program. 

Does anyone have tips and strategies to help approach and talk to this population?

If they do, you could see if they’d be willing to point students who have just graduated in the direction of your organization. ",2019-08-14 18:36:38

779,7p02ys,False,None,3,"France banned child beauty pageants because they ""hypersexualize girls from a young age."" Should we ban Mall Santas because they deceive children and perpetuate a culture wherein children are seen as gullible and incompetent?",YouthRights,"Everybody was okay with France's decision to ban beauty pageants for children. Why wouldn't we be okay with banning Mall Santas?

Children believe in Santa Claus not because they're too stupid to realize that a fat bearded old man couldn't possibly go through their chimney and leave presents under a tree. No. Children believe in Santa Claus because *we, the adults, told them so.* And children trust us. Why wouldn't they? We give them food, shelter, baths, clothing, gifts, care, love... Why would they have the slightest reason to believe we are lying to them?

Yet, despite our obsession with having honest people in power, it is the cultural norm to lie to children about a whole lot of things. Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, the stork... Sometimes things that weren't supposed to be believed in as true enter the mix: Cartoons, movies, books... I've seen some people on reddit fake a Hogwarts letter for their children when they become 11, as happens in the Harry Potter books. I believed cartoon characters actually existed when I was a kid, and was confused why wouldn't they ever visit us. Again, nobody told me the truth.

Telling the truth to children is seen as a gross, even immoral act. People who do so are seen as the bad people in the story, and the liars are praised as ""defenders of childhood."" I guess some who hear my opinion on this would have thought ""Okay, I wouldn't lie to my kid about Santa, but I would not tell them about sex and reproduction. They are not ready for it! They will be too scared!"" Well, weren't YOU scared when the Snowden NSA leaks happened? Would you prefer to never have learned about it? Of course not, *because being scared is part of being informed of unpleasant truths.* ""Oh, but let they grow up a little before we tell them! Don't tell them while they're too young!"" They start asking ""where do babies come from?"" from a very young age. If you have a ""full honesty"" policy when it comes to adults, why wouldn't you have one for children? Yes, they might cry, but so do many children at any age when it comes to these certain unpleasant truths about life. Heck, some *adults* aren't informed about some of them. Weren't you scared when you learned that the Sun is going to become a Red Giant and swallow the Earth one day? Doesn't it give you an existential crisis to think that we may not live forever? One way or the other, there will (or not) be some kind of suffering when we realize the truth. It's part of philosophy.

Perpetuating a culture of lying to children is part of the ""extension of childhood"" that many Youth Rights writers talk about. (I'm thinking of Robert Epstein and John Taylor Gatto.) It makes society see children as too incompetent or incapable of reason to have rights and responsibilities, and thus we don't give them such rights and responsibilities. This manifests itself in many things:

1) Authoritarian parenting -- a style of parenting wherein the parent believes that the child's desires, thoughts, ideas, and wishes don't matter because they, the parents, are superior to them, and that therefore it's better for the (allegedly) superior adult to make the decisions instead of the (allegedly) inferior child, even when these decisions can perfectly be done by the child. (Subverted by authoritative and peaceful parenting styles, including Taking Children Seriously, where force is avoided in the decisions affecting the child.)

2) Traditional, compulsory schooling -- the legally-enforced style of education wherein the students should be submissive to their adults superiors, and don't have any decisive power over their own education. (Subverted by self-directed education, where the responsibility over their own education is returned to the children, either in a democratic schools such as Sudbury Valley School wherein they have the same decision power as the adult members of the school, or in unschooling, a kind of homeschooling wherein the parents allow their children to pursue their own interests, at their own time, at their own pace. (Shoutout to /r/unschool, where both are discussed, and where I wrote many articles similar to this one. Shoutout also to [the Alliance for Self-Directed Education](https://www.self-directed.org/), a non-profit organization recently launched for advocating for this. One of its founding members, Dr. Peter Gray, also writes regularly about the subject.)

3) Legal discrimination -- If you're in this subreddit, you're likely to be aware of it. Children can't drive and can't vote, no matter how smart or skillful they are, because of the belief that they're too incompetent for this. Robert Epstein writes that a child has twice as many restrictions as a convicted felon. (You can elaborate more on this in the comments, I don't feel very comfortable writing about drugs and sex, for example. That would be too progressive for people outside the community to accept.)

4) Overall prejudice against children in society -- Ever heard people say, ""Stop being so childish""? What about ""This is so bad, it looks like a 5-year-old did it""? I'm sorry, but children can be as competent as adults, no matter what age, as long as they work on it. A 12-year-old with 5 years experience is still more experienced than a 35-year-old with 3 years experience. **Age does not cause experience. Experience causes experience.**

That's it. So, what do you think? Should we ban Mall Santas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/7p02ys/france_banned_child_beauty_pageants_because_they/,2,"Ok, teenagers aren't children, they are young adults. I agree, there is nothing wrong with telling a child the truth about: sexual reproduction, Santa Claus, and so on. Then they are informed. 
But as for teenagers, THEY ARE NOT CHILDREN! They are really suffering here. And one more thing: Every child is different.
They deserve the truth. And yes Peter Gray is good too. I'll cover drugs and sex for you: (this is about teenagers) 
When you start puberty, that’s when you are an adult. Teens are post pubescent, that means they have finished puberty, and are sexually mature. We are prolonging childhood. We pretend that our teens are still kids. Once a mammal reaches puberty, they aren’t a child. But we still love to lie to our teens and call them kids, when we know that deep down, they aren’t kids, they are young adults. With goats, a kid is prepubescent and adults post pubescent. No middle stage. Because there isn’t one, the adolescent is a 20th century myth, it dates back to 1902, created by the school system at the beginning of the industrial revolution. This is ageism. Read Robert Epstein's Teen 2.0, he explains this better than I can. They are adults. And don’t give me that teen brain shit, there is no evidence of there being anything wrong with the teenage brain. This is all big pharma. Give young people full adult rights, this is discrimination. Robert Epstein explains this. LIVE AND LET LIVE. ",2018-01-08 17:30:08

824,6q1oym,False,None,10,My dad is an ageist and is infringing on my rights. He won't let me play football. Is ther anything I can do?,YouthRights,"The jizz of the question is in my title.  I'm a 16 year old high school student and my dad won't let me play football. 

Some background: I'm on the bigger side so I know I would excel at football.  I can benchpress more than most guys my age and can be very aggressive although most of the time I'm very nice.  I get good grades (As and Bs), so that's not a problem.

My dad is an emergency room doctor.  When I brought up wanting to play football he said absolutely not.  When I asked why he said he sees a lot of guys my age coming in with concussions and some come more than once.  Then he went onto lecture me for over ten minutes about why concussions are bad and the long term effects.

I told him I didn't care because I can probably become a professional player.  If not, my grades are good enough to where I can get into a good college and have a good career.  I'd like to become a chemical engineer if football doesn't work out, so its not like I don't have a back-up plan.  

I explained all this to him and he still said no.  My mom isn't any help because she's a pediatrician and agrees with my dad.  

Is there anything I can legally do?  Can I sue my dad or school to let me play?  I've thought about forging his signature but don't want to get in trouble.  

Thanks

It is expected to attract more than 3000 global public and private sector officials from over 50 countries.

Translation provided by /u/paninomatic

""
**Lawsuit filed against rabbi for circumcising kids**
**Because of the circumcision of kids a doctor out of Hesse filed a lawsuit against a rabbi out of Hof. It seems to be the first lawsuit because of a religious circumcision in Bavaria.**

The prosecutor of Hof confirmed to the Bavarian broadcasting service that a doctor filed a lawsuit although the chief public prosecutor of Hof says it is still uncertain if it's going to be investigated. The rabbi learned about the lawsuit through the broadcasting service. He perceives it as ""anti-semitism"".

**Man already conducted 3,000 circumcisions**

On his web page the rabbi points out that circumcision is a Jewish ritual. He reports to already have conducted 3,000 circumcisions on kids and adults. He reports to the broadcasting service though, that the last circumcision in Hof has been done more than a year ago.

**Religious circumcision criticized**

According to information of the broadcasting service the doctor from Hesse is part of a group of about 600 medical professionals and lawyers which wrote an open letter to the federal government in July. In this letter they request to make the debate about religious circumcision more objective.

**Mental and physical damage**

The letter quotes: ""The freedom of religion can not be used as an excuse for the application of sexual force against minor males."" It further states that because of the high risks of lasting genital damage and mental and sexual impairments caused through circumcising babies and small children, the public perception has to be sharpened.

As Wikipedia notes, ""Strictly speaking, the term 'antlion' applies to the larval form of the members of this family, but while several languages have their own terms for the adult, there is no widely used word for them in English."" Yet the phrase persists, when it would be much more natural to consider the larva the normal form and the adult the unusual form.

This mindset is also applied to other insects like the [moth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth) and [crane fly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_fly), where the adult form can be so short-lived as to lack a functional mouth entirely. To consider the crane fly larva a mere transitory phase would be as unusual as referring to human adults as ""unbent senior citizens"". Simpler to refer to the leatherjacket and adult leatherjacket.

I am almost certainly making too much of this, but it reminded me of the sexist tendency in medicine to consider female health the unusual case when most humans are female.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/x7avr/ephebiphobia_in_insect_nomenclature/,0,,2012-07-26 18:30:46

In my opinion, your parents give you chores to help out around the house.  Not because they made you as a cheap maid.  But because your a family and a family should work together,  sometimes they bark at you or yell and that's childish behavior but we are all only human.

The day went well at first. I had to administer a test to an English class: Easy stuff. However, one of the female students was whining that a male student had taken ""her"" seat. There was no assigned seating in this class. I told her it didn't matter, they were just taking a test. She ran out of the classroom to cry in the bathroom. I laughed it off. However, I underestimated the power our society gives to young girls.

I was called two days later, informed that the school district was dropping me. When I asked why, I was told that I had made lewd comments to a student. I protested, and while the school district said that they believed me, they didn't want to get the parents involved and that it'd be simpler to just drop me from a lucrative job permanently.

I want to be a teacher, but now there is this giant stain on my record, all because some teenage girls decided to ruin my career prospects.

932,16yt7q,False,None,11,How many years until we'll be ready for a 12-year-old president?,YouthRights,"I still like to let it sink in from time to time - and on this day it's worth letting sink in again. A black man named Barack Hussein Obama won re-election in a country that once looked down on black people as children at best, subhuman at worst. Get your underage ass in a time machine, go back in time 20 years, and go around saying ""in 20 years we'll be ready to elect a black man named Barack Hussein Obama."" Oh yeah, you also insist that Arab men and women will be voting in elections, and that gay marriage will be a mainstream opinion. And we'll have goddamned robots flying around spying on us and blowing people up.

A grown man walks up to you and asks you just what the hell you are smoking. It just ain't gonna happen in your lifetime kiddo, maybe in 100 years, but no way will it ever happen in 20. Now pass me some of whatever it is that you're smoking. Hey wait, you're underage, smoking is bad.

But you insist that you are not in fact smoking anything, in 20 years we are going to elect and re-elect a president named Barack Hussein Obama, and you will be alive to see it. You also insist that in 40 years it will be legal for 12-year-olds to drive and hold regular jobs and buy alcohol. 

Damn kid, I thought you were smoking weed, but what we have here is an underage crack addict. Just who the hell is selling you this stuff?

But you insist that just because my 12-year-old self might have the legal right to get stoned in 60 years, that doesn't mean that I'm dumb enough to actually indulge in that sort of thing. I'm telling you, in 20 years, we're going to elect a black president named Barack Hussein Obama, Arabs will vote, and gays will marry. 20 years after that, 12-year-olds will in fact hold regular jobs and drive to work, if they even need to drive to work at all because most of the jobs of the future are all in handheld devices. 20 years after that, 12-year-olds will be serving in the military, because the wars of the future are pretty much robots blowing up robots and hacking into other computers, and 12-year-olds are better at doing that sort of thing than adults. 

Okay kid, now I'm certain you're not smoking crack. You just have a bad case of an underage imagination. Go back to reading Ender's Game. Now stop wasting my time with your childish musings on what the future holds, you're just a goddamn kid and you think you've got it all figured out. You'll grow up and realize what we old people have always known, that the way things are are the way things always will be, and radical ideas never, ever become mainstream, and if they do it's always 100 years after my sorry adult ass won't have to be alive to see it. In 6 years you'll turn 18, you'll be legally able to vote, and you'll have a choice between voting for two similar overaged white guys, just like me.

But you smile and laugh to yourself, because you know this man is wrong, in 20 years he's gonna be in for one hell of a shock when Barack Hussein Obama swears himself in on national television, exactly as you said it would happen. You hope he doesn't have a heart attack when he lives to see the day that 12-year-olds are voting for the first latino woman president, or the first Muslim president, or the first gay president. Because there's a decent chance this man will be denying the reality that's been bubbling right underneath his nose until he sees it on the TV.

Many youth rights advocates will probably never see it coming either, the same way that many black folks who marched for the right to vote never believed that they'd actually live to see the day that YouTube and Facebook and voting algorithms would make it possible. The most radical youth rights advocate is still a product of his time, and right now the youth rights movement isn't really a movement, it's just a constellation of industrial-era advocacy groups, their digital footprint at the mercy of shallow Web 2.0 bluster that doesn't really amount to anything. You're reading this essay on Reddit, and who knows maybe on Facebook or some outdated youth rights message board. There's much more to the digital realm than what you see on the surface, but I don't think Youth Rights has anyone like Larry Page or Steve Jobs or Christopher Poole running the show. At least not yet. Screw Web 2.0, what about Web 3.0 and 4.0 and beyond? Has anyone in youth rights been able to nail down social futurism, or even understand how it works in the information age? The best we have is Dr. Epstein, and awesome as he is, he might as well be distributing hand-cranked pamphlets.

When will we be ready for a 12-year-old president? When society finally realizes that no, you're not smarter than a 5th grader, the average 5th grader has access to the same exact information that you do and knows how to use it better. The pace of technology has made this possible, and we're just at the beginning of a very rapid upwards curve. Toddlers and infants are using iPhones, and whatever replaces the iPhone will also be used by toddlers and infants. Expect to see underaged brains getting a lot bigger in a very short amount of time.

I'm absolutely certain that I will live to see a 12-year-old president. The question we have to ask is when do we grow a pair and start advocating for something that sounds downright insane, instead of just convenient? I think we'll know it when the time comes, and that time will be sooner than we think. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/16yt7q/how_many_years_until_well_be_ready_for_a/,0,"> the average 5th grader has access to the same exact information that you do and knows how to use it better.

If this were true, then did the 10+ years I spent in school *after* the 5th grade actually made me worse off? It is a preposterous statement used to back up a preposterous position.

No one is going to vote for a person who hasn't even rented an apartment or paid an electricity bill. A 12-year-old just doesn't have enough life experience to understand the world in the way a President absolutely must. ",2013-01-21 03:09:56
933,poq5z,False,None,118,The Truth About Child Sexualization,YouthRights,"Suppose we defined all activities on the part of women, other than kitchen work, child care, and sucking their husband's off on command, as the ""Masculinization of Women.""

It would then follow that all aspirations on the part of women to do things like standing up for equal rights, or pursuing a career outside the home, were not the result of personal entrepreneurship, but rather a result of the women having been ""Masculinized.""

We'd have to ban all advocacy that women deserved a larger role in society, including subreddits devoted to the topic, and pictures of women doing things other than housework, as ""Women Masculinization Material.""

Even legal ""Women Masculinization"" discussions would have to stop, lest the forum hosting them be drawn into some complicated ""legal quagmire.""

Such changes on policy would of course be ""necessary,"" and dissenters would wind up on some list of people who are ""Part of the Problem of Women Masculinization."" Women who protested would be forced into reparative therapy to cure them of their ""Masculinization"" which would be a billion dollar industry for quacks.

Now of course, the political strategy here, is that if you can represent someone's goals not as a result of their own initiative, but rather as the result of some malevolent force having corrupted them, then anything becomes justifiable to ""protect"" them.

Thus we see the whole ""Child Sexualization"" bandwagon not as a genuine attempt to protect kids, but as a proxy war against youth sexuality itself.

Goodness knows we allow lots of other content that harms kids, like the glorification of fathers who shoot bullets into their kids laptops, and post videos on YouTube about it.

But suggest someone under 18 might be attractive, or possess a pair of working genitals, and you're the Second Coming of Satan.

Kids really need to fight back against this type of nonsense, because adults stating the obvious here just get themselves labeled, made targets, and end up being accused of having ulterior motives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/poq5z/the_truth_about_child_sexualization/,0,"""child sexualization"" asumes that children arent sexual to begin with. It implies that children are little asexual beings. Which is is of course complete BS. ",2012-02-14 05:46:11
